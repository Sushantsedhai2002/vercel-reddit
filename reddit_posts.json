They have deluded themselves into thinking that he won't come after them. The truth is, there's not much stopping him from revoking their visas if he wants to.

In the city I live, I would say more Nepali folks are Republicans supporters than Democrats.   It's quite interesting to listen to these folks.|||Why is this?? I see it, even amongst a family|||Hmm generalizing blatantly. So typical.   I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I have seen such trends as well, even here people were rejoicing when Trump suspended DV program.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.    Tell them to f*** themselves and breed—they’ll regret this mindset for the rest of their lives.

Because you are making some substantial claims here.  Edit: I guess people are fine with unsubstantiated claims ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ But this is exactly how misinformation spreads.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders. Nepali people don’t want any immigrants in Nepal and are super racist, but when they face similar treatment abroad, they’re first to complain. They’ve already gotten their citizenship, why should they care about you or any other future immigrant?",

His father always asks us to come over and help them manage the resort in case any group starts misbehaving.. it's a regular occurrence there , so much so that we and the hotel owners have a group to alert others for help in case some group gets too rowdy and have had to throw groups of young guys past 1/2 in the morning for misbehaving with other guests and causing trouble for the hotel owners .|||Please share video links if any.|||Any indian sub that we can cross post???|||My personal opinion - I think it's all because of mayor of Pokhara who is busy running away from the city because of his controversies.

            "body": "Today I saw someone wearing earphones while traveling. When I got off the bus, a few other people also had earphones in. I had no idea what they were listening to.  When I got home, my sister was cleaning her room, and she had music playing in the background. I realized that I myself scroll endlessly on autopilot.  The content I consume affects my thinking, mindset, the way I act and behave, and even how I see the world.  And I wondered: why do I need to know about a celebrity’s life when I don’t even know them? Yet again, I found myself consuming information in a never-ending loop.  The music we listen to, the movies we watch, the books we read, and the content we consume all shape our worldview, and in this constant process of consumption, I feel I’m losing my originality.  There’s no real me. I’ve copied everything. I don’t even give myself time to think.  We do so many things for attention and validation, acting superficially and avoiding confronting ourselves. And more and more, I’m starting to believe the quote:  >*“All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”*  Rumi also said:  >*“Half of life is lost in charming others. The other half is lost in going through anxieties caused by others. Leave this play. You have played enough.”*  Boredom is something we should aim for, because it’s where we finally meet our true selves.  But in the modern era, we rarely get the space to be bored because countless devices are designed to keep us busy.  I read Arthur Schopenhauer’s essays a month ago, and his words have stayed with me ever since:  >“From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his eyes.”  >“For to read in every spare moment, and to read constantly, is more paralysing to the mind than constant manual work, which, at any rate, allows one to follow one’s own thoughts.”  >“And so it happens that the person who reads a great deal — that is to say, almost the whole day, and recreates himself by spending the intervals in thoughtless diversion, gradually loses the ability to think for himself; just as a man who is always riding at last forgets how to walk.”  Nowadays, I’m distancing myself from all kinds of information, even “good” ones like podcasts, blogs, books, and tweets, because I’ve consumed so much that I just need space to think. Of course, I’m still focusing on my core skills and subjects.  It’s been months since I last listened to songs. I don’t watch movies at all either, not by choice, but naturally. I simply don’t find anything there. I’ve forced myself several times to watch movies because people say cinema is beautiful, but I couldn’t connect. Lately, I’ve been feeling calmer and clearer than ever before.  One thing I’ve noticed is that songs, movies, and similar forms of media often trigger emotions for no real reason. They end up controlling our emotions more than we realize.  Instead, I sometimes listen to classical music, which gives me space to think. We’re so used to playing songs, listening to podcasts, doomscrolling, and doing all of this while walking or doing random things, but I’ve cut that off too. Now, during those moments, I simply enjoy the present. I give myself the space to be bored.  Everywhere I look, I see information in some form. Everyone is becoming a creator, and everywhere there’s more and more content. Honestly, it feels hopeless to me.  It’s overwhelming to process, and our mind isn’t built for this constant stream of input.  We are constantly scrolling, searching as if something better is always out there. We feel like if we don’t, we’ll miss out.  This endless search is one of the biggest sources of anxiety and stress.  There’s too much “good stuff” out there, and we are all trying to consume it all. We are looking for something we don’t even know, and it’s killing us slowly. And yet, we haven’t even noticed it.

Because of the company’s bullying culture, I decided to leave the moment I hear the terms like unpaid probation and delayed contracts.   Recently i joined some company they delayed my contract letter before i signed there contract i left. Later, the bullying escalated—they even threatened legal action,  i replied  I was never an employee blocked the number returned company hoodie(  using in-drive they even asked for (khako paisa imagine how cheap these people can go), despite the fact that there was no written contract during my time there. Now that they haven’t been able to find a replacement i guess, the threats have continued.  In one of my earlier companies, there was a tea/coffee vending machine, but staff weren’t allowed to drink milk coffee. There was no restroom for clients, and meat products were banned in the shared kitchen. Major chai you have to respond the client  and company at any public days pani or attend there webinar cause India has sunday holidays.  At another company before that, the contractor tricked me into staying under an agreement where I was supposed to be paid part-time based on the number of students. The problem was that it was completely off-season thats why they hired him. Salary was based on number of students. I have to be there early morning to open there office. To find out there is no students for months.   At yet another company, they had a so-called one-week probation followed by a 1–3 month internship kaam salary. Even after eight months, I was still stuck as an intern, so I eventually left.  There are so many issues with Nepali private companies that talking about them never seems to end. If they can’t keep their staff happy, attracting and retaining clients is out of the question.  One thing I’ve learned: once your is salary  is issued start and once you receive another offer, it’s best to switch off the phone and do what you know is right….. they will find next bakra…  Until then, keep pushing forward—lagey raho, Munna bhai.",

            "body": "I was flying from Nepal to the USA with Turkish Airlines. I know the baggage allowance clearly: 23 + 23 kg checked, 12 kg carry-on. At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

I think they’ll be shocked and disgusted at how low wages for their colleagues around the world are.|||my experience has been fine going to US from nepal most times. your carry on was 20kg? that’s crazy. most airlines are 8 kg max. that’s your fault.|||Sucks man.. Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||I posted a very relevant comment to this post about 10 hrs ago and the mods removed it with no explanation.  Here’s the whole thing that was removed:   Third party companies that provide contract services to the airlines are Nepalese companies that practice this and I say this from my own experience. I got scammed for upwards of $375 for something similar in 2024. I disputed the charges with my cc company (didn’t have time , would’ve missed the flight if not paid at the time) however they only replied to AMEX on the very last day of the dispute window with false evidence to close the case. I had no way to reopen the case and I got tired of calling the company itself. I felt helpless. It is an ongoing scam. I’ve heard a few of the similar stories from others as well. Go to the airport with enough time in hand, never pack your luggage to the max weight limit. Be firm and confident, report to the authorities, record video for evidence. I can only suggest options that may or may not work. No wonder people hate going back home from abroad. TIA has always been a bad experience.|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

When he started to be more pushy asking for $$ I mentioned that I’m not worried about it and ik someone here ( as in the airport).

There’s corruption everywhere in the airport. IMS group controls the airport, god knows how much they paid in corruption money to be able to do that and how much corruption money they get paid back in return through their control. The normal everyday workers working in bhansar get shitloads in corruption money as there are news about people smuggling things in the airport everyday, and those are the unsuccessful cases, thousands of cases we don’t even about that happens everyday. I know someone who worked in airport bhansar and had so much corruption money that their house was under custody by the CIAA and they were only a normal employee.

I know a lot of you here are RSP supporters, so I am only asking you to please not be one dimensional. Analyze multiple variables and evaluate the scenario. Ask questions, if you support 99 things and question one aspect then you still are their supporter. Don't be pressured to defend everything.  Some sample questions:   1. Why did Rabi dai get another letter from attorney general\\[1\\] to kill the case and not go through the court process. What if mutton kaji also gets the similar letter from attorney general to silence his बाख्रा काण्ड, or बा? And for that matter anyone else make such letter. Rabi dai has already gotten it in two cases, one yesterday\\[1\\] and another for his dual passport case.  2. One prominent leader of RSP yesterday  in an interview said, \"The public has NO RIGHT to  not give RSP at least 138 seats in the parliament\"?\\[2\\]. Do you find that wording may be questionable, are you sure the other prominent ones in RSP don't feel the same? Is that mindset correct and logical?  3. Constantly attacking the ones who leave, Sumana (opportunist), Santhos Pariyar (opportunist), Mukul Dhakal (Opportunist), Kulman (opportunist) etc. All of them have expressed that RSP is run like a private company. Do you not have to regard political party fully transparent and trustworthy because they are PUBLIC instutions? Do you think may be they have merit in their conclusion, that the leadership model might be individualistic?  4. Most importantly, do we require policies, vision clarity and concrete plans to change the country for good? Is \"replacing the old guards\" enough for the kind of improvement we want? Do we not require intelligence, capability, knowledge, etc to take a whole COUNTRY forward? Social media likes and comments surely are not enough right?  and more questions.  I know I will get a lot of abuse from the majority of you, but that is ok(bring your best abuses, be creative, jhole is kind of lame). I will also ask a very tiny fraction of you, who actually question, to please not be totally demoralized. If we make enough requests and endure enough abuse, we might be able to convert one person to question on this.  \\[1\\]: [https://www.setopati.com/politics/379612](https://www.setopati.com/politics/379612)   \\[2\\]: [https://youtu.be/Hf2Oto0HZJs?t=4429](https://youtu.be/Hf2Oto0HZJs?t=4429)",

The root-cause behind all of this cult-support of political parties imo is the social-engineering by congress/yemale.  Political sister orgs (cpngress/uml) everywhere, party-allocations in all gov appointments, benefit of political connection, and thier entire families faith-based political suppurt-- Congress/UML are the biggest cult-based and coercion-based party in our society.  Imagine what it takes to get out of that?  Ultra strong resolve, frustration... thats what makes them such ardent independent or alternate party supporters.  Thats why, one of the key voting voting agenda for me is which party takes stand against party-fication of our society. At least, RSP stands for that.|||1. First of all, Rabi's sahakari case is still going and what is now being withdrawn is Organised crime and money laundering case which many legal experts and ordinary people said was designed to keep Rabi Lamichhane out of active politics for years. If those cases hadn't been withdrawn then Rabi would have been automatically suspended even if he had won the coming election and it could have taken years to resolve the case. So what Rabi did was send a letter to Attorney general office to revisit the case and they did and found out several problems with that case and it was recommended to withdraw them. Many of us believe that both these cases were filed against Rabi due to political pressure exerted on the local attorney office and now the political pressure has been lifted. Also, very important to remember that almost no politician who has had sahakari case filed against them, also had both organised crime and money laundering case against them.    2. That's just one RSP leader talking, it can't be the opinion of one party and people are free to vote for whomever they want but if they want real change this time yes they should give RSP a majority so that Balen can be our new Prime minister.    3. RSP party as a whole has never attacked them officially, they have requested them to come back but some individual RSP members have and it is their choice. RSP i feel is totally transparent like they have submitted their financial records to Election commission regularly. RSP was formed just 3 years ago and whenever a new party is formed, the only way it can get real success is via a popular face (otherwise how come only RSP got 21 seats but so many other new parties got nothing). Now soon, the general convention is gonna happen and it will sort things out.    4. Replacing the old guards is absolutely the most important thing right now and yes we need visions and plans which would be presented when RSP gets its party manifesto out and when Rabi, Balen and their other candidates begin to campaign.    At the end, I don't fault anyone for asking questions but my assertion is that most of us youths have no choice but to vote for RSP this time and try to make Balen Prime minister. Are they perfect?? Absolutely not but let's give them a chance and see for ourself and if they do bad then we will vote for someone else and if they good we will vote for them again. I'm sick and tired of Nepalis believing that we should vote for NC and UML this time and maybe they will really change. No thank you.|||Yei ho .. arulai jholey vanda vandai afu uniharu vanda arajak vako dekhdainan kasaile. Question garyo vane manpari Gali khainxa . Garo xa naya lai kei vannu hudaina|||RSP feels like a cult now, not a party. There is no critical thinking among its supporters. They treat RSP as an institution that targets anyone who speaks against it—whether it’s comments on Sumana’s post or the recent hate against Kulman. The leaders of RSP feel entitled, and I don’t see a good way out now.|||>Is \"replacing the old guards\" enough for the kind of improvement we want?     What you want doesn't come out from air. What \"replacinv the old\" shows is that public still have power to change leaders if leaders don't do what they should do.

Yet they still continue theyre bullying. Ktm has limited ppl, word gets out. Better to quit before too late|||How’s the pay btw?|||CG Communication is the same, totally same😞, I'm the victim, i wanna quit, but i got. My family got no other income sources, i forced to stay under their demands or some, man it's draining, make u question reality, affects mental status, Crappy system, Nepal Sucks in terms of these shi|||expose them, expose the nepos|||Not vaidya group but same thing happened to me, and it was a major reason I left the company. Because of the company’s bullying culture, I decided to leave the moment I hear the terms like unpaid probation and delayed contracts. Recently i joined some company they delayed my contract letter before i signed there contract i left. Later, the bullying escalated—they even threatened legal action,  i replied  I was never an employee blocked the number returned company hoodie(  using in-drive they even asked for (khako paisa imagine how cheap these people can go), despite the fact that there was no written contract during my time there. Now that they haven’t been able to find a replacement i guess, the threats have continued.   In one of my earlier companies, there was a tea/coffee vending machine, but staff weren’t allowed to drink milk coffee. There was no restroom for clients, and meat products were banned in the shared kitchen. Major chai you have to respond the client  and company at any public days pani or attend there webinar cause India has sunday holidays.    At another company before that, the contractor tricked me into staying under an agreement where I was supposed to be paid part-time based on the number of students. The problem was that it was completely off-season thats why they hired him. Salary was based on number of students. I have to be there early morning to open there office.   At yet another company, they had a so-called one-week probation followed by a 1–3 month internship kaam salary. Even after eight months, I was still stuck as an intern, so I eventually left.  There are so many issues with Nepali private companies that talking about them never seems to end. If they can’t keep their staff happy, attracting and retaining clients is out of the question.  One thing I’ve learned: once your is salary  is issued start and once you receive another offer, it’s best to switch off the phone and do what you know is right….. they will find next bakra…   Until then, keep pushing forward—lagey raho, Munna bhai.",

I want to ask you for your kindness and support. I really need your help, for Liam.  Liam was born on August 2023 and from the very first day Liam brought love into our lives. Liam is a boy Liam is a joyful boy and Liam is full of life. Liam loves going to the beach Liam loves to laugh. Liam loves warm cuddles with his parents. When people look at Liam they see a boy who looks perfectly healthy.  There is a lot of pain behind that smile. The diagnosis that we got has really hurt us deeply. It has broken our hearts into pieces. The diagnosis is very hard for us to accept. It is a tough time, for us and the diagnosis of this thing is what is causing us so much sadness.  Liam has something called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. This is a bad disease that gets worse over time. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will make it so Liam cannot walk or run anymore. He will not be able to lift his arms up. Eventually Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will even make it hard for Liam to breathe on his own.  There is no way to make Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy go away now.. If Liam gets help early like special exercises and doctor visits it can make him feel a little better. This help can also make Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy not get worse, as fast.  Liams family is doing everything they can to help Liam. His mum, Nirjala and the rest of the family want to give Liam the chance. The problem is that the cost of care and therapies for Liam is very high. The cost of treatment options, for Liam is also very high. It is too much for Liams family to pay for everything on their own. They need help to pay for the care and therapies that Liam needs. Liams family wants to give Liam the chance but they cannot do it alone.  We have set up:  A GoFundMe for international supporters  There is a payment option in Nepal that uses QR codes. This is for people who live in Nepal and want to help out. The people in Nepal can use this Nepali QR payment option to make payments. This way they can help people, in Nepal.  If you are able to donate even a small amount of money can make a difference to the fundraiser. If you are not able to donate money then sharing this post or the fundraiser is just as valuable, as donating money to the fundraiser.  Liam deserves the chance to grow up surrounded by love, care and hope. I want to say thank you for taking the time to read this. I also want to thank you for being a person and, for any help you are able to give to Liam.

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Nice, thats the way to go!

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

            "body": "I’ve been on both sides of interviews, both taking them and giving them, and one pattern keeps showing up.  Different engineers can solve the same problem in very different ways, and that’s completely fine. There’s rarely a single “correct” solution. What matters much more to me is how the technical conversation is structured and how the candidate thinks through the problem when constraints and ambiguity are involved.  I’ve noticed many candidates jump straight to advanced tools or complex architectures. They can name frameworks confidently and describe setups that sound impressive. But when you dig a bit deeper and ask *why* certain choices were made, the fundamentals are often unclear. Basic trade-offs, assumptions, data size considerations, or failure scenarios are sometimes missing from the discussion.  With AI tools now widely available, writing code itself is no longer the hardest part. Generating a working solution is relatively easy. What’s harder, and far more valuable, is having a strong grasp of fundamentals: understanding the problem clearly, framing it correctly, reasoning about constraints, and explaining why a particular approach makes sense over others.  When I evaluate candidates, I don’t expect perfect or complete code. In many cases, a clear approach or even well-explained pseudo-code is more than enough. It tells me how someone thinks, how they reason, and whether they can build solutions incrementally instead of jumping straight to complexity.  I’m curious how others see this.  For those who interview regularly, how do you judge candidates? Do you prioritize fundamentals and problem-solving approach, or do tools and implementation details carry more weight for you?",

I noticed the webapp was getting daily 20+ visitors and it made me think what sort of feature I could add for those people.

In this example, you can see a 300+ character social media content planner prompt being compressed to 141 characters, achieving around 63% cost savings while using different SOTA models.  Later, I tested injecting the compressed prompt into a SOTA model, and it accurately decoded it, generating all the social media content planning.  if interested check it out at: [www.promptoverflow.app](http://www.promptoverflow.app)",

In developed countries, inflation, food prices, gas prices, taxes play important role in elections and candidates base their campaign on economic policies too. That's rarely seen in Nepal, and we should start focusing on that. As a voter, we should be questioning our candidates about their economy policies, how taxes will be changed when they come to power, how they'll cut government spending (or increase), how they'll fund to fulfil their promises of manifesto. In case of Nepal, unemployment is big factor and job generation is not possible without proper coordination with private sector. Its private sector who create jobs and the party going to election must have clear idea how they'll ease private sector investment that'll eventually create jobs. These should be the most important things in my opinion.  Because of swarnim wagle's presence in RSP, I have some hopes. He probably won't put unrealistic populist ideas in their manifesto and if RSP wins the elections, he can drive economy well.   I am hopeful.",

Had he not left Congress back then today he would have been a leading figure in the Gagan lead Congress!|||masu bhat ma vote dine manxe haru ley economy ko bare question garxan jasto lagxa?  jan tin tauke lai ta chunab jintnu xa because of the ego, hami lai kasari goverment bahira nikaley...|||Many people whose understanding of economy is west = good, you can ignore me, they spend billions on propaganda and I can't change your mind with a comment. But for folks who are a bit skeptical  Swornim Wagley, this is the same mf who recommended to cut the army and keep like 50k or even 10k men, mf worked for world bank, said sri lanka should get IMF bailout and do the \"structural adjustment\", which is basically drop all government services, privatize everything, sell them for pennies to blackrock. He always promotes economic liberalization.  If you know even a little bit about global economy, the most successful Industrial economy when it comes to growth and making overall lives of people better is China, and they outright reject economic liberalization, and believe capital should be strictly controlled by visible hand of the state. I believe loosening our capital control and fully liberalizing the economy is dangerous. His entry into RSP made me drop support for them. My problem with the party is strictly economic.|||For me, maybe implementation of anti corruption policies is the highest priority. Right now, every party says \"Bhrastachar hataunchu. Bhrastachar garnu galat\" but no one says \"Ma esari hataunchu. Yo policy lyaunchu\". This matters because policy chaina bhane guffai ta ho. Ani Q&A session hunuparcha jasto lagcha with journalist with queries such as \"Karmachari Union le policy ko against ma pen down garyo bhane k garnu huncha\".|||I agree, Wagle is a gem and hopefully he becomes our new finance minister.|||Shhh yesto kura garyo vane ta Bideshi agent vanihalchan ni ani !!!

Dr. Man Mohan Singh was clear example how a economist can uprise country from the mud. India was only having foreign reserves lasting about a week when Dr. Singh took the charge. His economic policies, and policies of globalization brought major reforms to India and currently they're standing as the 5th largest economy of the world. Hoping some positive changes from Dr. Wagle|||This wagle can’t be trusted mark my word|||Politics is boring. Politics is about narcissistic people playing and struggling to grasp power. People who don't get bored playing endless drama, even when they get old. It's not about some greater good or the good of the people. They say that to appease the crowd. They are actually psychologically insane. However, there are few people who are actually leaders and not politicians. They desire to make the country prosperous and make people's lives better. Only true leaders can make politics look good and watchable.|||I want Swornim as Finance Minister and Secretary of Finance Ministry as Rameshwor Khanal.|||Swornim Wagle congress mai vako vaye maybe i would have gone with Congress   Congress lost a visionary Economist   Gagan ji has a policy oriented mindset, Wagle ji ko tyo vanda ek step mathi xa. I'm sure he'll transform the fiscal policy of nepal|||Wagle is a qualified person. But, he has yet to be tested.   His proposal on decreasing army isn’t good which played critical role after genZ revolution. This country is still unstable.  Also, i do not know what his contribution was during his work as national planner.     Hope, he makes better decisions.",

Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

            "body": "I was flying from Nepal to the USA with Turkish Airlines. I know the baggage allowance clearly: 23 + 23 kg checked, 12 kg carry-on. At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Hamro Nepal ma airport employees huney bittikai 3 wota ghar, 2 wota gaadi, “Airport ma kaam garchha” bhanne dhaak. Kaam garne bhaney jaabo airport ma. I think they’ll be shocked and disgusted at how low wages for their colleagues around the world are.|||my experience has been fine going to US from nepal most times. your carry on was 20kg? that’s crazy. most airlines are 8 kg max. that’s your fault.|||Sucks man.. Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||I posted a very relevant comment to this post about 10 hrs ago and the mods removed it with no explanation.  Here’s the whole thing that was removed:   Third party companies that provide contract services to the airlines are Nepalese companies that practice this and I say this from my own experience. I got scammed for upwards of $375 for something similar in 2024. I disputed the charges with my cc company (didn’t have time , would’ve missed the flight if not paid at the time) however they only replied to AMEX on the very last day of the dispute window with false evidence to close the case. I had no way to reopen the case and I got tired of calling the company itself. I felt helpless. It is an ongoing scam. I’ve heard a few of the similar stories from others as well. Go to the airport with enough time in hand, never pack your luggage to the max weight limit. Be firm and confident, report to the authorities, record video for evidence. I can only suggest options that may or may not work. No wonder people hate going back home from abroad. TIA has always been a bad experience.|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there? I think that’s what needs to be done to teach them a lesson.|||Just report to the CIAA online. They take such complaints seriously.|||Same shit measured 22 kg at home, weighted 28 kg at airport 😂|||Most of the weighing machines dont give accurate results there.Flucuation of 1-2kg is normal there These flucuations have got added there Ig.And the shady part is Its not upto the standard(Its just working so noone cares).|||Same happend to me aswell, when i travel from ktm to germany.

I did weigh my luggages and suddenly this man had the audacity to claim that I’m not allowed to carry this much. However, I knew this can’t be possible and it seemed very scammy.  When he started to be more pushy asking for $$ I mentioned that I’m not worried about it and ik someone here ( as in the airport). Right after that he stopped bothering me and went to another dude to try his bs.  After this, I asked the front staff( a lady) working in the counter and she said I’m allowed to carry xx kg for my carry on and I’m fine.|||I always go 2 kg below weight. Never had issue.|||Allowed weight:43 kg  Nepali s luggage:42.99999999kg|||That’s not a TIA problem.

The general practice I have seen is they are usually 7-10 kg for carry on; and for checked in luggage allowance 23-32 kg.|||We talk about corruption in politics but corruption in the airport needs to be talked about a lot more than we do. There’s corruption everywhere in the airport. IMS group controls the airport, god knows how much they paid in corruption money to be able to do that and how much corruption money they get paid back in return through their control. The normal everyday workers working in bhansar get shitloads in corruption money as there are news about people smuggling things in the airport everyday, and those are the unsuccessful cases, thousands of cases we don’t even about that happens everyday. I know someone who worked in airport bhansar and had so much corruption money that their house was under custody by the CIAA and they were only a normal employee.

Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation.

Sending love ❤️|||yo jasto maxne will never change tara its your choice whether you will leave or not ani plz if u stay, bacha haru na palnu 🙏|||Hello, this is not normal..... Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place. But please don't give up, gather your courage and try leaving this toxic relationship.  Maya ko naam ma aafno life barbaad nagarnus please. YO situation bata jasari bhaye ni niskinu try garnus. Legally  bhaye wa personally huncha, help magnus. Aafnai income cha bhane, you've got nothing to be scared of. It might be scary being alone at first but life is too long to be stuck in a relationship where you are being hurt constantly.   So OP, please try getting out of this relation  as soon as you can.|||i would never even think of doing anything like that to my wife. hamro pani katti jhagada chai parirako hunchha. thak-thuk wala type. tyo level ma escalate bhako chai i do not think is normal. get rid of that relationship. you deserve better.  i am a married man, i would never even think of anything like that is my life. tyo level ko trust issue suru hunubhanda paile nei i would opt to separate. i think you should report him to the police and separate for the better of both of you.|||Do you live in Saudi Arabia?

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

            "body": "As part of our standard check-in procedure in our hotel, when a couple arrives, we require government-issued IDs from both individuals and both signatures on the registration form.  But, I observed that we are frequently facing resistance especially when requesting the girl’s ID and signature. Most of the couple argue saying this rule exists “only in our hotel” or refuse outright. Because of this, a lot of young couples choose not to stay.  Our intention behind this policy is not to harass or embarrass anyone. There are clear reasons for it:  Both signatures confirm mutual consent to stay esp in regards to couples, protecting both guests and the hotel from future disputes or false claims.  Both IDs are important for legal accountability in case of any incident, complaint, or investigation.  Plus it also verifies the real age of both individuals, ensuring there are no underage- related legal issues.  Despite being a reputed hotel and following this policy consistently for safety and legal compliance, we’re now questioning whether this is seen as excessive.  So my genuine question is: Are we being too strict by asking for both partners’ IDs and signatures?????",

Kathmandu etc. You sure have CCTV camera in public places in hotel so that should cover most cases. I think its a bit excessive to ask both ID. There should be a sweet spot between security and privacy so asking one ID imo is good compromise.|||A significant portion of your guests are going to be couples. Your demand for both id will surely make most of the couple either go somewhere else or not return again to your hotel.

Are you checking ID of everyone or just couple or just those who look young ?  Unless another person look or around under age , two ID is unnecessary.

When the 2025 Gen Z movement happened, the country was ready to give Balen everything. He chose to pass that power to an interim government led by Sushila Karki. We trusted her because he told us to. Today, as 76 families still wait for justice and the murderers are still protected, why is the man who gave the guarantee staying silent? Is silence a leadership quality, or is it an exit strategy?  People call Harka 'aggressive' or 'a laborer.' But remember: this man refused a Home Ministry post because he wouldn't bow at a foreign embassy for a 'stamp of approval.' He chose the soil over a seat. While the privileged mock his 'muddy hands,' he is the only one showing us what a sovereign leader looks like. Why are we so comfortable with 'polite' silence and so offended by 'honest' noise?

The CEO repeatedly blamed me and expected an intern to take ownership of the entire application.

There was no proper guidance provided to interns, but the CEO expected intern-level employees to perform at the level of senior software engineers.|||Ma ta jata gayo sab mero against ma morchabandi garera malai eklai parera sab milera mero kura katdai basxan.

It is our luck in which bucket we fall .|||One big red flag for me has always been “everything is urgent all the time.” When poor planning gets disguised as hustle and you’re constantly expected to stay late or be available 24/7, burnout comes fast. Also managers who say “we’re like a family” but shut down feedback or punish boundaries. Learned that the hard way!|||Heres my story.   I worked in an American Company. I had initially worked in a department  that handles projects. Then I switched to another department seeking growth.  I served in the department for a year. Then the Head of our function decided they wanted to switch departments. When they moved the business deemed our function redundant and moved our team to completely random teams. (Red Flag 1)   I was placed into a function which I had no idea about. It was not my strength, and I had asked countless times to move me. Additionally my manager was a person who was not understanding at all. They had developed a role that was well above my current grade. When I confronted them about it, they just said we'll see. (Red Flag 2)  My manager then began to criticize everything I did. They began to complain about everything. From my working hours to the way I completed work. When I reported a problem, after proactively checking in with the respective stakeholders, my manager's response was to criticize me because I did not report this problem earlier. I like to automate things, she criticized me claiming  I was lazy and I looked to automate everything. (Red Flag 3)   Regardless of these situations, I decided to persevere and keep on working. Unfortunately I got really sick with Migraines. I sent my manager photos of my thermometer and the doctors note. They approved my leave without any fuss which was kinda suspicious.   When I joined work back on Monday. My manager was awfully chill about everything. They wanted to schedule a meeting with me. Being naive i didn't think too much of it but I could see that HR and Finance Managers were also in the meeting. I understood what was about to happen. I joined the meeting and got laid off.   TLDR: The workplace was trying to get rid of me, and avoid paying severance by placing me with an awful manager. However, I persevered and played along and got some severance in the end.|||hired as a intern (for final yr colz), worked web dev, winform dev, tech support. assigned whole website and ERP alone. sometimes, techsupport whole day with no time to do webapp, constantly rushed by coworkers and boss to complete the app while asking me to give techsupport (so sometimes even worked overtime at home). I already had 2-3yrs of experience in web dev before joining but was new to winform and techsupport.  the female coworkers had bad experience with boss and his son, they urged me to leave as well and I'm glad I did. I stayed there for 3 months, helped make company site and a management app alone, also some apps for automation and QOL.  they didn't paid me for 2months and I was about to leave but they offered me senior position afterwards, yet I left. Later they asked me to submit my projects and they would pay me my salary, I did, they never did. I called, do whatever you want I wont be giving it back.  After leaving still with no job but glad I left.|||I've been lucky to get amazing managers to work with. Instead of red flags, I can tell you what made them great managers.   No. 1 ta micromanage nagarne nai ho. Arko chai supportive culture ho, meaning they are always looking out for your well-being and becoming patient towards juniors. Mistakes teach you lessons, tara toxic culture ma mistakes are discouraged entirely. You should also not be afraid to share ideas and vision with your manager. When there is fear, there are limited learning opportunities and it ultimately shows in your mental health.|||Damn... it's a looooong story..😰",

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal.

Many companies lack basic knowledge of labor regulations and do not understand how to properly treat employees or how to handle hiring and termination processes.  I have personally experienced this multiple times, including facing discrimination during interviews. The HR policies in many Nepalese companies are extremely weak and poorly implemented.

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

Not worth wasting time.|||AIconf kasto thyo baru?|||I kind of get your point, but also see the value in the event. 350 for enterprise AI adoption is cheap. If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

She (and her friends from Uni) has been applying for Software Eng job/intern for the past 6 months. No luck yet.  I (5 years exp as Software dev) came here few months ago as her dependent. So no work restriction for me.   Started applying for Software ENg jobs, mostly through Seek and LinkedIn.   Applied to around 50-60ish places over the period of 2 months, while working at a grocery store on the side      Got reply from only 2 places where 1 one of them was a scammer.   Managed to get an actual interview in the other one (backend with Golang), where I got the job.

I was asked to fill this info in almost every job application.   \\- It’s very very difficult to land an interview. The interview itself was not that big of a deal in my experience.    \\- If you go to regional, it becomes more difficult. a friend of mine was laid off as a software engineer like 6 months ago in Perth, still hasn’t managed to find a new job.|||Hopefully people respond to this as i am in a similar predicament|||Following|||want more comments on this|||/r/NepalAbroad|||Following",

            "body": "I’m a Go developer building a SaaS product. After integrating eSewa, Khalti, and ConnectIPS for the third time, I’ve decided I’m done writing \"glue code\" for every new project.  I am going to build a **Unified Nepal Payments Core** in Go.  I’m building this regardless because I need it for my own production environment, but I wanted to check with developer here if you have faced same problem and how you have solved it?  **The Problem I’m Solving (For myself, and maybe you):**  1. Architecture Mismatch: eSewa forces a legacy HTML Form POST. Khalti is JSON. ConnectIPS needs certificates. My business logic shouldn't care about these transport details. I just want a clean interface. 2. Verification Anxiety: Most tutorials I see online skip the strict signature/HMAC verification steps. I want a library that handles the crypto correctly by default so I don't have to worry about replay attacks or amount spoofing. 3. Standardized Errors: I’m tired of parsing inconsistent error responses. I want the SDK to return a standard `payment.ErrInsufficientFunds` or `payment.ErrTimeout` regardless of the underlying provider.  **The Plan:**  A \"two-layer\" architecture:  1. **Core (Open Source):** The interfaces, data models, and verification logic. 2. **Providers:** Plugins for eSewa, Khalti, IPS, etc.  **The Interface Goal:**      // 1. Setup (done once)     client := esewa.New(os.Getenv(\"ESEWA_SECRET\"))     // 2. Pay (Standard across all providers)     // I don't care if it's a Form POST or API call internally     resp, err := core.Initiate(ctx, client, &payment.Request{                  Amount: 1000,                  OrderID: \"ORD-101\",                  })  I know many developer here are Node/Python, but for the Go developers in Nepal:  1. Is this something you’d actually use in production, or do you prefer writing your own integrations to keep dependencies low? 2. If I open-source the Core interfaces, would anyone be interested in helping review the security/verification logic?",

NTX gives you a quick snapshot of NEPSE listed companies - fundamentals, charts, and some mutual fund data in one place.  **Features:**  * Company details and basic info * Fundamentals (EPS, PE, ROE, P/B, etc.) * Price charts * Open-ended mutual fund holdings - see which SIP funds like NIBL Sahabhagita or Nabil Balance Fund are holding what  Live at: [https://ntx.anishshrestha.com](https://ntx.anishshrestha.com)  **Tech stack:**  * Go backend * SvelteKit frontend * ConnectRPC for typed communication between frontend and backend * Built on top of nepse-go (my other project - a Go SDK for NEPSE API)  This was mainly a learning project to get more comfortable with Go and RPC patterns. ConnectRPC generates TypeScript clients from proto definitions which keeps types in sync across the stack without manual work. Pretty nice DX if anyone's looking into it.  **Open source:** [https://github.com/voidarchive/ntx](https://github.com/voidarchive/ntx)  Fair warning - it's not a full-fledged analysis platform or anything. Just a quick way to pull up company info. Built it for my own use so there's probably edge cases I haven't handled.  If anyone wants to poke around the code, contribute, or fork it - feel free.",

These types of sellers are taking advantage of lack of easy payment access/ability for their advantage and making ridiculous profits. There is no ethical way they can give legitimate copies for the price they are let alone 200+ $40-60 games for Rs. 1500. I don't know about PS and Xbox but for Steam they are using Steam's family sharing option to share the game bought in one account to 5 or so other accounts, then give the login credentials to the buyer of a game, you download and run the game once(in case of denuvo to get a ticket) and then you have to use steam on offline mode to play the game. You are forced to use someone else's account on offline mode and won't be able to go online or change to your own account because its family share, and one game can only be played in one instance so 2 or more people can't play it at the same time hence forced offline.   With denuvo secured games like Black Myth: Wukong, it only grants 5 tickets every 24 hrs so if 5 tickets have been passed, you have to wait 1 day to launch the game before going offline, and the best part is, any sort of system modification or OS update removes the ticket(speaking from personal experience). So its a hassle regardless and these predators gain benefit. I calculated(yes really) 67k profit within 2 weeks from just one game from the story \"reviews\" of one these types of accounts.  BTW the thing with Steam family share, pretty sure what they are doing is against Steam ToS so its not any better than piracy.|||Maile 1500 ma 150+ games deal kineko tiye gamedealsnepal bata Chalxa but you can only login from one computer.

You can only play in offline mode in steam.|||You can pirate those games. I'll tell you cons and pros of buying a shared account.  Pros: - You can easily install and play games in the library.  Cons: - You never know when the account will no longer work - Cannot play online or any multiplayer (it's fully offline) - Account is shared with many people - Denuvo games might still not work properly (for eg: Denuvo let's you authenticate around 7 or 10, i forgot exact mumber. So let's say other user had already opened a game with denuvo like Black Myth Wukong then you'll have to wait for it to be 24 hours to validate Denuvo again also need to goto online and authenticate denuvo every week)  So except for easy access and install of games, it's the same as pirating.|||Saw this page and gamedeals np page selling arc raiders for like 700 smth felt sketchy so i didnt even try buying   Let me know if its real if u decide to buy from them|||Bought one with single game for rs 200/250.

Just click & play.|||Bro, just download these games from fitgirl repacks.|||Sails the 7 seas bro|||I bought fifa 25 from them no issue|||What some of you don't know(because you've likely never purchase games on steam) is that steam has a family sharing which lets you share almost every game(except live service ones like MMOs) to 5 other people. As long as you're within the same area as the family main account, you can freely \"pool\" your games and make it shared amongst everyone.  Say owner has Black myth.  Say another sharer has Darksouls 3  Say you have GTA V.  You gain access to both BM and DS, while they get access to your GTA V. But the catch is only one game can be played at a time. So if you do say, get invited, download the game, then go into offline mode, you can play the game indefinitely.  Ask with the seller if it's a shared steam account(as in someone else's credentials are involved) - which is a red flag, but if it's just family sharing the \"seller\" really doesn't lose much. Other than that ig it's free money for the \"seller\" if they're doing it that way.  https://preview.redd.it/bkg8p689xocg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b37407d0152925283095500a94005734111987",

Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

What I keep hearing from people and friends back home raises serious concerns about the tower’s commercial viability.  The issue is not the absence of a freight lift. The real issue sits with scale.  The building has a freight or service lift, but it is far too small for a high-rise of this size. Heavy furniture, industrial equipment, restaurant machinery, medical devices, or office setups will not fit or move efficiently.  In tall commercial buildings, freight lifts need large cabins and high load capacity. They support fit-outs, maintenance, and daily operations. A small service lift slows everything and forces people to misuse passenger lifts.  This reflects poor high-rise planning. Vertical transport should match the building height and purpose.  Residential use might still work. Commercial use looks compromised by design.|||Tara tyo building ko barema chai aawaz uthaunu parthyo tei ko janta le. It is just staying there, usless.

Shady past in U.S. (Active court cases) 2 Sahakari Case ( there are people - common people that are affected by his misadventure at the end of day) 3. Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker.

No salt, arbitrary food restrictions, vegetables that are suddenly “unholy” with no logical explanation. Aalu khana milcha, tara gajar khana mildaina? gai ko dudh chalcha, tara barima faleko saag khana mildaina re??  Whats more annoying is that when this person was alive, almost no one visited them. No one brought fruits then. No one showed up when it mattered. Now everyone is very serious about rituals and rules.  I wanted to participate quietly out of respect, but instead it feels like control and performance rather than genuine care or remembrance. It doesn’t feel like honoring the dead. It feels like following traditions so people can feel morally clean afterward. I’m not rejecting culture entirely. I’m questioning why rituals seem to matter more than people??!",

Many of the practices we follow today come from rules and ideas passed down by our ancestors. Some of those teachings are worth thinking about.... they can be both spiritual and logical... But the idea that nothing matters while someone is alive, and then suddenly everything becomes love and respect after death, makes no sense.

No one is going to stop you lol|||This is the ground reality check of Sanatan Rituals. Good that you raised the question. About a year ago i had to go through this procedure of 13 days for our Grandfather. I am listing Few things i had found then hope it helps:      1. Death in family can be caused with many reasons, so keeping the closest family members who shares the same house, same kitchen in a quarantine separated by cleaning with anti-bacterial natural cleaning ingredient like cow dung, ash, water - this separation for 13 days is for not communicating the disease, illness to other society members. Keeping safe distance is best way to avoid any unseen diseases.  2. Salt plays a different role in human biology - giving up salt will make you down, your metabolism decreases and your body becomes vulnerable - in this situation not having certain veggies, and food type are to keep your digestion system simple yet functional - a reminder that in life to be alive these basic things are enough for us to be alive and live.       3. For thirteen days the family members are kept in a separate space to grief, meditate, ponder meaning of life and foresee the ultimate truth - THE SATYA SANATAN.  There are certain Kriyas of Mediation to practice which is a tantrik secret and true Nepali Blood line Family members practice this till day. When you practice the kriyas you will understand why certain vegetables and food category are banned completly as you have to go inside of you in that meditation sessions -   inside of you remains the food that you ate days before are still there inside your belly - you can literally smell the days old food that you ate - imagine the smell of the vegges from inside your belly - it smells like a gutter - eWw - hence avoiding these certain types of foods to keep belly fresh that smells good when you go inside of your own body.   3.1 om shanti practinors, vaishnav, krishna Pranamis, are stirck on their diet because of this. RadhaSwami are a bit Flexible and OSHO is freaking flexible with eating rituals. But as the one goes deep inside of themselves automatically these certain food types will be avoided by the body naturally - it is a nautral process but done with reverse engineering i.e our body naturally avoids these food when we reach a certain level of being human.   4. In the garuna purana there symbolic stories where the path of enlightenment, practices and rituals are hidden - only the Nepali bloodline families know which part of the story signifies which practices and how to do it - ask Grand Parents - not as a causal question but by paying your attention, time and showing curiousness. they might feel pity and share it with you.       5. Early morning cold showers, one meal a day have tremendous positive side on how human body functions. There are supporting evidence and practices world wide.     6. People come together at this time even travelling from far away to show social mutal respect - mareKO bela ma pani BhetNa naJane -  is a taboo. You might feel like when s/he was alive people didnot cared much - true. No One can actually care for others - Aama Ba Lai kasto xa ? Sanchai Xa ? Budho hunaBhayo -yestai ho. Sewa gara, tei ho dharma bhaneko - kinda casual talks is all we get and its okay if you see it from the other side. What else you expect other to do for you and your closed ones ? you cant when it comes to other so others cant when it comes to you as well - it goes both the ways same same.   7. Different local communities have come together in Nepal to setup a KriyaPutri House equipped with decent facilities like toilets, water supply, anti-mosqutio space, safe place to be in for 13 days. This is a good initatives.       Our generation should raise questions regarding our doubts and dissatisfaction but we should be brave enough to dig in a bit deep to understand what going on really for thousands of years ? Why did it survived for thousands of years if these rituals are just bogus - rather then skipping this phenomenon as just another short video and SWIPE ->|||Lol just don't give a sht and do whatever u want, eat whatever one and wear whatever u want or change religion. 😂 We as strangers and the law ain't judging U|||Fr esai ni manche mareko grief, teskai mathi etro tauko dukhai.

Idea is basically that this realm we witness with our senses is not all there is. Theres more to human life than constantly striving for pleasurable deeds.  Have a sense of truth.  If one develops attachment to something deeply in this material world than prepare to suffer one day. However if there is sense of detachment whilst you are part of the world than you will be able to  glide being untouched by the ups and downs of dualities.  Whole idea of cultures and traditions that we are brought up with in this  south asian central regions basically nepal and india is to instill individuals with the curiosity of truth. Whatever you do go beyond what your sense organs have to offer.  Find something that is permanent. And only truth for that matter is the answer.  And also from ayurveda perspective your digestion is tanked by sudden trauma. Just how serotonin is depleted and it controls digestion too. So you take easily digested meals.  Just a perspective.|||Some rituals of banning some vegetables is definitely stupid. But overally, minimising salt is good thing for a person to do especially stress due to lost ones raises overall bp, but obviously completely avoiding sodium isn't good. Eating fruits is also good for health. I used to think if someone close passes by, it's better to leave them some space. But it's kinda wrong as you need to surround yourselves with people this will helps lowering coristol. Obviously, people should also be supportive. One definite problem is it may be a financial burden to the family. |||Kabir Das rightly said,   जिंदा बाप कोई न पूजे, मरे बाद पूजवाए, मुट्ठी भर चावल लेके, कौवे को बाप बनाए।|||Andhabiswas le varieko desh|||I didnt quiet saw this in the comments so , everything about food restrictions is about diseases the food might carry and people visiting after death is not about paying respect to the dead person or anything , its about who remains, how they deal after the death of someone close.

Idk why this quote hit me after reading your third paragraph.|||Every ritual in the past has a reason, I am not supporting the blind follow up people do now a days. But people offer fruits as a sustenance to the affected family and remove the burden of cooking on their part. And one more reason is, our body starts decomposing within 24 hrs , if placed in a warm climate. The smell you get near a dead body is actually the body particles disposing into air. They spread everywhere, your house, utensils, every room and so on. So people are instructed to clean everything in the house as soon as possible. This also results in them not being able to use utensils at home to cook . The fruits offered are for sustenance and energy to go through the ordeal. Also most fruits are easy to digest and give good energy and fiber too.  But in modern times this doesn't make sense if a person expires in hospital or when we have food deliveries. But it is not easy to remove age old traditions at the drop of the hat because we got instant delivery. And these concerns might be valid in cities, but can we say the same regarding rural places ?|||It sounds rough but I have a theory.

First of all I'm not an expert but I can feel the necessity of doing rituals.  Simple as is said budha pakhale vaneko Mannu vancha ni as they have experienced most then us, instead of saying frustuation you could have asked about why is it necessary performing such rituals with you relatives or brahmins.  Main kura what I can feel is, if you have loved the person most who died you wouldn't have asked such foolishness. aafno lagi important manche ko lagi you cannot give 13 days, then I don't think you have loved them as you should have. Take a example if it's your partner that you love most, if needed ain't you gonna sacrifice your life for your partner?? Or you just selfish, Ill live alone and you may die?? Another important fasting reason for me is again think of it as like you broke up with your first love.. so how is it going to be for you for few days huh?? Mental problems, depression, suicidal thoughts aaucha in Esto if you really loved and you got recently separated.. so to avoid those think of this as a period that you are trying to build yourself up when the person you lived the most isn't around you anymore. You are trying to get strength from the level 0. These are just simple explanation for you to understand easily the necessity of rituals.  The main reason of rituals is something else. It goes like the Soul needs 13 days to fully leave from the earth. By performing rituals you are guiding the soul to the heaven. The fasting is not purification for you to cleanse up, it's still for the dead person.   Ani about your relatives coming bringing fruits, why. Are you mad bro?? Are you lonely your all life?? Just as you are saying it's hard for you to perform 13 days rituals how can you expect other relatives to come everyday looking up for sick dying people when every person is busy in their life.. be thankful atleast they showed up when needed..   Ewta important life lesson: janmida eklei janimye Pani manche katiko ramro thyo vanne kura mare pachi matra tha huncha.. even if you are born alone, dying alone is a really bad thing. Atleast marepachi malami Kati aayo vanda bujhnu sakincha how important that person was for all those people.

And now since people are asking for some young faces Gagan found the right time to play this move.   If you look at those people who are there in \"youth congress\" or whatever it is called who are trying to set a narrative, they are kids of aristocrats and belong to a family who are politically inclined to Congress because that party has always prioritized them and their businesses.

He had been constantly rising voice against deuba and his associates, he openly criticized NC coalition in election and he also openly said he was against forming of government with UML but majority crushed him, left high level committes of netas created during NC-UML government (indicates he strongly opposed it). firstly have to know about him. Yes he is not the best, but among the choices in NC, he is best. He also ran against Deuba in samsadiya dal inside NC and lost to him(this was just after 79 election)  Everyone says he shows himself as saviour just before election (I gave some data before), yes he should be doing now. Before Gen-z he had been doing it in slow-process but when Gen-z happened he understood his pace is not good and increased his activity. Politics is also game of numbers, before Gen-z majority were aligned to Deuba or were scared of his cartels, but why he did only after Gen-z and 20yrs after being in politics is because,  1. it is only recently when he held substantial power in NC where his voice mattered. Before he was mere MP(there ary many of them) and didn't held any major post inside NC and held just recently. If he had done before, he would have been thrown out of party and this agenda wouldn't have been carried out by anyone. He would have been the BHIM RAWAL of congress. Watch in UML what happened, when one impulse guy, without any strategies and planning went all against Oli. He was thrown out of party yes, but that voice was also changed. 2. He did this after Gen-z(not to take anything with election, if election wasn't announced, NC would have done normal convention) because it was only this time when others were also not satisfied with the Deuba. He just lead this thought of people inside congress dissatisfied and mandate he got from Gen-z that your pace is not good, do decisive, we have heard enough of you. If gen-z wouldn't have happened, everyone would have been aligned with deuba himself, and Gagan didn't had number so, he would have lost the movement and got the punishment from the Leadership. He did this (risking his political career), slowly planning, making strategies and having sense, this time he wouldn't loose. **\\[which shows he has better planning ability to get the result he wanted and this is kind of ability everyone wants is their leader\\]**  Yes, he is not best, but what happening in NC is good. Old should also get filtered. Once this old were the present RaSwaPa and they happend to be this, we need perfect Check and Balance. If NC wouldn't have did this, RaSwaPa would have got much higher seat and they would have done whatever they wanted which is wrong. We want multiple stakeholders who listen and feels the general public and NC is being transformed to that and the man leading Gagan much respect to him.  btw, for this time, my vote is for Ghanti hai (still not best, but among alternative, good than others)|||Nepal doesn’t need another PM who learns governance on the job while the bureaucracy runs circles around them. That experiment has already failed  repeatedly.  The fantasy that “outsiders are pure, insiders are dirty” is childish. Power doesn’t work that way.  You don’t dismantle a cartel by appointing someone who doesn’t even know its hierarchy. You do it by putting in charge someone who knows exactly which doors to kick, which ones to lock, and which ones to burn down.

In a multi party democracy, party is an institution just like CIAA, election comissions etc and he is actually making policy changes to choose electoral candidate more democratically.

He is a beacon of hope in this fight between inexperienced populist and the establishment with syndicate.|||People believing rabi balen and kulman are better leaders really baffles me!

He would have ended up in Jail like Rabi Lamichanne.  A real anti-corruption leader doesn’t get protection from corrupt parties, he gets attacked by them. Rabi was silenced because he shook the old parties. Rabi was forcefully jailed because of this. Gagan is fake leader & get exposed every year. He is a mastermind manipulator & a corrupt leader.  That difference alone shows who the real threat to the system was.|||He never wanted a normal adhiveshan because he would have lost to either Shekhar, Nidhi, or any Deuba-close one. A bishesh adhiveshan at the right time will make him party president for sure. Had Deuba simply conducted a normal adhiveshan this month, even after Gagan announced a bishesh adhiveshan, Gagan would have lost the party presidency election. This time, Gagan’s strategy worked.

In politics, you cannot speak whatever you like when you don't have the power to back it up. I think Gagan was also building up his influence within the Party.|||1. No one is squeaky clean- Balen, Gagan, Ravi, Harka no one.  2. There are different degrees of bad - Gagan is probably a mid, doesn’t deserve so much hatred. Of his mistakes he did cross a line against Rabi, didn’t need to and it didn’t help him in anyway bad move but it wasn’t a corrupt move.  3. we should want all parties to clean up their systems where they can- in that respect he is making the most sense.

The multiparty system, built on the premise of democracy, was far more important for the country. Although it would have taken time for the system to function effectively and for citizens to truly practice democracy, it was a necessary and valuable process.  This system was destroyed through false promises, manufactured hope, and baseless allegations. By exploiting the corruption of a few politicians at the time, and instead of educating the people, innocent citizens were dragged into a civil war. The tourism sector once a key revenue generator collapsed, while agriculture, the backbone of the nation, was severely weakened.  As a result, the country has been pushed back by decades, losing entire generations of progress. All of this traces back to a corrupt process, influenced and engineered by foreign powers to weaken and destabilize the nation, and enabled by this one man. Today, the mass departure of citizens has become a major contributor to the economy through remittances an outcome born of necessity, not progress.  Yet many people remain unaware of these realities.

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Muna, Sunkesra, and kopila defined my childhood.

He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only. Either way you two are done, if you decide to keep together one of you will need to make a huge compromise.|||Seems like you don't have any children, that's a blessing in disguise.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce. I would divorce in an instant if my husband ever did any of the above to me.|||I am married as well I do have dispute with my wife but your husband behaviour is not tolerable.

Are you just seeking the attention or Are you genuinely looking for legal guidance regarding domestic violence??   I'm asking this question because I noticed your deleted comment where you said \"He is the love of my life, I cannot do this to him\"  If you're honestly seeking any help regarding this topic, then I strongly suggest you to report this case to the nearest police station or contacting a women's commission.|||Telai bhat ma sadhai vori shutney ausadi kulai denthey ma vako vaya|||That's why I hate human being .|||I'm sorry you are going through this.   The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.

As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them.

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

            "body": "I want to share an interview experience I had today with **Avinto located in sanepa**, mainly as feedback and a caution for other candidates.  I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

OP is just complaining that he's not getting any action even after having a rare card.. so he wishes he had a normal card.. and it would solve his problems..   He just wants to be small, ~5'8 and ignored again..|||6'6\" here never got approached by any girl . Always put efforts from my side . Got a spotlight but not attraction .  The worse part is that people laugh at your back or sometimes in face , people looks  at you as if you're  alien .  Your can't get your desired cloth or shoes  . Being outlier is tough .|||6ft basic ho aaile ma 11 maii 6ft thiye|||Lmfao suru dinma ta approach garna aauxan ta hau|||Western bs mero opinion ma chai , height doesn't really matter especially Nepal ma girls already are so short I don't think they'd want 6ft guys when they are like 5'4 , 5'5 in average 😂.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

The problem of course for Mahendra was that Nepali Congress had two thirds majority in Parliament and he always believed with that much majority the monarchy itself was threatened.   I have also read some articles where it is said that Mahendra actually borrowed some of BP's policies like land reform policies among others.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose.

There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ?

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner?

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two.

He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Aren't those things hard to use? My wife tried it once and gave up.|||So I have been using a menstrual cup during the nights for the past 5-6months now, only nights cause I cannot seem to insert it at all while standing, sitting, or squatting. I have to lie down and then insert, tried all the different kinds of folds (7, three fold, rose, and everything I could find on the internet) and positions (squat, standing, sitting on the toilet seat, half squatting, one leg up), nothing worked whereas emptying chai I don't really have any issue. So I have two questions;  1. How do I make the insertion easy? Are there any tips, tricks whatsoever?   2. After using it for a period of 6-10 hours during nighttime, I cannot seem to use the cup again due to some kind of soreness.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18).

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.

That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it. Or what you think my contribution to X is. Grow up. Literally.|||Bro collecting degree like  he collecting magikarp in pokemon!|||How many degrees you got? 37?|||bro yo budo ko math 11 12 9 10 tira guide math ko ani bachelors tira ni cha   khatra budo ho hau|||And op here struggling with SEE.|||Made math easier to understand for the growing mind so that they dont post ragebait in reddit like this.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

Not worth wasting time.|||AIconf kasto thyo baru?|||I kind of get your point, but also see the value in the event. 350 for enterprise AI adoption is cheap. If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

            "body": "I completed a Bachelor of Software Engineering at Pokhara University, which I thought was similar to or equivalent to Computer Engineering. However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions. I recently tried to apply for a Technical Lieutenant (Computer Engineer) position in the Nepali Army, but they told me I needed a TU equivalence for it. This left me confused. Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering. Are there any Government Institutions in Nepal that would recognize my degree as eligible for such positions?",

In the protest you guys killed and the burned the politician and beated them on road to death. You guys destroyed public property and also the government property made by your own tax money. Stealing from malls and local shops,  those who were stealing they were all educated people, you guys are corrupt yourself and what better can we expect from government. I saw videos of Indian youths crying in pokhara for help when some group of protesters came to beat them because they were indians. Now I guess after doing all this Nepal will surpass india and germany, china, japan etc right? A politicians wife was burnt alive in her house and she died while going to the hospital.  I am not blaming the people who did nothing like this, and if you didn't then congrats 👏🏻 you hold a special place in my heart. My comment is for those who did these things not for those who didn't.  ![gif](giphy|iNPNqI81MvDQ4D4n6D)  Don't be a fool, I know truth is harsh and you can't accept it.  For some people let me clear that; I belong to a Hindu family but I am an atheist so I can see from logic, I don't support Bangladesh nor what happened in this video. But the irony of the protesters is hilarious.|||It's not muslims the problem but the hanafi, wahabism and Deubandi school of thought which makes them radical. Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess. Aba Don feri Bumble ma janxa haha  Thankyou everyone for your suggestions sabai Lai mero tarfa Bata coffee ly",

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.  I have compiled all medical records, hospital documents from Australia, and identity proofs in a transparent folder for anyone who wishes to verify our story: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8)  If you can’t donate, please share.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

These hate against gen-z we see all are boot lickers of parties(jholey's). They won't win their election since they are distributed all over Nepal in few numbers.  Now what we need to do is: 1. Make sure our parents, grandparents and relatives don't vote for these bastards again. The same thing worked for balen.  2.Never stop spamming those protests and victim videos on tik and Facebook.  3. Everyone makes sure to cast a vote themselves.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc.

And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

Well I researched myself and talked to doctor, it was because of this,  Because of being grown up in controlling nature, hamro nervous system chai ekdam arkai tarika ley build vaisakeko huncha. So, timle vaneu afno feeling vanna sakdina (same for me), it is cause maybe sano ma timle mamu baba athaba kasailai thorai gan gan (sano ma it's your feeling) uhaharule karaunu vayo athawa make you scared, then timroo nervous system chai it will build itself like it is danger to tell your feeling, ani at that time your system gets shut down (ani maan vari huney, ankha bata aanshu jharney huncha). Ani esto vaye pachi you go on talking with yourself ani most of the time you are talking yourself being angry and regret which will trigger depression. Timle real life ma ni notice garya holau, when you may have thought of reading, tetibela chai you will be getting out of your comfort zone to read where nervous system senses it as danger ani it will shut your system down ani procrastination huney type ko huncha. Ra man it is same for me.   ani for we boys(if you happened to be), everyone says taah rois vaney ta weak hoss, kta harule afno problem afai handle garney ho arulai sunauney haina, baru aruko kura sunney ani console garney ho. you may have heard this while growing up ani nervous system implants that . it will be like showing weakness is danger. Ani when your mind wants to tell but nervous system detects it as problem, it will shut your system down ani you will go in loop of regret and overthinking ani after that depression.   So, yoh problem even in me exists till now. If you can, go for professional help, sakdeinau vaney follow anurag\\_stunning in instagram. It is as effective for me as of getting paid therapy but in free of cost.|||I might help you",
