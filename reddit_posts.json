Too egotistical and self centered with no actual expertise is anything. Worsened by their inexperience and childish brashness. I fear we have lost the momentum|||He tries to give bravo vibes but isn’t smart at all. He needs to question himself: why would someone pass a bill or law or provision that directly harms them? Someone needs to teach him that in democracy, people vouch for what benefits themselves, not the other way around.  If you want to fulfill your maag, you have to win the election for ffs, and fulfill it yourself. Even the maobadi demands after armed protest were fulfilled only after they won elections and became members of parliament, not because Congress or UML fulfilled them. He needs some history lesson. Bro didn't learn anything in 3 months. The sad thing about people like him and Harka is the experts will not guide them. Experts with clean image don't want to be involved with them.|||He has done harm, but bro when they were burning down building, he mobilized the army to make sure things didn't go too far. He has helped a lot to people in need.   Yes, he has done a lot of shit, I agree. But bro is just someone who is not well-informed but tries to do his best in a world that is corrupt and pathetic. So, done more harm than good is a bit of a stretch.   If a few smart people were like him, we would have had a very different Nepal, but we don't. Cause smart people are either fking out of here or don't want to involve themselves in politics (and are planning to fk out of here). This gives the chance for corrupt racist bastards to rise through the ranks and rape the country. And yes, our country has been fked over for the last two decades by corrupt politicians.   So, yes, he is doing harm. But if he was not doing jack shit, no smart people would be out there doing any better. It would be those rapist politicians who would continue to loot and fk people over.   Better him than the old jholeys, better any young people than the old jholeys.|||Room ma sadera basne redditor le yesto sochnu normal ho bahira physically presence dekhauna ta sakdainau tme haru tara manche ko imperfections chai ramrari point out garna aauchau|||Sudan gurung navako vaye aaile samma Gen-z harulai jail kochi sakthe hijoko interview heresi jhan tha vayo keto bujhne raixa alli bolima kaile kai bichar nagarne raixa|||The summary of the interview was:  Sudan Gurung now wants to be a politician. Trying to get Balen, Ravi and Kulman to form a party so he can ride their coattail, which isn't working out so well. If the election goes ahead, he has no chance, so he is doing his best to stall the election with crazy demands until he can have a party which will lead him to election victory.  It's not stupidity, only dumb people assume people are stupid. This is perfectly rational calculation by him.|||Total clown show. Yes. This idiot has no idea of basic democracy, administration, constitution or law. He thinks one person should be allowed to amend the constitution as per the wish of a group he represents. Wtf.|||We’ve been victims of memetic warfare. The first mistake is assuming an entire generation thinks alike. On top of that, the whole Gen X/Y/Z framework is deeply American-centric and doesn’t translate to Nepal at all. Even if we try to create our own generational segmentation based on our political eras or developmental gaps, it still fails because people don’t exist in neat boxes. Socio-economic status, urban vs rural life, access to education, and lived experience all shape thinking. Yet we keep forcing lazy categories.

Development will not come through them ...it will come from either china or India. And we Nepalese will always keep on picking sides for their proxy bullshit.|||Bro rode the tide and thought he controls the sea. This is what happens when impulsive stupids gain power. Wait another 3 months he will be inciting violence on the street.|||Miraj dhungana and sudan gurung ,both guys are disappointing|||The whole Nepal political system is a clown and shit show and right now the face is Sudan. Tomorrow someone else's face will be the clown. It was a clown show before and will be a clown show in the future. Political system run by idiots with skills which are in par with con artists and scammers.   And democracy in Nepal will never work since the jantas are also bearings of the same fruit. No civil sense, no traffic sense, nepotism all the way, falano ko chinne manche jilla ko adyakcha etc, this corruption runs deep in our blood too.    In my humblest opinion democracy only works when the people themselves are self civilized and have some level of  civic sense like Europeans, Japanese, Singaporeans, Chinese etc. To lead a county and control people as uncivilized as us, we desperately need some autocratic principles with strict rules and regulation with serious consequences to those who break them or else it will never work for us Nepalese. Now im not saying we need to bring Raja as we do not want bad autocracy. We need efficient autocratic policies similar to China or Singapore.|||The protest itself was supposed to be average protest against corruption.    If people hadn't died citizens would not rise on next day.|||Yeah, he is a clown.

Doc gave me one cream called Deriva CMS to apply at night, along with another acne gel and some medicine. Doc said this Deriva CMS is the best and that it’s like an elixir. Doc said my face would never have acne after using it. Honestly, I asked doc how long I should use it. I don’t know why that doc got so mad like doc got really triggered and said, “I am giving you an elixir and still you don’t want to take it, then why are you here?” and stuff like that. I was just trying to know for how long I should be using it.doc then asked me if I knew how to use sunscreen. I said yes and told doc that we apply it using two fingers. Doc got mad again and said that TikTok skincare has made everyone go crazy, that people follow whatever they see online, and after that, doctors have to deal with the acne. Doc said in a harsh tone that we should use only a very small amount of sunscreen. I accept that I may be wrong for using sunscreen that way, but I don’t understand what was wrong with that doctor. I just wanted to know about the product doc was giving me. This time maile kei ni bhanena but next time I'll question that doctor.ek gatey ko din esto bhanera",

I came across the Government of Canada’s official travel advisory for Nepal  Almost every section talks about things we, as Nepalis, have unfortunately normalized - political instability, strikes, road safety issues, weak infrastructure, healthcare limitations, corruption risks, and lack of reliable emergency services. When a foreign government has to warn its citizens so extensively, it really makes you pause and think.  What hurts the most is that Nepal has so much potential - natural beauty, culture, hardworking people - but we’re still stuck warning visitors instead of confidently welcoming them. Many of these issues aren’t sudden disasters; they’re long-standing problems we’ve learned to live with.  As someone who loves Nepal deeply, reading this feels heavy. It’s not about blaming anyone individually, but about acknowledging where we stand and asking ourselves: How long will this remain our reality?  Curious to hear what others think - do you agree with this assessment, or do you feel it’s exaggerated?",

But people are resistant to change and they do not want to change all their utensils. Plus this might be a conspiracy but I think the gas mafia is trying to stop the implementation of induction as it will heavily impact their business.|||The electricity is still unreliable though. Batti jhyap jhyap janxa multiple times a week(where I live), so it's hard to trust availability of electricity. Also maybe the high initial purchase cost is a deterring factor.|||I use 50% induction 50% gas. Chiya boiling items everything cooks in induction, ani fry items chai gas. Hamro kati utensils chai idnuction ma chaldaina tei bhara|||Lots of nepali dont have money to buy induction.|||I have solar and battery installed here is australia.i was still using gas though.

I love induction.|||We've been using induction as primary cooking stove for over 5 years now.  The biggest hurdle for us at first was the utensils. A pressure cooker is great and works well but we couldn't get the right karai and pans for various needs.|||our cooking style suits gas better,  we use induction to boil water and some other things, but gas is still used.|||Someone broke it and now I've to hide it bed muni until i finally have courage to face my dad😭😭|||5 jana ko family lai kun sasto parcha bro?induction ki gas?  ani 2-4 stove wala lai ta quite expensive right?  gharma kura chali ra cha k garne bhanera re induction, but hamro tira batti chai gai rakcha lol|||Only downside is you have to buy different utensils for Inductions than those which work is Gas stoves and those utensils don’t come cheap|||Went to buy frying pan for induction, and was quoted 4600|||Too reliant on power, I a country where power cuts are not uncommon, I would rather rely on gas.|||90+ in the city probably..its hard to implement in rural and remote areas I guess?

You just started so others will too hopefully.|||Then the electricity bill will be double than gas price.|||Perceived costs...|||i thought use of induction was already popular after the last blockade when there was shortage of LPG.|||the electricity is expensive man|||Your question has its answer. Changing to induction means buying a new set of utensils and also changing the way you cook sometimes. Many utensils are old and passed from parents to iids. There is also this virw that food cook over electric isnt as tasty. Nepali household either don’t want to make the change and don’t want to incur more expense or don’t count on continuing electricity supply.|||Because I don't know how I always burn rice when cooking in induction|||Inductions don’t last as long as the gas stove does. We change an induction every 2-3 years, but have been using the same gas stove for don’t know how long|||Because gas is cheaper for most use cases.   A gas cylinder easily lasts multiple months for a single person and just over a month for a typical family of 4.   A typical induction would use 1000W - 2000W during a typical cooking session of 30mins to 1hr. If you're cooking more than 1 dish (rice, daal, vegetables), it'll probably use twice or thrice the amount of time and energy. If you cook twice a day, that's somewhere around 2-6 units per day costing you around Rs 1000+ per month. A gas Cylinder of ~Rs. 2000 lasts more than that.|||Induction burners require electricity, as far as I am aware, and in areas where there is a higher possibility of being without electrical power at any time, some people feel more comfortable having their heat source powered by an alternative to electricity.  For those whose living space relies on an inverter or back-up generator when the main power source is out, using induction heat sources would be less risky and more dependable.|||Because it is expensive, you don't have the flexibility of cooking however you want.the utensils which we normally use have rounded bottoms. And induction utensils are relatively expensive. Also most of Nepal doesn't have 24 hr electricity so that's there. And fire adds a taste and texture which induction never can. Induction never heats the food evenly, and food sticks to the bottom due to the nature of induction ovens. Also it takes much longer for induction to cook evenly. I have many more reasons. I have cooked in both induction and fire chulha for ages now. I absolutely hate induction.|||Batti gayo bhanne etikai huncha ajha 1 Jana ko lagi ta gas faida parcha induction bhanda 2 3 mahina tikcha|||Cause gas is still cheaper than electricity in my house.|||I had a nice GE Profile induction cooktop ($3000) that I used for about 4 years before switching back to gas.   Induction was great for getting heat quickly. Gas flames take a bit longer. However with induction once you turn off the heat the element is still hot meaning your stuff is still cooking unless you move the pan out. With gas you can just turn it off and it sits there cooling.   With gas you also have a contingency for electrical blackouts. Last year my wiring got fried and the electrician couldn't come until 10 days later. Thank God for gas so we could still cook at home.   W induction you usually need a 240v outlet. Depending on where you live this can be an expensive addition ($1300 for me).   Lastly I can reheat sel roti and papad on gas. No go on induction. Lol.",

We’re looking for a mid to senior level engineer who’s comfortable owning automation work end to end and working with minimal hand holding.  This role is project based but ongoing. There’s a steady pipeline of client work, so you’ll move from one project to the next rather than this being a one off engagement.  It’s part time with a hard cap of 10 hours per week. The current project runs for 6 weeks and pays AUD 1,500 (approx NPR 140k-150k) in total, paid weekly. And the work is fully remote as well.  The work itself is mostly backend and automation focused. You’ll be building and extending automation workflows, integrating LLMs and external APIs, and doing backend work in Python and or Node.js. Some cloud exposure is helpful, especially AWS, but this is not a pure infrastructure role.  The company is registered as an LLP in India and is based in Australia, working with Australian clients.  The interview process has three stages. First is a conversation with the Founder or Managing Director. Second is a discussion with the team. Third is a technical interview with the Technical Lead.  This suits mid to senior engineers who are comfortable working independently, making technical decisions, and are interested in automation and AI driven systems.  If you’re interested, just send me a short dm.",

You don't let the user add their own category to the uploaded images though.  I don't see how the images are contributing to calorie counting either.  Consider a simple dish - Aloo tama. Methods of preparation vary, ingredients vary, different regions prepare food differently, and different individuals prepare differently. Some might put in kimchi/ meats/ butter into that. You want your ground dataset to be verified by nutritionists (if you want to be accurate for the calorie counting part). Not asking for ancillary features (ingredients, prep method etc) is wasted opportunity if you ask me.  You could simply have an excel sheet to track contributors & a shared drive folder for uploads. Good practice to list contributors (to reach out about additional info; unless they want to opt out).  Edit: grammar|||Will you share this data publicly? ",

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Many are openly talking about revenge. If this is really about revenge for Palestine, then the world should already be finished. Germany and Japan were destroyed in World War II.

Once I caught my brother smoking after college and blackmailed him for money and hired him as assistant for months.  Then in dashain, our parents were given lot of alcohol & beers (almost half room was filled with beer & alcohol) by relatives & friends and I stole one tiny whiny bottle from there. I was drinking in my room then my brother came to my room, told me he knew I stole and can smell alcohol. He stole one for him too and we just accepted that we should both drink together that night.  For months we never talk about it or drink. Then when dad and mom went to mamaghar, he just brought some and we without questoin just sat and drank and it had been our habit to just drink beer or any alcohol he could get with money we had when parents go somewhere for the night.  Then he bought pen hukka and we both used it. We drank once every 2,3 months.  It may feel it's too easy and no brother/sister can drink this easy but how I and my brother grew up, everyone drank alcohol and it was so common thing that we didn't even felt it was that bad thing. In winter, it was out of control, we had alcohol in our home like it would last for 5 years. Mom dad, uncle, neighbors, everyone drank like it's water.",

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

It is also about emotional intimacy, vulnerability and care. It is perhaps one of the most vulnerable moment two people can share with each other.

You need to spice things up if it gets boring. |||good question, im not married but lived with my girlfriend in a foreign country for a long time   it never felt bored but the frequency of sex went from 5 times a week to once a week after a year|||Sex never feels boring.  Before marriage couples will meet outside in hotel or resort or own house once a month depending on their situation and they do it for more than 1 round based on their desire and energy. But after marriage if they are together at first they will do it daily but eventually the frequency starts decreasing ( once a week, once a month and so on based on how healthy relation is). Also different variables comes into play like desire, time, stress, problem, feelings to each other.  For someone sex might also be the ultimate weapon to mend the relation. If you are together and sex starts to feel boring then thats it, I say. In my case(not married), i go like once a month in hotel and minimum is 3 round, after that it depends.  After marriage (speculation) 2-3 times a week after 1-2 months of getting married.|||Not exactly this but far from what I have read that the frequency of sex for couples who have normal healthy long relationship typically do it for 2-3times a week   For newly married or like married for decade and so its about 4-5times a week  this is average estimation though|||Toys and all xa ta gyss , personally for me it's about my partner's pleasure than mine , so it never feels boring for me|||Sex is a two player game.

            "comments": "At 22 years, it is commendable with what you are doing. A big salute to you. I also had my struggles but did not have to support my family. At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs. Be professional at single then! You can make more from one single job.  But right now I'm also in your situation searching for day jobs.|||I just want to add one more thing…  if anyone here knows about any freelance work, side gigs, or small online jobs, I’m more than willing to take them too. Anything that can help me earn a little extra and reduce some of this pressure would honestly mean a lot.|||Find something you can release your emotions, for me it's futsal or dota. Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great. In future turn your 3 jobs to 1 and keep money consistent.|||The first thing that matters is mental peace, I know its easy to say but once you figure that out.  Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

It was so hectic that I started improving my skills and later started doing just freelancing at the end of my bachelor. And after that I havent looked back at all. All of that pressure and stress to be better and do something on my own made me who I am right now. Now, with my single month salary I could easily live upto 2 years.

One day, the 80 children went to the hostel warden and said, ‘We don’t like bread and butter. Give us something else to eat.’  The warden placed around 40–50 different food items in front of them and said, ‘Vote for the one you prefer. Whichever item gets the highest number of votes will be served to you for breakfast.’  Pizza received 6 votes, Chinese food got 15, Italian got 10, and other items received similar scattered votes. But bread and butter again received 20 votes — the highest among all.  So once again, bread and butter became the winning option, and all 100 children were served the same thing.

I could smell the toilets before even before entering the baggage claim. And the baggage claim itself, what a disaster.  I waited for nearly an hour for my luggages. And still the luggages were not there. So I had to USE the toilets of the TIA. I felt like using the toilets of the TIA was a curse. I felt nauseated just entering the toilets.  How are we saying that we are a tourism country and the first place to receive said tourists is at that sorry state?  After one and half hour of waiting, I finally got my luggages but one had it's locks broken. It still had secondary lock that was still working. But anyway, nothing works in the TIA and everything seems to work for Nepali people.  I was so angry at that time. Oh my god.",

            "comments": "Honestly, my experience in Nepal this time was quite different. I went there in July 2025 and stayed until 3rd December 2025, and apart from the Gen-Z movement in September, which was a bit chaotic but probably unavoidable, I was pleasantly surprised by how much has improved, at least in the Kathmandu Valley. I can’t really speak for other regions, but in the capital, things feel more organized and functional than I expected.Even TIA felt a lot better than I remembered. Sure, it’s not perfect, and there are still the usual frustrations, but it wasn’t the nightmare I was bracing myself for. The city itself feels like it’s slowly finding its groove, with cleaner streets, better services, and a sense that progress is actually happening.This visit actually made me feel like I could see myself moving back to Nepal permanently in my early 50s (after all, 50 is the new 30, hahahaha) and even start a business there. A bit about me: I’m 36, have been living in Canada since I was 20, I’m a Canadian PR with a medical science background, experience in telemedicine, and some AI-driven healthcare ideas I’ve been exploring. Seeing the improvements firsthand made me feel that opportunities for innovation and meaningful work are much more realistic now than I’d imagined a few years ago. All in all, while people love to rant about Nepal’s shortcomings, my experience gave me a real sense of optimism. It’s not perfect, but it’s improving, and that improvement is tangible.|||It was like that a month back when I got back to Nepal. Heard that it’s been like smelling shit for the last 3-4 months. I bet It’ll take 2-4 years and 2 arab budget allocation to “fix it”. Beautiful Nepal full of honest people.|||Heaven is myth, Nepal is real bro... Proud to be Nepali 😋|||And as soon as you come out of the airport building you are swarmed by the aggressive taxi drivers haggling to use their service 🙄|||Nepal airport is filled with pakhays and jholays—and sadly, even the management feels dominated by jholays. The infrastructure, the building itself, check-in counters, overall organisation, and especially the quality of people and their behaviour are extremely poor. People cutting lines, throwing garbage everywhere, and showing zero civic sense has become normal.  Departure is far more troublesome than arrival, which clearly shows how badly things are managed. There is also a serious lack of competent, educated leadership and balanced representation in positions of power. When merit, discipline, and accountability are missing from decision-making roles, the system naturally collapses.  As long as uneducated jholay pakhays dominate public spaces and leadership is based on loyalty rather than capability, we can’t realistically expect any meaningful change.  That’s exactly why this election matters. We must vote for the right people—qualified, educated, and accountable—because without change at the top, nothing on the ground will ever improve.|||In men's toilet, why did they installed the urinals all the way to the floor rather than bit higher?

We were okay and were like please do arrive early though, 6.30 samma pugisaknu parxa, but the thing is that mf didn't move till 10 mins ani out of desperation I just cancelled and mind you, this ride infact wasn't his first ride.   Then the harassment calls started, I didn't pick it up obv but then he used his arko sim ko number to call me raixa. Ani vakhar uthauda he started asking stuff with extremely rude tone on how I could be so shameless and stuff like that. Personally I don't like take shits from old men and started cursing him out as well, told him that I ain't his wife who takes his shits and still waits for him nothenless. He got even angrier and then started saying that u have an old dad as well. I had to tell him by saying at least my dad doesn't go out harassing girls and has low IQ like you, and isn't someone who feels anger than guilt for not doing their job. Mf started hyperviliating and had to say that ye go on and I'll report it to police ani he hanged up the call right away. Well we do have a police station near and I'll see what I can do.  But yes like I said is there nothing legal that can be done against these kinda hypocrites/ harassers in ride sharing apps?  Update: well the police there asked for his number and when they called him, he instead complained how I scolded him ulto vanera. Then they said if there's another complain of him trying to rage call customers, he will face fines accordingly. The police himself agreed that the driver was very delirious in speaking and shouldn't have had his profile in driving apps. If the driver persists a second case under his name and the number, he will be dealt according to the law vanyo. They also told ki if his offense is registered again, the complaint from the police will be filed directly to the indrive headquarters.   Indrive ma ni after he did all that, tyo hune bittikai I filed a complaint tei app ma. They did say they'll confirm with their team ani have his account disabled not confirmed whether temporary or permanent.

I’ve faced this kind of issue multiple times, and it’s always with Indrive. Pathao or Yango ma chai mostly riders are professional and on time.  Just recently, Ghar ko puja paxi euta aunty ko lagi Indrive bata bike book gareko. The rider took around 15 minutes to even show up, ani tyo pani like 5 minutes tadha from the pickup location. He kept saying “location ma chu” while clearly not being there. Obviously dhila bhayo, so I cancelled and booked Yango instead, Yango rider literally arrived in 2 minutes at the exact spot.  After that, the Indrive rider started calling and harassing. Missed calls, messages, blaming me for cancelling. I even have screenshots of the texts from one of his number  I don’t know if Indrive has zero rider screening or zero accountability, but this keeps happening. Cancellation pachi harassment chai unacceptable ho. At this point, I’m done using Indrive for bike rides.  https://preview.redd.it/nze3dpai537g1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29a4d92f665e93c16944f95823b8246613c655cc|||Drop their id and phone numbers here. Expose them.|||Go and report. The police can see call records and you can at least make him responsible for threatening you.   You are also teaching yourself to not take disrespect from anyone when you accomplish this.   However I’d suggest to refrain from getting into direct argument with the abuser for your own safety.   Even if you can’t physically walk to police call 100 and report that this person called and threatened you, and that you feel unsafe. And share both his official number and the other number from where he called.   His floor will shake quite a bit when the police rings him up. And he will never do that to anyone else again.  Once I got someone arrested for 2000 rupees, not because of the money, but because his actions were immoral and directly harmful towards others.  Another time in my house, during COVID, I heard a kotha ma basne dai started abusing alcohol and then later shouting in his room. As soon as his wife shared, shaking that he threatened to kill her that night, and that there was a weapon in the room. I couldn’t wait and see anymore. Because once we go upstairs and sleep, minimizing it as a normal household fight, he might actually do something. So I called the police and also waited outside the room until they arrived.   I explained to the police clearly how his wife explained to me in distress that he was going to kill her, and there was actually a weapon in the room. They took him away.  His wife did go to the station the next day and brought him back, but the police mediated their conflict before finalizing their agreement, which I think was a great legal support for her.   Another time, I gave a quick call to 100 and got someone out of trouble quickly. Paisa natireko vayera thunera rakheko raichha. Still they had no right to put him under house arrest. They let him go as soon as they got the call from the police. You don’t want to get arrested for kidnapping, taking control of another person’s ability to move, is the legal definition of kidnapping. So legally, these guys had no idea how deep in mud they were, when they decided to lock this guy up without his consent, regardless of the reason. That was a violation of human right, and it doesn’t matter whether someone owes someone money or not.   Learn to use the system ! Nepal ko system alikati late kaam garchha and sometimes it is not reliable tara yesto case ma police can’t refuse help when we mention we feel threatened and invoke some sort of legal expectation from the system.  For instance, the police department can be sued in district court if it didn’t respond to emergency situation, for failing to provide safety to citizens, which is a legal burden they don’t want to face publicly.  This guy abused his company’s employee privilege to find personal information about you (your phone number), then called you outside his work role, from a private number, and had Harassed you and your family.   He has no idea how much legal trouble he is under. But someone needs to report him. And you are in the perfect position to do so.|||Similar experience, they just started calling and being all personal and like trying to be weird. Just didn't pick up calls anymore. Tho i will say I'm scared still haha|||If you have better things to do than filing the case, then do.   If you find time to file a case against such people, everywhere-as they occur, and want to make a safe environment for girls, pursue the case.   If you don't have time for those, don't.   Make sure you let us know the outcome as we will want to learn about it.  Forget/ Move-on is best strategy in my view.|||[deleted]|||Do file a complaint at the service provider.

Half the time, I can’t find the type of clothes I want — and the other half, the ones I like are crazy expensive.  For example, I’ve been trying to get a nice knit quarter-zip sweater, but the prices I found (both in stores and on Instagram shops) range from Rs. 2500 to Rs. 2650, which feels kinda high. I even checked some thrift stores, but most of them are also getting pricey lately.

People don't put so much time and effort in it and only treat it as a side gig instead of main source of income. There are only handful of open mic tei. We also as an audience don't think it is worth our time and money to go to the shows or open mics.  But i wouldn't say they are lame. I have attended some events and ive choked laughing so had. The problem seem to be lack of upcoming artist. Since money is scarce in this scene, people go to tv shows like comedy club which is straight up lame with nothing but adult jokes. Most of the people big in the scenes are og and have theirr circle like aayush shrestha, zimba, apporva etc. Even they have hard time selling out shows but when some inidan comedians comes to Nepal, the same venue is packed which is double the price. It just shows lack of support. Another is people being sensitive.

Like one of the “mainstream” nepali comic literally had punchline with word “Chutiya” 😂 that’s not even a Nepali word and hence relatable at all. Having said that there are still really good sets which are viral is youtube showing good potential but most of those comics fell off.|||try listeing to allan jung thapa many good comics are really still underrated|||Ma ni khasei testo herdina Nepali Standup chai. Yeso kaile kai chai herchu. Like you said, Aayush is doing it, usko chai thikei lagcha malai. I also like Yojana Thapa Magar but I am not that big of a fan of her stand up sets. But I do find her humor really good. Like the way she posts on Instagram and she also has a YouTube channel where she makes content. And those are funny in comparison to our stand up comedies.  But yeah I think it is because since I watch a lot of Indian stand up comedy and Western ones especially Indian ones my bar is set quite high. So I think I automatically even unconsciously compare them to the stand up that I am used to watching.  But yeah stand up is quite hard in Nepal. I mean you know how easily people get arrested for making any kind of joke. I mean yes I know not every joke has to be related to any religion or caste but still people get offended over anything you know.  So there are many things that these artists need to take care of when making a stand up video. And not just that also the culture is still growing you know because there are only very few platforms where people can actually try their stand up and all. There are only a few clubs as well where they do open mic.  So being a stand up comic in Nepal is a really hard task right. So I think that is why many people also criticize it. Like I myself have not gone to any stand up comedy show in Nepal and I know many people who do not.  But again humor is subjective because the stand up comics that are in Nepal most of their shows go houseful sometimes. So that kind of proves that there is an audience for them. I have one friend as well who keeps going to these stand up shows time and again because for her she finds these stand up comics funny.  So again humor is a subjective thing. It is growing and it takes time. I guess it will grow. But yeah I mean the stand up comedy trend also started quite late in Nepal. In India the stand up comedy trend was booming while we were not even starting.  But the previous generation of stand up comedians are quite good if you look at it. I mean if you look at Manoj Gajurel and others they are quite good at stand up comedy. So the modern stand up comedians we have are still in a growing stage. And I think there is a lot of work for them to do in order to reach the masses.|||Good nepali standup comedy is not on youtube. Attend 2 - 3 open mics.

Truly incredible!  Anyway, I'm a hiker with a small youtube channel and I wanted to do the EBC to record a more popular trail for my channel.  I had heard about the trash on mount Everest but I was (maybe stupidly) very suprised about the amount of trash all over Nepal.  What's up with that? What's being done to correct it?  I wanted to hear local Nepali's opinions on this and have a discussion before I start posting anything on youtube.  This comes from a good place. I'm a nature-lover and my biggest commandments is to leave no trash anywhere I go. I don t mean any disrespect I just want to bring attention to this issue and have a productive discussion, not just show the \"glamour\" like social media always does.",

            "comments": "people really like to dump it all on the government. but the main reason is that nepalis lack civic sense. if someone sees plastic bags on the road, instead of picking them up, they throw more trash there as if they are trying to create a mini landfill. this is a serious issue, but people like to take it as a joke.   so yess i agree nepal has become a landfill and it's our fault.|||I grew up in a village in Nepal. Cleaning the house meant thoroughly cleaning the interior of the house and then dumping the dirt outdoors somewhere. We didn't use much plastic, but what we used was discarded in a \"dumping area\" in our compound. When we traveled and we had plastics and other trash, we threw them anywhere without any awareness.   Now, my family lives in a city.  There is a proper collection of garbage. House has always been clean, but now the compound is clean, too. We also don't dump crap anywhere now.   IMO, a lot of Nepal today is what we were like when we lived in our village. They dump any garbage anywhere without awareness.   It's so sad. When you travel outside the city, the sides of the highways all look like garbage dumps with random plastics lining both sides of the roads. Inside the cities (Kathmandu is the only one I have context for), you see the city administration clean very well in the morning. By the evening, you already see random plastics and discarded empty packets of foods all along the sides. It's heartbreaking to see even young children and college kids do this.   Nepal is a beautiful country, and it would be so much more pleasant if we could accelerate the awareness about dumping garbage and especially plastics and develop some civic pride in keeping our cities, villages and roads garbage free.|||Kathmandu has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth. If only we kept it clean and rejuvenated our rivers and the environment.  Everything here is so beautiful and unique from the architecture, people, cuisine and nature.   Even with the dense smog sometimes during sunsets, I find moments of utter beauty of the city and its environments that enchant me|||Thanks for calling us out. It's time Nepalis realise we are mostly similar to Indians in terms of civic sense and sanitation and moral responsibilities|||Do ittt.. post the video in YouTube and update here with the link. Title is proper clickybait-ey and the issue is real for most of the commercial trekking routes as well as cities.  Regarding who to blame or who's responsible for cleaning it up, we all are ,I guess.|||2 2s my fam! Its Trash left by trash.|||Look, I might get downvoted to hell for this. I love Nepal and the people are great! I have been there twice and am already planning to go again next April.  When I was doing the Three Passes Trek earlier in October, it was just me and my partner on the trail, no one else for miles. At some point, I decided to start collecting the trash I found. And every single piece of trash I found was most probably thrown by locals—I am saying that because it was either some local instant ramen or cigarette packs and small tobacco packs.  I spent a lot of time in Kathmandu and saw locals just letting wraps fall on the ground after they were done with their contents. In one instance, I saw someone picking up one wrap that was left on the steps of a building, looking at it and then throwing it in the same spot.  I live in the dead center of a highly developed Western city that everybody knows and most people dream to visit. My street is FILTHY every single day, but there is a power washing machine that comes and washes the street in the morning, there is also a water system that is sometimes turned on to wash all the debris that collect at the edge of the road and **every single day** without exception, a garbage truck comes and collects all the garbage bins after a guy goes into every courtyard and takes out on the sidewalk (not the residents).  When the garbage collection company workers went into strike for a month, the entire city was worse than Indian slums (I've spent a lot of time in India too). Nepal doesn't even count compared to that.  So, while I do think that the people should care more about the environment they live in, I think that it's not so much a thing of education, but the lack of a well-established system that keeps littering to a minimum day by day.  People can be educated, but a society cannot rely solely on  its people's good manners because people don't like strict rules and they will start breaking them sooner or later.  It's really hard to implement any sort of system in the remote areas, but perhaps giving incentives to locals for collecting as much trash as possible could reduce it to a minimum.  That said, we simply cannot compare Nepal to Canada in any way. Nepal is still a Third World country in 2025 and it is really hard for the entire country to simply build infrastructures from scratch and overcome a lot of issues that require huge amounts of money. Canada already has everything in place and only needs to take a really small step at a time to get better.|||I'd be angry if a whitey shits on my country. But at least for this case, I agree. We lack civic sense regarding cleanliness.|||  You shouldn't be that much concerned about the environment that you are avoiding plane trips. There's no other feasible way to travel and you alone can't do anything.  In context of pollution and littering in Nepal, it's like this in many under-developed/developing countries where littering is normal, people are slowing learning civic sense. And government isn't that much invested in proper management of this as in the west. Although, things are slowly improving with better leaders and educated, civilized people.|||Just to add a bit of context:   I'm hoping to get the opinion of Nepali with position in government or activists so I can give more information on my video.   And as a nature-lover, i'm just trying to be more hopeful.   I'd like to come back in a few years to climb more peaks but I already feel like I'm polluting taking the plane to get here and so there's know way I can feel confortable coming back and \"reward\" this amount of pollution. I truly feel disgusted with myself after my first trip.   I'm so sorry for you Nepal, I truly am.|||I grew up in Nepal but do not live there anymore. Nothing's changing anytime soon, unfortunately. It takes an immense amount of resources to keep a city clean, which Nepal just does not have (economically and socially), and will not anytime soon. It's a country of 30 million with a nominal GDP of mere 1,460 USD per capita. On top of that - the government budget was USD 330 a YEAR per person in 2021.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_government\\_budget\\_per\\_capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_government_budget_per_capita)  Imagine that's ALL THE MONEY your government spends on you! 300 bucks in a whole year! How much of a return do you realistically expect on an investment like that when it has to cover education, child/healthcare, government services, you name it. There's no return on that investment. Just to give you a sense of scale we're working on here - the government of Canada spends TWENTY THREE THOUSAND USD on ONE PERSON every year.  I'm not saying it can't be done - I'm just saying, even raising kids to \"keep a place clean\" takes a lot more than we realize; it's too far fetched to even imagine building proper infrastructure for waste management, keeping them well maintained and instilling 'civic duties' on the people.  It sucks and absolutely kills me too that it's like this. It sucks people are poor and nothing is being done to address it. It sucks that there are just bigger problems everyday people deal with.|||> Nepal is the most beautiful landfill in the world   > I don’t mean any disrespect  Ouch!! That’s not very Canadian of you. Are you sure you are from Canada?? Or may be you are from Quebec and being polite is not your thing.   Anyways appreciate your post and hope it will bring some social awareness in Nepal.|||If you think Nepal is full of trash, you should go visit India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc.|||You should do it. Perhaps then the herd that you find commenting \"most beautiful country in the world\" in any youtube video vaguely mentioning Nepal may come to realize there's a lot of soul searching to do. Everything beautiful in Nepal has been nature's boon and every corner of this country that has been touched by Nepali has been turned into a landfill site. |||Nothing's being done. It's all blame game. People know they shouldn't be littering but they just plain stupid to care. People think i'm on a fucking spectrum when i take my trash with me instead of littering. It's a mindset problem|||It’s a fairly impoverished, compact country with relatively little arable, developed land. When lots of people with few resources inhabit a small area, there are relatively few cost-effective places to dispose of refuse.  Many large US cities, where even the “poor” folks are Richie than the average Nepali, are also infested with junk and trash owing to the expense of proper disposal.|||There is an organisation working in nepal that uses drones to collect waste from everest.|||Hey there,   Im am American thats been living in Nepal for about 4 years, married to a wonderful Nepali woman, and have lived in villages a lot doing public health projects.   Theres a few things that contribute to the problem.   1. There isn't a culture of picking up after yourself or keeping your environment clean, a long time ago lower casts were designated for these kinds of positions, as that responsibility faded out there wasn't a solid push from larger government entities to replace them. So people kept doing what they always did, what their parents and grandparents did. Kids currently just watch their parents throw small trash on the ground and do the same.   2. There is ZERO propaganda coming from current or former governments that push this kind of environmental care. We have smoky the bear (forest fire prevention), the crying Native American (littering), and SO many children shows and programs at schools that help indoctrinate our populations to think about keeping our areas clean. This works incredibly well. Getting that message to our youth at SUCH an impressionable age is critical.   3. There is only trash collection in major cities and not a whole lot of  planning really goes into it. There is constant debates on dumping sites and ZERO long term planning like we have in the western world. We dig down for our dump sights and then cover them and turn them into public parks. While there seems to be a growing \"public trash can\" program, there isnt enough man power behind it to upkeep it at all.     The list can go on for sure, but these are the three Ive noticed the most.|||There is just lack of waste processing infrastructure. Basic things such as incineration plants are not available. Neither are Recycling center. Not even a good dumping site is available. Government requests everyone to sort the trash but a single vehicle collects everything. Dustbin are put on public places every few years which are stolen by locals with no impunity. Even where dustbins are not stolen and properly used, it's rarely ever collected.  And most of all, in the end most of garbage collected are dumped in rivers at the end of the day by the GOVERNMENT.   So yeah this country is Landfill.|||Idk if you’ve been to the Everest region but it’s super clean. The base camp trek is tidy with recycling of waste done and waste management plants. The bad rep is from camp 4 which is near death zone at 7000m (approx) and it’s almost impossible to clean up that area unless there is massive budget and incentives for people to risk their life to clean up the the leftover tents, cylinders etc.   You’re right about the cities being dirty though specially the big to medium ones. Terai region is also very dirty compared to rest of the country. The civic sense is low in general all over Nepal regardless|||I read it as \"\"Landlock\" and got happy for a sec.|||Canadian \"recycling\" companies were literally caught shipping the worst of their waste to Asian countries. The average Canadian sends 684 KG of trash to the landfill of which only 27% is recycled. Nepali's only generate about 81Kg per year.  So yes, we may have a trash problem and our civic sense with trash is deplorable. But that doesn't give you cause to hate on a country behind the guise of being some nature-loving anti-\"glamour\" western knight here to teach us about how this country is beautiful but...  Take your commandments to your own municipality, your own country. Countries in the pacific are going to be under water because your oil and gas money helped support your beautiful healthcare system: universal coverage, no user fees, public funding with private delivery. Truly incredible.  I don't mean any disrespect.",

You just started so others will too hopefully.|||Then the electricity bill will be double than gas price.|||Perceived costs...|||i thought use of induction was already popular after the last blockade when there was shortage of LPG.|||the electricity is expensive man|||Your question has its answer. Changing to induction means buying a new set of utensils and also changing the way you cook sometimes. Many utensils are old and passed from parents to iids. There is also this virw that food cook over electric isnt as tasty. Nepali household either don’t want to make the change and don’t want to incur more expense or don’t count on continuing electricity supply.|||Because I don't know how I always burn rice when cooking in induction|||Inductions don’t last as long as the gas stove does. We change an induction every 2-3 years, but have been using the same gas stove for don’t know how long|||Because gas is cheaper for most use cases.   A gas cylinder easily lasts multiple months for a single person and just over a month for a typical family of 4.   A typical induction would use 1000W - 2000W during a typical cooking session of 30mins to 1hr. If you're cooking more than 1 dish (rice, daal, vegetables), it'll probably use twice or thrice the amount of time and energy. If you cook twice a day, that's somewhere around 2-6 units per day costing you around Rs 1000+ per month. A gas Cylinder of ~Rs. 2000 lasts more than that.|||Induction burners require electricity, as far as I am aware, and in areas where there is a higher possibility of being without electrical power at any time, some people feel more comfortable having their heat source powered by an alternative to electricity.  For those whose living space relies on an inverter or back-up generator when the main power source is out, using induction heat sources would be less risky and more dependable.|||Because it is expensive, you don't have the flexibility of cooking however you want.the utensils which we normally use have rounded bottoms. And induction utensils are relatively expensive. Also most of Nepal doesn't have 24 hr electricity so that's there. And fire adds a taste and texture which induction never can. Induction never heats the food evenly, and food sticks to the bottom due to the nature of induction ovens. Also it takes much longer for induction to cook evenly. I have many more reasons. I have cooked in both induction and fire chulha for ages now. I absolutely hate induction.|||Batti gayo bhanne etikai huncha ajha 1 Jana ko lagi ta gas faida parcha induction bhanda 2 3 mahina tikcha|||Cause gas is still cheaper than electricity in my house.|||I had a nice GE Profile induction cooktop ($3000) that I used for about 4 years before switching back to gas.   Induction was great for getting heat quickly. Gas flames take a bit longer. However with induction once you turn off the heat the element is still hot meaning your stuff is still cooking unless you move the pan out. With gas you can just turn it off and it sits there cooling.   With gas you also have a contingency for electrical blackouts. Last year my wiring got fried and the electrician couldn't come until 10 days later. Thank God for gas so we could still cook at home.   W induction you usually need a 240v outlet. Depending on where you live this can be an expensive addition ($1300 for me).   Lastly I can reheat sel roti and papad on gas. No go on induction. Lol.",

Picked me up from airport, help me find a job a house, and gave me space to stay when things didn't work out with my friend. So basically she helped a lot. I am now working at hers and staying with her.  The job wages is really low (super low) and I dont get much hour. I earn like not even 1k. And as I'm a student so ive to pay my uni fee 1k per month, need to pay rent 500 for double room (sleeping with a 8yr old kid- her daughter) and traveling expenses etc.   And in return for stying in hers, I pay that amt, clean every corner, dishes and everything (not only mine), babysit her daughter,  teach or daughter, etc. I dont have personal space here, like if I say in shower or toilet for long she is gonna call and say where. Doing my uni hour  as soon as I am off I get call telling me to rush home to look after her daughter.  Mind you im not getting paid.   Now I got this another job right, its a night shift 5 to 3, sometime 4 to 2. Ut pays higher, includes tips which I didn't in ajnts job. Aand they also said ill have full time in my vaacation butbin my aunts job its 20 hour still in vacation. And obviously, I need to change place as well.   But like she is super angry, and not talking to me now. Even I asked if I could go on trial cause I am in desperate need of money I can't ask my parent back home, and I dont have money. She is idk.   Now can you suggest me like should I do the aunts job or move out and do the night shift one.",

So you clearly need to leave her but since you are rightly worried about possibly regretting, break down what could be your challenges. Not sure where you are based but main risk is renting on your own as unfortunately the rental market in general and landlords can be absolutely horrible although for £500, you should find a decent place.

I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Most of them were saying no vacancy and some asked to send them mail. One of them said that they will contact me later and after an hour one of them contacted me on WhatsApp with another number. They were seeking someone with TS/JS/React/Laravel but I didn't know much of these as I mostly work in Python and C++. Then without any interview, he gave me a simple task to do in React/Laravel and submit the next day and I did it. Then he didn't respond for 4 days and when I again messaged on WhatsApp and asked him, he said me to come tomorrow to their office.  I went there looking at Google Maps. In Google Maps there was an image of a building next to their basement office lol. I went there, and there was no sign, no company name, nothing. I went to that building and called that number and he came outside of the basement and waved his hand. Then he took me to the basement office.  There were like 2 rooms, one was like a small office area and in the other area there were 2 people. There were just 3 people at that time and I thought everyone was outside for lunch because it was 12:30. Then they started talking to me, within the first minutes they asked me what my salary expectation was. Then they asked me how I came here and if I had a bike or not (probably looking for overtime). Then they asked what my future plans were, if I had plans to go to a foreign country or not. Then one of the guys came and said about their product and they were apparently making some “revolutionary” POS device which he literally said “is not some normal product like others make here.”  Then another guy came and wrote something in his phone and showed it to the other guy and he agreed and then asked me to come to another room and gave me a to-do task. It was related to Laravel/React/MySQL about some session stuff. They gave me that task when they explicitly knew that I didn't know much about React/Laravel which they would monitor while I did the work and would see my level.  Then they literally said to not use too much AI. At that point, I was sure that this job was not for me. They had connected WiFi to my laptop and initially I started coding for real but at the same time they were vibe coding using Copilot to code themselves! Then I was sure it’s not for me. If I wanted I could have easily done that with any coding agent. So, I opened Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini side by side and started chatting with them telling them about my situation. And all of them said the same, “Leave now!” They gave me the task to see my skill and work but they barely looked at me the whole time. They probably looked at me 2 times the whole time.  I wanted to leave but I didn’t know how to escape. Then I suddenly shut down my laptop and then opened the bag chain silently and suddenly stood up and said, “I can’t do this, I’ll go home.” Then they said, “What happened?” Then I said, “Nothing, I just wanna go home.” and ran away. I was there for like over 1 hour. Then I went to the nearest hotel and took a cup of tea. I was laughing and smiling the whole time. So, I bought a mask to hide me smiling the whole time and walked for about 30 minutes instead of taking the bus. Then again after arriving RNAC, I went to another hotel for a cup of tea and at that time they called me thrice, once on WhatsApp, and two from different numbers and I blocked all of them.",

For the god's sake never say that again  just kidding enjoy!|||I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer. The attitude to learn and tackle problem is really good in itself. But staying on topic, over 10 years ago, in university I was taught PHP by professors, my final year project was iPhone app using Objective-C. In my first job as junior I used C#, Objective-C, JS. After I was promoted to mid soon after and I had to learn TypeScript for Angular 2 project. Then I changed job and was asked to learn React for a front end project. Since then I only had to use C# mainly which got me senior role.  So, from junior to senior I “had to” go through many languages but I made choice to master C# and SQL and not focus too much on other languages. During sprint planning I would deliberately try to pick backend tasks. That decision got me a senior backend role.  Overall I have felt the most important thing was gaining valuable knowledge of good programming patterns and principles, solid, clean code, ability to finding bottlenecks in systems, designing reliable systems, etc. are most important things that are common across any language and can be carried over whatever that maybe used. Good luck.|||It’s about breadth as well. How well do you know the language?   Can you create solutions to problems using them? For their strengths (each language has it), are you using it for the right solutions?  I had a friend who was making a blog website in rust and a server in node. He was cuckoo and said he did it for the lols but it would have been a lot better if he used the proper language for their respective purposes.|||It is not bad to learn too many languages, but it is bad if you do not know the depth of how the language ecosystem executes programs.  You are where I am at, I did projects in python, internship at JavaScript, fulltime on Typescript, Gig on Python/ Rust.  If you know TS in web domain(backend frontend) Try to dive deeper into Node.js itself, easy way would be to create a desktop software or leetcode algoeithms if you are lazy for software.  It ia a good idea to learn a language that has low abstractions, like C. It will give you insights on all other languages you have learned, data structures and algorithms as well.  My suggestion is go with a desktop app. With a low level language and you will thank your future self. If you feel stuck and progress feels like a one year old could do it better, then you are at right track.|||Not always , but to the point you should know when to use which and what balancing both pros and cons. Good luck ＼(^^)／|||First language doesn't matter much as most end up picking ones in trend or C. But tespaxi you learn as you need, so it's good to learn multiple languages if you need them, but if you don't why bother? ... You might wanna explore... different story but not helpful in terms of usefulness as you can just rest, have fun or dive deeper with what you're working already(as more you work, you come up with more tricks to get things done and those tricks make your work easier and you a better programmer).|||Yo internship kasari payu, tyo bana ta bro.|||u sound too smart for a college going boy. is that body ai generated or?|||\"Jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one\" ahh moment",

We’re looking for a mid to senior level engineer who’s comfortable owning automation work end to end and working with minimal hand holding.  This role is project based but ongoing. There’s a steady pipeline of client work, so you’ll move from one project to the next rather than this being a one off engagement.  It’s part time with a hard cap of 10 hours per week. The current project runs for 6 weeks and pays AUD 1,500 (approx NPR 140k-150k) in total, paid weekly. And the work is fully remote as well.  The work itself is mostly backend and automation focused. You’ll be building and extending automation workflows, integrating LLMs and external APIs, and doing backend work in Python and or Node.js. Some cloud exposure is helpful, especially AWS, but this is not a pure infrastructure role.  The company is registered as an LLP in India and is based in Australia, working with Australian clients.  The interview process has three stages. First is a conversation with the Founder or Managing Director. Second is a discussion with the team. Third is a technical interview with the Technical Lead.  This suits mid to senior engineers who are comfortable working independently, making technical decisions, and are interested in automation and AI driven systems.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.

            "body": "Got forced into an arranged marriage, husband is shyer than a scared kitten, and now we’re 8 months deep with zero conversations lmao.  So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

In January 2002, during the civil war, Maoists took him from his school.   They tied him to a tree and shot him dead.   During the war, Maoists killed teachers, journalists, children, and many innocent people.   When I see this picture, I always get emotional, thinking about the terror of that time and how people were killed.",

That picture is quite horrifying if you ever come across it. I found it because I came across a documentary series and it was horrific to say the least.   I didn’t realize how bad the Maoist revolution was until I watched that documentary.

That mfer Prachanda even embezzled the funds sanctioned by different organisation that was  meant for rehabilitating his own fighters.I hope  to witness his whole lineage ending up like his son, within my lifetime.|||Who took this photo|||I don't know how aware you guys are of the Badarmude bus explosion that happened in Madi, Chitwan in 2005, where the Maoist cadres had laid an ambush and detonated the bomb targeting a civilian bus carrying 120 passengers. 38 people were killed, including 3 army officers.|||I saw few videos in youtube where they were sliting captured armys neck 😭|||i've heard they ask the victim to dig a hole in the ground , and bury them till neck, so that they cannot move their hands and legs.

TLDR:- Random 60 ish y/o uncle asked me for help of busfare to get to his wife cremation at Pashupati. After i helped him he hugged me tight and that was my first ever hug in 18 years of my life.   This morning i was running late to catch bus to college, but i was stopped by a 60 ish looking uncle. And i stopped even tho i was running late, he said \"babu ma timlai yeauta kura sunauxu.....\" i thought he was one of those 'parmeshwor' ka chela and was trying to brush it off but i'm glad i listened everything.  He said that his wife died by suicide and that she drank poison. Then he continues to say, that his phone is dead (it actually was) and has no bus fare to travel to Pashupati for cremation so he asked me to help him 50rs.   Midway through i thought it was just a story to ask for money but his phone was actually dead and he was really sobbing, he even told me to keep his phone in exchange of the money.  But i didn't have any cash at that moment and only exact bus fare i needed to get to college and return. So i went to a nearby shop, bought happydent of 10rs and paid 60 from online and asked for 50 back. Which i gave it to that uncle.  He was sitting by roadside crying, while all this happened. I got to him and he got up and hugged me really tight. I hugged him back. And that was my first ever actual hug in my whole life😭 i had bad morning prior but that really lifted my mood up. I left him on busstop Then he really thanked me and fetched me goodbye while still sobbing. Made my whole day.  I really hope he's doing all okay now and may his wife rest in peace.",

No one ever loves the person they think they love. All of us love the concept of that person we think we love as it exists in our minds, not how they actually are in reality, because you can only know the person as they seem to be to you in your mind, not the person they actually are. In fact, most of us (maybe all of us), don't even know who we actually are ourselves. What we think we are, is different from who we actually are. Add to that, we keep changing continuously.  So what we loved, never existed as a person. It was just a concept in our minds.    Edit:  The person is just a physical anchor to place what one loves in one's own mind. As you have attached that concept to him, and as you know he has broken up with you, there is a mismatch and a lag which hurts. You still see that person as the physical manifestation of that love. But since you also know he is not yours now, that causes distress. Once that person fades as the physical manifestation of that sense of love, and what you love, you will no longer love him, or more precisely, the concept of him.  Sometimes the opposite happens as well. You yourself change, and what you love changes as well. But that person remains the same. This causes one to stop loving the person, or feeling love for the person, they used to love.  It is not out there. It is in your mind. |||sorry to hear that sis, breakup pain is just suffocating  How long were you guys together for before parting ways?|||![gif](giphy|sKNkMbwrgUWvogAV0I)|||I think you loved him a lot and breakup made you shocked and not to hurt yourself your brain went numb and now as reality hits you feel broken     Its same as i felt though mero case ma it was not breakup but farak thiyo   Move on gara acknowledge past aaba ke nai garna sakkinxa ra if that love was never ment to happen|||But the brighter side is you got to explore more now and meet new people.|||Khucchung Vanna man laagyo sorry|||ok|||Now be ready to mingle|||Oops !!|||![gif](giphy|W5ZUxqXT1lmiysXsDE)",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||Sooooo true!! Can confirm (Australia). I just refuse to speak hindi. My blood boils when people i don't know approach me in domineering hindi (ajha sometime ta straight punjabi or gujrati) and i am like WTFFF!!!!! And i hate when people ask me which state i am from. I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||Speak whatever the f you want and don't make it a national issue. It's a pity.|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either. Only know old ones which I was forced to watch with my mom.|||[deleted]|||[removed]|||Absolutely agree! Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason. Have been seeing this for decades now.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents. I work with Pakistanis tho and it’s the same case for them too.|||I can speak almost Indian passing Hindi (PUBG lobbies lol) but I never speak Hindi with Indians in the US.|||Yes, please stop to speak Hindi.|||I just tell them that i am from northern nepal so I don’t understand hindi, i have been working there for 1.5 yrs they have no cluee about itt|||That's why i only Speak either Nepali or English. I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||I NEVER speak Hindi and never will, I say I can understand but cannot speak Hindi so I reply in English. Don’t let these Indians think they can go around speaking Hindi to every South Asia, it’s time they learn to respect other South Asians.  Also I’m Mongolian so they think I’m Chinese or Filipino when they meet me and talk to me in English but when they find out I’m Nepali they start talking to me in Hindi out of nowhere and treat me VERY different. Hell with these Indians.|||You live in Canada. But the rest of em live in landlocked nepal who get jobs in Hindi speaking regions of india. So they speak it for the job. Like you speak english in canada|||Yep, that’s why I stopped watching, listening and speaking anything that has Hindi in it|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

            "comments": "At 22 years, it is commendable with what you are doing. A big salute to you. I also had my struggles but did not have to support my family. At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

I will add if I remember any others later.  \\- Lightweight Inventory, CRM, ROI, Campaign, Finance tracking setup using google sheets/app scripts for my non-tech side hustle which can be used easily in real-time by multiple users. It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels. At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update. Real proud of this one.  \\- Not sure this counts but I block every useless repetitive notifications for all apps on my phone unless it's a direct message. With this I get notifications only if someone wants to reach me directly. This helps with digital minimalism and to focus when needed. I allocate specific time each day to catch up on news and not do it constantly.|||I don't know about crazy and all But I am a QA and I was having trouble paying SIP installment which was a long process  So I thought to automate it and now its one click for me to pay my installment   This saves my time and also I can include in my project|||I really admire Open Source and Linux* (second home :p) and currently have two projects in the Open Source shelf:  SleekWeave Theme: https://github.com/ITx-prash/SleekWeave-Theme  Floweave: https://github.com/ITx-prash/floweave  Still much to go :)|||I'm in grade 12, and I started learning Python and machine learning.

Also contribute docs changes sometimes.  Haven't written too many scripts. I use Everdo for todos and it can sync between devices on the same network but you need to manually set the IP of the main device.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought.

I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||Sooooo true!! Can confirm (Australia). I just refuse to speak hindi. My blood boils when people i don't know approach me in domineering hindi (ajha sometime ta straight punjabi or gujrati) and i am like WTFFF!!!!! And i hate when people ask me which state i am from. I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||Speak whatever the f you want and don't make it a national issue. It's a pity.|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either. Only know old ones which I was forced to watch with my mom.|||[deleted]|||[removed]|||Absolutely agree! Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason. Have been seeing this for decades now.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents. I work with Pakistanis tho and it’s the same case for them too.|||I can speak almost Indian passing Hindi (PUBG lobbies lol) but I never speak Hindi with Indians in the US.|||Yes, please stop to speak Hindi.|||I just tell them that i am from northern nepal so I don’t understand hindi, i have been working there for 1.5 yrs they have no cluee about itt|||That's why i only Speak either Nepali or English. I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||I NEVER speak Hindi and never will, I say I can understand but cannot speak Hindi so I reply in English. Don’t let these Indians think they can go around speaking Hindi to every South Asia, it’s time they learn to respect other South Asians.  Also I’m Mongolian so they think I’m Chinese or Filipino when they meet me and talk to me in English but when they find out I’m Nepali they start talking to me in Hindi out of nowhere and treat me VERY different. Hell with these Indians.|||You live in Canada. But the rest of em live in landlocked nepal who get jobs in Hindi speaking regions of india. So they speak it for the job. Like you speak english in canada|||Yep, that’s why I stopped watching, listening and speaking anything that has Hindi in it|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.

Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself.

Think about the support and expectations your family has for you, as well as the effort you’ve put in. If you choose to return now without even knowing what you would do for a living, and considering that with your current situation you might be able to obtain Australian residency, then giving that up and going back might be the biggest mistake you ever make.

The lone life here in the UK despite having friends to roam around and party with pushed me to thinking Family is everything at the end of the day. I don't know what the future beholds ! May be ALLAH swt has good things for me ! But one thing I know is InShaAllah, I will stay here until I and my family become financially well! And then only I will return! I am into 2 and half years of that job and when I look at everything that I have done for myself and family, I am very proud and it wouldn't have been possible if I had gone back to Nepal! Alhamdullilah!|||Xittai aau hai, hami matra kina barbaad hunu, timi ni barbaad vako herum|||Dui tin barsa basdiyo chill ma, dherai aatenaa. You can certainly visit in the middle for refreshment.

It will gives you more hard times|||Hey brother, thanks for opening up and sharing all of this with us. What you’re going through is something many Nepali students in Australia and abroad can relate to — the pressure for PR, job uncertainty, and also the weight of family expectations back home. It’s a lot to deal with, mentally and emotionally.  One thing I want to say for sure: your worth is not measured only by PR or money. You’ve already shown courage by going here alone, studying, and working hard these four years. That itself is a big achievement.  About your dilemma — returning home vs. staying — there’s no right or wrong choice here. What matters is what gives you a future that feels meaningful and sustainable. If the job doesn’t feel right and the sponsorship comes with years of compromise, it’s okay to step back and rethink. And if doing something of your own in Nepal excites you more, that’s a real option too. Nepal needs young people with global perspective and courage to take risks.  Your parents will always want your happiness first. Yes, money matters — but your peace of mind matters too. Whatever decision you take, take it with confidence, not fear. And remember, success doesn’t have only one path.  Take your time, think calmly, and choose the life you truly want. You’re going to do great — whether that’s in Australia or back home. 💪🏼💛|||Life bhaneko struggle ho, australia hos ya nepal, struggle garnu nai xa bhane australia ma gara, nepal ko situation herda nepal ma struggle garere kei pauna wala chainau for now...|||Afu nai khus na bhaye k, but for your parents ma lai hatayerah ba, ma lai herah an do not return if you do not have a solid plan.|||A prime example of Hatti chiryo, Puchhar adkyo.

Poor people like us can’t afford to leave good opportunities. If you go back to Nepal especially if you are a girl, you will end up being a buhari somewhere else and lose your terms and freedom.

            "body": "I started teaching a Grade 12 girl Physics and Math from middle of Kartik. I taught her with full effort. I explained every concept, every formula, and showed her how to solve questions step by step. When I revised with her, she could answer. So I thought she was understanding the lessons.  About a week ago, she told me her school also started Physics tuition. I said it was okay and told her that I am still available if she needs help. Two days ago, I asked her mother about it again.  Then today, her mother called me and said her daughter “doesn’t understand anything I teach” and they want to stop the tuition.  I didn’t argue. I just said okay. But after that, I started thinking about everything.  The strange thing is that during class, she actually understood what I taught. She answered my questions, remembered formulas, and solved problems with me. The only problem was she almost never did the homework. Every time I asked, she said she didn’t do it or was too busy to do it. So I told her I would take a small test soon.  Now I feel like maybe she got scared or stressed because she wasn’t practicing at home. Maybe she felt pressure when I said I would take a test. Or maybe she simply wasn’t interested in studying physics with me. School tuition might have felt easier for her.  I also think the mother used the excuse “she doesn’t understand anything” because it’s easier than saying “my daughter didn’t do homework” or “she didn’t want tuition.”  Maybe my teaching style and her learning style didn’t match. Maybe she wasn’t ready for the routine and homework. I don’t know.  I just want to know if other tutors in Nepal have faced this.   Does this happen often?   Students understand during class but leave when it gets serious?   How do you deal with this kind of situation?  I’m not angry. Just a bit confused and disappointed.

Also quite concerning the poster makes no mention of the events of September 8. Min Bahadur is already putting shiny new blue panels on the Chakrapath Bhatbhateni and all his stores will be back to normal in less than a year.  90% of the stuff he sells is for credit - meaning importers and manufacturers do not get payment until the stuff is sold. In this case, all the burned goods will not be paid to the people who actually put their money to display those stuff on BBSM's shelves.  So what did Min bahadur lose? Display racks? Escalators? Billing Computers?|||Min Bahadur is involved in the Lalita Niwas scandal. The warehouse is built on government land which is acquired illegally by land mafia. Bhatbhateni has also been found guilty in fake VAT bills, evading billions in taxes. Bhatbhateni has also encroached Balkhu khola land. He also gifted 10 ropani 14 aana land in Kirtipur worth 100cr+ to UML and promised to build a party headquarters worth 50cr+. To all those people who are saying he gives employment and pays taxes, let's not forget that he is one of the biggest beneficiaries of crony capitalism. The corny capitalist and their political overlords are sleeping in the bed together to eat the country from within like termites.|||All the media seems to casually forget that this warehouse was built on Lalita niwas land.|||Oli ba lai 200 crore diye pachi kei na kei ta pauncha ni yaar  2-4 Ropani kathmandu ma na liyera huncha ta|||Warehouse?

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes. I hope that’s alright.***",

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.

Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here?

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought.

I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

But I never replied in Hindi and they just started talking to me in English after that. A lot of my co workers used to ask me can you not speak Hindi . I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too. I know Hindi, but I would never speak it unless I was physically in north India. Talk to me in my own language, or in English is my rule.

I get that we have pride, but look at the situation of our country. since i faced alot of indians too they think we are super poor. I work in a corporate, so they don't talk to me differently but yeah if i am out and someone starts to talk to me in hindi, ill ask them to speak in english. ( This usually happens in brampton area)|||I can understand this feeling. I’ve noticed something similar in myself. When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to. Then the whole conversation continues in Hindi, and afterward I feel a bit uncomfortable, wishing I had replied in English instead.       But I also hesitate because I’m not sure if they would understand me clearly in English, and I genuinely want to help. It’s something I’m still figuring out.|||I had a Mexican friend who kind of looks like South Asian and he told me that he used to get misjudged as an Indian by them and he used to hate when Indians used to come to him and stsrt talking to him in hindi thinking he's indian and he would be there just looking at them confused ... 🙃🙃.. like wtf. .. they didn't even ask him if he was Indian or not .. just because he looked like South Indian they started talking to him in Hindi ..|||Yes same!

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them.

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi.

No intricate carvings. The land surrounding the temple is also poorly planned. I just hate the metal benches. You know what type of benches I am talking about. Compare a Temple in the hill to any Gumba / Monastery and you will realize exactly what I mean.   We need to be Mandirmaxxing as a country. We need grand architecture. We need culture.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

There was also no mass campaigns raised for voter awareness etc. The outcome will most likely be the same, if the election is held again considering the amount of votes UML and congress received proportionally.

You will be amazed how popular Hitler was in Germany.|||Depends on what type of ans you want.   Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec.

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

            "heading": "I’m done with Miraj Dhungana’s nonsense. This is NOT what the Gen-Z movement stood for.",
            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.
