My problem: Most of my teachers speak a MIX of Nepali and English in the same sentence. Google Live Transcribe fails almost completely in this situation (wrong words, missing sentences, nonsense output).  This happens in real classrooms with: - Fast speech - Code-switching (Nepali + English) - Technical/engineering terms - Some background noise  I’ve tried Google Live Transcribe and system captions, but they are unusable 99% of the time for me.  I’m looking for: - Apps or software that handle mixed languages better - Either live transcription or record-then-transcribe - Android preferred, but desktop/web is also fine - Paid is OK if it actually works  If you’ve faced similar issues (especially outside English-only environments), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.

I already bought butane gas canisters in India (they were much cheaper here), and I was thinking of carrying them in my trekking backpack while traveling by train → bus → Nepal border → Pokhara → trailhead. But I’ve heard mixed things: Some people say it’s dangerous and banned Others say small canisters are okay I don’t want to get fined, have them confiscated, or cause a safety issue. So: Are butane gas cans allowed on Indian trains or buses? Are they allowed to cross the India–Nepal border? Will they be confiscated at trekking permit checkpoints in Nepal? If not, is it better to just buy fuel in Pokhara or on the trail? Would really appreciate advice from anyone who’s done ABC or similar Himalayan treks",

Are you avoiding teahouses and cooking on your own ? because majority of trek routes have tea houses where you can have your food.

I’m 25 years old and juggling two jobs: \t•\tA site sales executive job where the environment is extremely toxic \t•\tA remote social media manager job where I’m constantly disrespected and treated like I don’t matter  I hate to say it, but both jobs are draining me mentally and emotionally. I wake up every day already tired, anxious, and unmotivated. It feels like I’m just surviving, not living.  What makes it harder is my family environment, which is also very toxic. There’s no peace at home, no space to breathe, and no emotional support. I feel trapped from every direction.  I’ve been seriously thinking about leaving everything and moving to Mumbai to start over — alone, scared, but hoping for a fresh start. At the same time, I’m terrified. Quitting both jobs without a solid plan feels reckless, but staying feels like slowly killing my spirit.  The only things that still give me hope are fitness and fashion. They’re the only areas where I feel like myself again. But I don’t know how to turn that passion into a real future.  If you were in my place: \t•\tWould you walk away from both jobs? \t•\tWould you take the risk of starting over in a new city? \t•\tHow would you rebuild your life when everything feels broken?  I’m not looking for sympathy — just real, honest advice from people who’ve been here before. Thank you for reading.",

And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||I'm sorry you are going through this.   The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||ekchoti uha sanga kura garnus, kina uhale yesto garnu bhayo, k karad thyo, you have already told that he isn't that much violent ani jhagada nabhakai ded barsha bhayo bhanesi he might be going through something,      he might have thought I'm having this that difficulties, while she is having fun and such, and he might have shared his difficulties with his friends who might have said something like, why would your wife stay with you or something.          ekchoti dubai jana time milayera, cool head ka sath kura garnus, kina yesto gareko, kina hatt haleko and such.    yedi yo sab bhayena, communicate nai garna nakhojne ho bhane, usko parents wa tapai kai parents lai bhannu, yedi teti bhanda ni nabhaye chai legal procedings ma janu parla.              he might have used force and violence, in the heat or anger, so try to communicate first, ask him what he thinks, why he thinks that to cause him to raise hand against you|||You work so it seems you're independent.

That could have relegated Nepali Congress into being 3rd in the next election, and as such would probably have taken them into Maobadi like situation where they could have eventually become irrelevant.  If Gagan-Biswa take charge, I think the next upcoming election will probably pit RSP and Congress against each other as the primary challengers. With a slight possibility that Congress might even emerge as the largest party, as they have far bigger reach in the rural areas and RSP does not as much.    I do want to state though, Rabi is also the worst fucking person to lead any political party, I have never seen any political individual be so brazenly involved in so many kandai kanda. He even has multiple Kandas in USA. And honestly his sentences should be extended for jail breaking, him and RSP neta ko Karan over 15-16k prisoners fled from jail. Balen is obviously a more popular face, but Rabi has his grip on the party and I do feel like their alliance might breakdown|||yo reddit ma anti gagan propaganda failaune account haru chan yeha discuss garnu bekkar ho|||If given a second chance, he can be a good goat farmer.|||I think he is not 100 percent clean.

I have a dream that these libraries will open their doors at five o'clock in the morning, when the first light breaks over the Himalayas, and will not close them until ten o'clock at night, so that no one—no matter their circumstance, no matter their schedule—will be turned away from the pursuit of knowledge.  I have a dream that in these halls of learning, there will be proper power sockets humming with electricity, lights burning bright against ignorance, and wireless connections linking our youth not to chains of poverty, but to the infinite possibilities of the digital age.  I have a dream that the government, hand in hand with private colleges, will fill these shelves with textbooks—especially in the fields of information technology and computer science—so that the children of farmers and the children of merchants alike may grasp the tools of tomorrow.  I have a dream of a Digital Nepal—a nation transformed, a nation empowered, a nation where technology lifts every citizen toward prosperity and dignity.  Some may say this dream depends upon one leader, one name, one man. But I say to you today, my friends, that true change comes not from one person alone, but from a people united in purpose, unwavering in conviction, and relentless in their demand for justice and progress!  **Let knowledge ring from every constituency! Let learning be free!**  Only Gagan Thapa can fix this situation tbh....  tldr; please provide affordable study rooms. for NEA loksewa preparation, I am planning to prepare intensively for a month or two.

Would learning .NET be a good choice for backend development compared to Java?  Thanks in advance!",

Japanese market mostly uses Java from what ive heard.  3. Depends on the market, in Nepal both are quite established but Java more in established companies.",

Antigravity had generous limits until yesterday, github copilot is also ok. These 2 are cheaper way to use opus. Personally i use claude code.|||cursor|||If you're a student; apply for GitHub student developer pack for Copilot Pro, and also see the student plan for Google AI Pro ([https://gemini.google/students/](https://gemini.google/students/)), and use AntiGravity IDE (it's a vscode fork by google so migrating is no pain, it is more than enough for daily coding, each models including Gemini 3, Claude Opus/Sonnet etc refresh in 5 hours, you barely hit the limit).  About models, I have coded on simple to fairly complex codebases, here's my ranking:  1. Claude Opus 4.5 2. Gemini 3 Pro High 3. Claude Sonnet 4.5  If it's a normal quick edit and you know what you're doing, use non-thinking fast models like Gemini 3 flash, otherwise for complex tasks Claude is the clear winner.  Running a model locally is not worth it unless you have a really good GPU, and you can setup search + MCP server yourself (I don't recommend tbh). I know how to code, but I'm pretty much in the backseat now telling my IDE how to do what things.  Edit: Google also has gemini-cli, and it is also really good, also has free tier for everyone. And, look at this: [even linus appreciated AntiGravity recently.](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1q9wdru/linus_vibecoded_and_claimed_antigravity_did_a/) What other reasons do you need now? xD|||Antigravity is cool and works with multiple models.  hallucination also depends on your input, if the input is vague, LLMs are people please doing everything and anything thats not required so always be very specific with commands|||If you want Claude, github, you can contact me.|||Sab eutai ho|||I spun up my portfolio website in a day using antigravity. Super impressed by the generous limits. Plus the IDE itself is super amazing. Unlimited autocompletes.   I suggest trying out antigravity|||claude|||For what it’s worth, I switched from relying on GPT to using **Claude Code** for my coding stuff and it’s been way better with logic and debugging; feels like it actually *gets* the context most of the time. I pair that with [GLM 4.7](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=J1YSHA0WA2) for quick runs; it’s strong like Sonnet but ridiculously cheap (like a few bucks a month). Totally worth it if you want less hallucination and a setup that feels like part of your workflow rather than fighting it. My IDE hooks into Claude Code via the CLI and then I hit up the GLM for fast drafts before refining.",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

            "body": "We should not forget the 13 years of his tenure as a lawmaker.  We should also not forget the moments when BP’s core principles and the rule of law were conveniently sidelined. On one hand, he repeatedly argues that the primary duty of a lawmaker is to make policies. On the other, he aggressively lobbies for large budget allocations for Kathmandu-4, especially during annual budget announcements. This contradiction cannot be ignored. You cannot preach institutional discipline while practicing constituency populism.  Let us also be honest about his selective silence and political collusion. On multiple occasions, he aligned with the UML-yet raised no serious questions then. Silence prevailed. Now suddenly, everything is being framed as if it was unknown, accidental, or forced.  When he claimed that he learned about the UML-Congress coalition through newspapers, did anyone truly believe that?  He is the General Secretary of a major political party. If information can reach newsrooms overnight and be published the next morning, are we seriously expected to believe it did not reach him in that time?  Yes, advocating reform within the Nepali Congress is a positive step.Yes, the health insurance scheme he supported has helped millions of Nepalis, and that contribution deserves acknowledgment.  But one policy success does not erase a largely failed tenure. Especially when there was no meaningful challenge to corruption allegations against Sher Bahadur Deuba or other senior Congress leaders. When accountability was needed, silence prevailed. And now, after years of inaction, power is suddenly being demanded.  At a time when Nepali politics desperately needs fundamental reform-“one person, one role”-he seeks to contest both party president and Prime Minister.

Roads without industries don’t create opportunity; they just make it easier for people to leave the country. राम्रो सडकले विदेश जान सजिलो बनाउँछ, देशमै काम गर्न होइन। Development is not about viral posts, symbolism, or “देखाउने काम.” It’s about building systems that actually generate employment and sustainable growth. Without a clear industrial roadmap—कुन क्षेत्रमा लगानी गर्ने, कसरी रोजगारी सिर्जना गर्ने—road-building becomes nothing more than cosmetic development. माथि चम्किलो, भित्र खोक्रो। A nation doesn’t rise on concrete alone; it rises on production, skills, and jobs.

The multiparty system, built on the premise of democracy, was far more important for the country. Although it would have taken time for the system to function effectively and for citizens to truly practice democracy, it was a necessary and valuable process.  This system was destroyed through false promises, manufactured hope, and baseless allegations. By exploiting the corruption of a few politicians at the time, and instead of educating the people, innocent citizens were dragged into a civil war. The tourism sector once a key revenue generator collapsed, while agriculture, the backbone of the nation, was severely weakened.  As a result, the country has been pushed back by decades, losing entire generations of progress. All of this traces back to a corrupt process, influenced and engineered by foreign powers to weaken and destabilize the nation, and enabled by this one man. Today, the mass departure of citizens has become a major contributor to the economy through remittances an outcome born of necessity, not progress.  Yet many people remain unaware of these realities. One cannot help but wonder: when will people finally grow up and confront the truth?

I’m 25 years old and juggling two jobs: \t• A site sales executive job where the environment is extremely toxic \t• A remote social media manager job where I’m constantly disrespected and treated like I don’t matter  I hate to say it, but both jobs are draining me mentally and emotionally. I wake up every day already tired, anxious, and unmotivated. It feels like I’m just surviving, not living.  What makes it harder is my family environment, which is also very toxic. There’s no peace at home, no space to breathe, and no emotional support. I feel trapped from every direction.  I’ve been seriously thinking about leaving everything and moving to Mumbai to start over — alone, scared, but hoping for a fresh start. At the same time, I’m terrified. Quitting both jobs without a solid plan feels reckless, but staying feels like slowly killing my spirit.  The only things that still give me hope are fitness and fashion. They’re the only areas where I feel like myself again. But I don’t know how to turn that passion into a real future.  If you were in my place: \t• Would you walk away from both jobs? \t• Would you take the risk of starting over in a new city? \t• How would you rebuild your life when everything feels broken?  I’m not looking for sympathy — just real, honest advice from people who’ve been here before. Thank you for reading.",

And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc).

Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.  Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

Get support from the help available around you.|||Take care sleep well !! You know what to do but you aren’t acting you might have reasons !!

Relationship ma respect nai chaina bhane ta jati maya jataye pani will never cut it.|||where do you live OP?|||This is an escalating behaviour. He has no regards for consequences. Next time he might do something even more severe. And at that moment, His response would be something along the lines of the heat of the moment.  You do not deserve to be treated this way, no matter what the reason maybe.    I would suggest to take drastic measures given out by some concerned redditors. Distance yourself from him either by involving & going to your parents home and discussing the plan moving forward or if that is not possible to the authorities.   Your safety is of utmost priority。|||Yea, you should have reported him long ago. Not the man you need to have in your life.Please please report  before its too late|||Keep evidences of his violence towards you (like photos of any bruise wounds he might’ve inflicted in your body), contact someone close to you and make them a third party witness to your situation.|||most probably, he is cheating. better check him instead|||If not for you divorce him for your kids. Even if you don't have them now it will be harder when kid is involved.    If you keep this going your kid will someday blame you too, if not entirely. Because for a kid when they come to world first environment they grow up will be normality and every time your husband gets mad at you, for the kid it will be your fault. That day you will look back and think where you went wrong.   The more you wait the more it gets worse.|||Once a beater, always a beater. File a case didi. Let him rot in a bidesh ko jail.

You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only.

Are you just seeking the attention or Are you genuinely looking for legal guidance regarding domestic violence??   I'm asking this question because I noticed your deleted comment where you said \"He is the love of my life, I cannot do this to him\"  If you're honestly seeking any help regarding this topic, then I strongly suggest you to report this case to the nearest police station or contacting a women's commission.|||Kun country khulaunu bhayena tara most of the abroad countries ma domestic violence lai ekdam seriously linchan.

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||I'm sorry you are going through this.   The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||ekchoti uha sanga kura garnus, kina uhale yesto garnu bhayo, k karad thyo, you have already told that he isn't that much violent ani jhagada nabhakai ded barsha bhayo bhanesi he might be going through something,      he might have thought I'm having this that difficulties, while she is having fun and such, and he might have shared his difficulties with his friends who might have said something like, why would your wife stay with you or something.          ekchoti dubai jana time milayera, cool head ka sath kura garnus, kina yesto gareko, kina hatt haleko and such.    yedi yo sab bhayena, communicate nai garna nakhojne ho bhane, usko parents wa tapai kai parents lai bhannu, yedi teti bhanda ni nabhaye chai legal procedings ma janu parla.              he might have used force and violence, in the heat or anger, so try to communicate first, ask him what he thinks, why he thinks that to cause him to raise hand against you|||You work so it seems you're independent.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce. I would divorce in an instant if my husband ever did any of the above to me.|||Leave before its too late|||I am married as well I do have dispute with my wife but your husband behaviour is not tolerable. No matter what at the end I am always the one that go to my wife and say sorry and I have never hit her. If you keep quite than that will be your fault as well so speak up to someone or report the incident. You are not in nepal and yes we live abroad as well.|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai. Sano step agadi badhdai lanu, talk to mum atleast or best friend.

Even watching movies or playing outside would make her angry and this behavior worsened when i was a teenager. As a teenager, I wasn’t rebellious. I just shut down. I’d lie in bed, stare at the ceiling, pretend to study, and feel quietly depressed instead of doing what I wanted.  Now as an adult, I feel disconnected from people. Relationships feel shallow, conversations don’t go beyond “hi, how are you,” and I don’t really want to leave the house. I know I can’t blame my childhood forever, but I feel stuck in this loop and don’t know how to break out of it.",

As I grew older I started to accept that it is completely okay and even necessary to do the things I enjoy and love and just hang out with the people I like, and that I don't have to try so hard to fit in. Only by pursuing what I myself wanted to do (and not getting involved in things I didn't really) did I start feeling like my authentic self, who I had kept suppressed inside me. It helped that I'm abroad now and also seeing a therapist occasionally to talk through such trauma.  Push yourself to do the things you want and don't judge yourself so harshly. You aren't going to vibe with everyone but treasure those who like you (or will come to like you) as you are|||[deleted]|||😭😭😭  please learn to rebel, a little drama in the family is okay|||Maximum medium class nepaliko story ho.

That is a natural progression to what you’re feeling. You did not grow in a social environment, of course it won’t feel natural to socialise.   On one hand you will begin to improve in socialising if you keep doing it and also realise that socialising is a two way street. On the other hand, what you learned in your childhood will stick with you for a long time. You will always be hyperaware of your surroundings. Specially the people.   Don’t forget to realise a few facts every once a while. This is the loneliest generation there’s ever been. Everybody is afraid to make the first move. We didn’t deserve to be burdened with the pile of shit they received from someone else but such is life. Let’s get on with it. If you need someone to talk to, you can send me a message, take care now. ✌🏼|||Same here but I'm yet not adult, I don't feel like confronting someone or make a deal of sth even when it needs to be done.  I don't let myself be trampled on but argument drains me . I don't ask anything and I don't even dare to become angry with my elders ..even though I feel resentment. 😭|||I felt this man, the relatives visiting and mom getting moody is so real. I had the exact same environment and I'm just starting to see how it's so deeply rooted in me now in my early twenties. I can't voice my feelings out or express what I want without feeling like my throat is tied with barbed wires bro.  Everytime I try and speak my emotions or feelings, even basic ones that don't seem like much to other people, I start getting tears in my eyes and I automatically shut down. Can't get a word of my opinion out. Don't even get me started on fights, misunderstandings and disagreements. They feel like hell to me even though I know it's nothing big.  It might feel like there's nothing you can do about it but trust me, it will go away even if it takes a lot of sacrificing your comfort zones. Don't cancel plans when your friends ask to hangout, start letting them in your heart, relationships require sacrifices too, you gotta do things that you don't really wanna do and instead just sit in your room alone. Get out of this loop, go for a short hangout with people that you feel comfortable with, start investing in friendships and I'm sure it's gonna start feeling better.  There's times where I feel like I'd be better off alone in this world, I don't need people at all, and that friends are just intervening my life. That happens so often. You don't need to push these feelings away, let it come but then let it go. Humans do need people after all. So please get out and make changes, even if you have to fake it. It will get you going.  Also the most important part, let your parents be disappointed, as controversial as this may sound, that's the only way you can brace your heart and start doing what you want. Parents do get worried and that's valid but as a saying goes \"ships are safe in the harbor but ships are made to sail\", yes you are comfortable and safe and away from your parents nagging in that room, but how long will you let that keep you lonely?|||You have my sympathy.|||It's same for rebel too.....I'm very rebellious but the amount of energy u drain is crazy.......so to restore it I stay back at home most of the time..........|||Rebelling is the key  I just entered adulthood, and I rebel a lot and eventually they'll give up (hopefully)|||Just believe in ‘teleology’ instead of ‘aetiology’.

The few times I hung out with Nepalis I realized they're basically living in Nepal with Nepali mentality while abroad. Many had moved abroad and lived there for decades but were still unaware of many Western customs-they just didn't assimilate into the culture. I could see how much they missed out on. I just didn't want to be in that situation. So, you're right, because as many others have mentioned, immigrants don't get out of their comfort zone, they miss out on a lot.

For most young people: -   Most Nepali come here to work on a student visa, not for study. They enroll in a cheap college which is mostly populated with Nepali or foreigners from south asian countries.   Then, they need to find work, since they can’t work more than 20 hours legally, they need to find work in cash, so they need to network with Nepali people who work in cash to bypass the work hour requirements.   Then, they need to find a cheap place to stay. Probably 2-4 people crammed in a single room sleeping in bunk beds. Guess who is willing to do that ? Other Nepali or south asians.   For married couples :  They don’t live in crammed rooms but navigating lives and work pressures help them better relate with eachother than foreigners of that land.  ——————————  It is not a nepali trait or south asian trait. It is a socio-economic trait.   Nepali students who actually can afford their tuition without working illegally having a partner just to make ends meet live a completely different life.   They have the luxury to go out after college to socialize, visit new places with friends, participate in clubs and events. Become members of universities bodies, a representative or host in Universities, and many other involvement where they make connections with people of all backgrounds. They explore leadership opportunities and develop their social skills.  All this while most Nepali students don’t have enough time to sleep cus they have to earn, pay for tuition and send money back home. God bless them, they are so tough. I could have never been able to do that.   ———————  I was lucky enough not to worry about money and my tuition. So i had a lot of free time. There was a point where I knew almost everyone in my Uni ( literally speaking ) and i used to host weekly events in uni. I have got friends from all over the globe. I knew just 2 nepali people from my uni, just 2 ( one was a girl i dated, if i wasn’t dating her, I don’t think we would have spent any time together ). I tried to find more but i never bumped into nepali people in any in places i found myself in.   Not a single Nepali person besides me, in my entire college degree, across all courses. Not a single Nepali person in any events I attended. I was the only Nepali in the first two jobs i did.   Unless i went to nepali events, i was not around Nepali people. I go to Nepali events just to meet Nepali people so i can make more Nepali friends because almost none of my friends are Nepali.   ———————  So yeah, there are some language and cultural barriers but these are insignificant.

I have a handful of non-Nepali friends whom I truly value and enjoy. It’s not that I don’t want Nepali friends but I simply don’t have many Nepali people around me that are my age to regularly hang out with (Nepali population that I have seen around me are either they are college students way too younger or way too older with kids).

How many close friends did we truly have from so called lower castes not just as acquaintances but as people we regularly hung out with, defended, and learned from? How many of us who ask this question actually learned Maithili, Bhojpuri, Newari, Tamang, Gurung, or Tharu by choice and not because we had to?  If we did not assimilate in a country as diverse as Nepal, why do we expect people to suddenly become global citizens the moment they cross a border?  Isn’t it human nature to seek familiarity when everything else language, culture, food, accent is unfamiliar? When someone is already navigating visas, racism, homesickness, and identity struggles, is it really surprising that they hold on to the one space where they do not have to explain themselves?  And when Nepalis abroad spend time with other Nepalis, is it exclusion or survival? Is posting vlogs and photos with familiar faces a rejection of the world or simply documenting comfort? Do we ask the same questions about Italians Chinese or Mexicans abroad or do we reserve this criticism only for Nepalis?  Maybe the real question is not why they do not explore but why we romanticize exploration abroad while ignoring the lack of it at home.  If we could not fully embrace diversity in Nepal a country with dozens of languages countless cultures and everyday diversity, what makes us think a plane ticket alone changes that?|||1) Just because you want to hang out with them doesn’t necessarily mean they also wanna do the same. Lot of White colored people do want to hangout with other white people only. Lot of white people only want to date white people. It doesn’t have to be racism and could just be of choice. Whats happening in the US today isn’t happening because of 1 person disliking non white population, there are many as such. So yea, for 1 they also do not like to hangout with non white people so thats kinda why Nepali are seen hanging out with their own.  2) Its also not very easy to hangout with different cultures. The reason nepali people gets along with Indians is due to commonality between our culture the way we are brought up. That just makes it easy to communicate and of course functions and religion bring us together. Sometimes our upbringing makes it so difficult to hangout with white culture. Something Thats very basic or normal to us might be offending to them.   These are some basic reasons why nepali are seen hanging out with other nepali or just desi community. Even our struggles are similar, so it’s out of convenience and commonalities.|||Why do Nepali people abroad only eat Nepali food?? There are so many better options|||I avoid Nepalis like the plague",

As someone who geeks out over linguistics, I realized I was seeing something I’d never personally witnessed before: the involvement of local, non-mainstream languages in election campaigning.  ​Usually, everything is in the \"official\" or dominant language, but this time I saw posters featuring Newar (Nepal Bhasa), Urdu, and Tibetan.  ​I’ll admit my ignorance—as a non-Newar, I had never actually seen the Newar language in written form used to promote an election before. Seeing it alongside Urdu and Tibetan makes me so curious about the selection process.  ​Is this a sign of campaigns moving toward hyper-local inclusivity? Or is it a tactical move to reach specific \"pockets\" of voters that have been traditionally overlooked? I’m particularly interested in:  ​The Newar script: It’s such a powerful cultural statement to see it in a public, political space.  ​The Urdu/Tibetan choice: These feel like very specific demographic \"nods.\" Is this happening more frequently in certain districts?  ​I’d love to hear from anyone who lives in these areas or knows more about the political strategy behind this. Is this a new trend for the upcoming 2026 elections, or have I just been blind to it until now?",

He was against the idea of nepali congress joining the coalition multiple times but deuba had the majority and made decisions. Now everyone's seeing whats been going on Congress since forever.  Why deuba and his close ones are trying their best to hang in power? If they lose the grip, Arzu deuba , PS Mahat , Nidhi, Prakash Man Singh all their political career is gone and high chances they'll be behind bars. On the other hand, Gagan thapa finally got some sort of NC constitutional validation in form of special convention (thanks to gen Z protest) , he's on attack mode.

Case 2: Deuba and old parties are instructed to hold on to power by India and China.  Why?- Lets look in Europe. Lookup Victoria Nuland: she is high level US diplomat (probably retired now)believed to be the mastermind behind election of Zelensky in Ukraine and probably pushing for the war (there are leaked audio clips too probably available in internet.).  A coincidence that she happened to have visited Nepal and Bangladesh in 2023.   A coincidence that most of the emerging Gen-Z leaders happen to have ties to US and Europe supported leadership programs. For instance Rakshya Bam was part of it back in 2021-22 or something like that. Let us not forget that that Late King Birendra was killed in one of the most secured places in Nepal. Something about police shooting young people all of sudden doesn’t make sense at all.   A coincidence that she is closely linked with Gagan Thapa who coincidently happens to have the biggest voice for MCC and has close ties with US embassy. Could be a ploy to weaken existing parties to bring RSP to power. With RSP in power you get a government and youngsters who grew up hating neighbours (india and china-probably china not as much)which can now be easily manipulated and controlled.  Why again? India and China are aligning with Russia and in process of formation of alliance to stand up against US. Lookup BRICS. Not to forget their rise and rising dominance in global trade while US is sinking in debt.  Nepal, bangladesh, pakistan are going to be nerves which US and Europe would like to press every now and then to pressure India and China.   Could it be that Nepal is just a battleground for war being fought somewhere else? Very likely.   I would not be surprised if Nepal turns into a battleground in next 5-10 years, where madesh, free Tibet and gorkhaland issues start to resurface.  Interesting and dark times could be ahead. Probably not the best times to godify western taught youth leaders to align and take command of Nepal. Tada ko deuta vanda najik ko bhoot thik. Probably need organic nepali politicians to lead. Best case scenario for Nepal could be the return of king or have pro-china or pro-india gov. Gagan is probably not the best person. Possibly why Deuba could be backed by India and KP and PKD by china.  Chances are there are bigger things at play. See what happens.",

The most christian part of the school is that they can provide catechism classes to some Christian students if they want it and they have mass or smthing (i was never went/had to go).   I'm an atheist and grew up in a Buddhist family so i can say that much. Other than that, the school is pretty good, not as modern as other schools since the fee is def at the lower end of the spectrum for good schools. The school campus is nice but the classrooms are meh at best. They have pretty nice clubs and has the whole traditional english house system like in hogwarts with a head girl/boy situation.

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions. I recently tried to apply for a Technical Lieutenant (Computer Engineer) position in the Nepali Army, but they told me I needed a TU equivalence for it. This left me confused. Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering. Are there any Government Institutions in Nepal that would recognize my degree as eligible for such positions?",

As a final-year CSIT student, I didn't have a corporate budget, so I had to be strategic with free and low-cost resources.  I see a lot of people asking if 1 month is enough. It is, but I studied **6 hours a day** strictly. Here is exactly how I did it.  **The Timeline (30 Days)**  * **Days 1-12:** Watched the FreeCodeCamp AWS course (Andrew Brown) on YouTube. I didn't just watch; I took notes on *everything*. * **Days 13-20:** Deep dive into **Tutorials Dojo Cheatsheets**. This was a lifesaver for confusing topics like VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway. * **Days 21-29:** The Grind. I used **ExamPrepper** and went through **1,019 practice questions**. * **Day 30:** Rest & Light review.  **The Resources:**  1. **FreeCodeCamp (YouTube):** Best free resource to understand the basics. 2. **Tutorials Dojo (Cheatsheets):** Mandatory for understanding the small differences between services. 3. **ExamPrepper:** I did 1,000+ questions. This helped me build speed and learn to spot \"distractor\" answers.  **Exam Experience:** The questions were wordy. Managing time was harder than I thought. Because I practiced so many questions beforehand, I could quickly identify keywords (e.g., \"highly available\" vs \"cost-optimized\").  Happy to answer any questions about the exam or my schedule!",

It can't sustain without a critical number of riders and customers. So they need to have at least a critical number of both sides in each location.eg.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Renu has made a name for herself in Bharatpur but this will be an election for parliament and not mayor. Last election chitwan had a rabi effect where people in other constituencies voted for him because he was contesting from chitwan and his influence was so immense even the constituency in the neighbouring district were effected. Nawalpur which was considered a stronghold of NC nearly lost to RSP in 2079. Also, chitwan - 3 was won by RPP and previously by prachanda. Even though renu had influence in the constituency, they did not risk prachanda. After what happened in sept 23/24, i don't think people are going to vote for individual and would rather vote for a party other than the big 3. Expect to see rabi campaigning aggressively in chitwan -3 than chitwan - 2|||from being chitwan 3 I see it very unlikely Renu would lose this election. Despite she being Prachanda's daughter, she has made a name for herself as a mayor here. If Rabi was going against her, then this would've been a tight competition imo. Yes, ghanti gang do be making noise in chitwan but deep down we all know Renu has brought visible and tangible change on the ground level. I do not support the way she won her last election (a can of worms there) but I do have to acknowledge the work she has done.|||Renu will not lose in Chitwan immovable object|||Media trial, if she runs from chitwan -3, rsp is sacrificing such a gem.

She has done wonders for bharatpur people|||Bikram Pandey laughing from Chitwan 3|||Haha balen lai Mayor re party ko upa sabhapti bhnnera kina nabhneko hol|||RSP can sweep chitwan 3. First, rsp has a good base there. Second, Renu has done some works, but more manipulation of media people and influencers to brand her as developmentalist. She has been surrounded by few controversies. One example: dumping of waste in narayani river. Third, prachanda ran away from chitwan-3 last election thinking ravi will contest from chitwan-3. Ravi´s craze is even more now with balen and kulman joining rsp. A strong rsp candidate can be victorious. Fourth, there is a decline in craze of uml and congress among under 35 people of chitwan. I myself interacted with few people from different wards of bharatpur and madi and barring few, all said they won`t vote for big 3 and bikram pandey and are looking for new political force.  P.S.- Personally, I do not think shobita will contest from chitwan -3 against renu. Her businessman husband is super close with prachanda and even shobita has become close with prachanda due to family matters. Plus she won kathmandu-2 last time just because of ravi craze at that moment. Not even 500 people from kathmandu-2 heard about her before. She is indeed a good orator and law student. i have known her since AYON days when she lost a election in ayon. Besides good oration in parliament, she has literally not done anything for kathmandu -2. ( You can ask any voter of kathmandu 2, like tinkune, sinamangal area, pepsocola what she has done for kathmandu-2 ) I hope rsp will bring some local candidate from chitwan with clean image. If rsp brings shobita, she will definitely cut vote of other candidates and any unpredictable result can come. She can grab good votes, but not enough to win the election.   - And i m not Rsp member or fan, just a curious youth following nepali politics 😀|||Balen mulla KP oli ko against ma uthne bhanera ufrirathiyo ta",

I remember a similar situation involving one of my friends. At the time, he was married and had a child, and there was a significant age difference between him and a relative of his wife who was living with them. One evening, during a casual conversation, my friend shared that over time he noticed the person trying to become emotionally closer to him. He said that although he initially had no such intentions, she later expressed a desire for a secret relationship, emphasising that it was not about emotions or commitment.|||Xya kasto disgusting..man ta man vayi halyo (not excuse but ghero se kya umeed) Tara afnei buini testi??

The husband has PR, and if their kid has an Australian birth certificate.. I'm sure the mother can apply for child support or alimony of any sort.

Don’t treat us with respect we leave and find someone better. That’s just the way it is.   If she had treated him better, he would not have gotten close to her sister. It just shows that she is a toxic person that doesn’t care for that man. Not talking for 1-2 months over a small argument is just not it. Especially after pregnancy (meaning he’s not getting laid). A man has needs. Intimacy and Respect.  Good on him for finding someone better when he didn’t get what he want from his partner. It’s good to leave people who don’t talk to you for 1-2 months after a spat and can’t find it within themselves to apologize.",

Shady past in U.S. (Active court cases) 2 Sahakari Case ( there are people - common people that are affected by his misadventure at the end of day) 3. Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker. We will find fault even if we get Gautam Buddha today, but still I hope whoever comes top do good for our nation.|||Ghante Thag ko support garne bhayera|||Propaganda to divide nation and people , need raaaja asaap , every political party are puesonof any type of foreign power , let's go for blind raaaja aau desh bachaau|||Due to formal Ravi's cooperative, citizenship issues ???|||Cause he is not baun or chhetri, this sub makes you hate anyone who is not baun or chhetri|||Didn't knew he was so power hungry. 😬|||Kulman for PM|||Ahh, I wasn't wrong.

I have been in countless verbal altercations ranging from while woking in biggest supermarket to kitchen to working at a trade. Letting them bully you gives them energy,  I always stand on business when I know I am right and instead of saying nothing, I make sure my higher up knows and the said bully knows I don’t appreciate their approach towards me. I am very respectful of people around me and their space but when I crash out, they know that shit is up. I have had managers having my back and backup managers shaking visibly and unable to come to work the next day when I confront them. Most importantly, I am not worried about keeping my job while enduring someone’s whim when I just want to finish my tasks and head off.|||The Nepali society ko thought of people cant hit women because they’re women is so freaking wrong.

I told her its definitely bad to be hitting children or old people, but her being a woman isnt an excuse. Anyways drop the names here bud.

He had been constantly rising voice against deuba and his associates, he openly criticized NC coalition in election and he also openly said he was against forming of government with UML but majority crushed him, left high level committes of netas created during NC-UML government (indicates he strongly opposed it). firstly have to know about him. Yes he is not the best, but among the choices in NC, he is best. He also ran against Deuba in samsadiya dal inside NC and lost to him(this was just after 79 election)  Everyone says he shows himself as saviour just before election (I gave some data before), yes he should be doing now. Before Gen-z he had been doing it in slow-process but when Gen-z happened he understood his pace is not good and increased his activity. Politics is also game of numbers, before Gen-z majority were aligned to Deuba or were scared of his cartels, but why he did only after Gen-z and 20yrs after being in politics is because,  1. it is only recently when he held substantial power in NC where his voice mattered. Before he was mere MP(there ary many of them) and didn't held any major post inside NC and held just recently. If he had done before, he would have been thrown out of party and this agenda wouldn't have been carried out by anyone. He would have been the BHIM RAWAL of congress. Watch in UML what happened, when one impulse guy, without any strategies and planning went all against Oli. He was thrown out of party yes, but that voice was also changed. 2. He did this after Gen-z(not to take anything with election, if election wasn't announced, NC would have done normal convention) because it was only this time when others were also not satisfied with the Deuba. He just lead this thought of people inside congress dissatisfied and mandate he got from Gen-z that your pace is not good, do decisive, we have heard enough of you. If gen-z wouldn't have happened, everyone would have been aligned with deuba himself, and Gagan didn't had number so, he would have lost the movement and got the punishment from the Leadership. He did this (risking his political career), slowly planning, making strategies and having sense, this time he wouldn't loose. **\\[which shows he has better planning ability to get the result he wanted and this is kind of ability everyone wants is their leader\\]**  Yes, he is not best, but what happening in NC is good. Old should also get filtered. Once this old were the present RaSwaPa and they happend to be this, we need perfect Check and Balance. If NC wouldn't have did this, RaSwaPa would have got much higher seat and they would have done whatever they wanted which is wrong. We want multiple stakeholders who listen and feels the general public and NC is being transformed to that and the man leading Gagan much respect to him.  btw, for this time, my vote is for Ghanti hai (still not best, but among alternative, good than others)|||Nepal doesn’t need another PM who learns governance on the job while the bureaucracy runs circles around them. That experiment has already failed  repeatedly.  The fantasy that “outsiders are pure, insiders are dirty” is childish. Power doesn’t work that way.

You do it by putting in charge someone who knows exactly which doors to kick, which ones to lock, and which ones to burn down.  This is why someone like Gagan Thapa is a more serious PM candidate than any political outsider fantasy.|||Thikei cha aba herum k huncha.

But the chace of he being next PM is 0.01% , Nepalese people like vitality , relevence as well as someone who make big press release and do alot of advertising and want to be relevant within the political senerio of Nepal . Why don't the Nepalese polical scene doesn't favor him , He is the morally uncorrupt, transparent and his political views and principal are most clear and transparent I see from any polical leaders  who are considered new generation of political leaders in Nepal and he is more than happy to work as a background leaders and not be interested in any politics at all if someone nee get appointment as PM , his vision and how to participate in election campaign to everything is heavily inspired by developed countries and he believes in them and consider them as  part of his moral  as well as political views .|||ramailo xa Buda.|||Power hungry vayepaxi yestai ho|||Hello whoever saw this.

If people still don’t wake up and rise above their greed and ego, this might be the last time for Nepal and us as Nepalese. Why don’t they get it? They don’t develop Nepal on purpose so that they can continue asking for aids which they pocket in its entirety.  After all the sacrifices made by our ancestors to young Gen Z, if these stupid people still don’t come to their senses there will be no Nepal, just a part of India or China tomorrow.

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

I have encountered several instances of rude behavior to fast food workers, inability to remain quiet in quiet areas (hotel floors for example), and lack of common decency. This does not represent all Indian tourists by any means, but it is certainly a pattern I have come across.",

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).

So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||I'm sorry you are going through this.   The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||ekchoti uha sanga kura garnus, kina uhale yesto garnu bhayo, k karad thyo, you have already told that he isn't that much violent ani jhagada nabhakai ded barsha bhayo bhanesi he might be going through something,      he might have thought I'm having this that difficulties, while she is having fun and such, and he might have shared his difficulties with his friends who might have said something like, why would your wife stay with you or something.          ekchoti dubai jana time milayera, cool head ka sath kura garnus, kina yesto gareko, kina hatt haleko and such.    yedi yo sab bhayena, communicate nai garna nakhojne ho bhane, usko parents wa tapai kai parents lai bhannu, yedi teti bhanda ni nabhaye chai legal procedings ma janu parla.              he might have used force and violence, in the heat or anger, so try to communicate first, ask him what he thinks, why he thinks that to cause him to raise hand against you|||You work so it seems you're independent.

Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.

            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog. I also dont like Shrinkhala though.|||[deleted]|||Source-trust me bro|||Haha. I thought people saw through Baniya.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.   While I welcome reddit posts like these because it reminds people like us that each story has two sides and we need to Stop idolizing celebs/influencers, it is also important for us not to dive too much into these things and debate over 'what or who' is correct.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Government killed 1000+ youths and they burned down so many buildings. Even media houses for spreading false narrative.   And every time I see this kinda post they always undermine people’s life.   What would you do if your brother or sister were killed in that protest ?  Did you forget those videos of kids being shot??   And I hate this logic of that much destruction and all.  Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.  Why the fuck import based economy who is fully dependent on remittances talking about job ?  Job in kantipur ? Job in bhatbhateni ?

Then they strung it up on a gibbet and cooked and ate their livers.|||I don't feel any sympathy for these conry capitalist and their political overlords, with their illegal building made from ill-gotten gains. These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room. Extreme events were a result of us getting pushed to the extremes after decades of built-up anger, frustration, and fatally shooting our fellow school and college-going citizens by our own government.|||I think OP forgets the fact that on September 8th ... Videos and photos of kids with their brains splattered on the road were on full display... These kids of schools and colleges had no fault other than practising their constitution given right to protest peacefully..  and yet our security system deemed it right to kill these students .. through closed gates.. not one rubber bullet was fired not a single one. And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ?

He needs to question himself: why would someone pass a bill or law or provision that directly harms them? Someone needs to teach him that in democracy, people vouch for what benefits themselves, not the other way around.

Even the maobadi demands after armed protest were fulfilled only after they won elections and became members of parliament, not because Congress or UML fulfilled them. He needs some history lesson.

He has helped a lot to people in need.   Yes, he has done a lot of shit, I agree. But bro is just someone who is not well-informed but tries to do his best in a world that is corrupt and pathetic. So, done more harm than good is a bit of a stretch.   If a few smart people were like him, we would have had a very different Nepal, but we don't. Cause smart people are either fking out of here or don't want to involve themselves in politics (and are planning to fk out of here). This gives the chance for corrupt racist bastards to rise through the ranks and rape the country. And yes, our country has been fked over for the last two decades by corrupt politicians.   So, yes, he is doing harm. But if he was not doing jack shit, no smart people would be out there doing any better. It would be those rapist politicians who would continue to loot and fk people over.   Better him than the old jholeys, better any young people than the old jholeys.|||We’ve been victims of memetic warfare. The first mistake is assuming an entire generation thinks alike. On top of that, the whole Gen X/Y/Z framework is deeply American-centric and doesn’t translate to Nepal at all. Even if we try to create our own generational segmentation based on our political eras or developmental gaps, it still fails because people don’t exist in neat boxes. Socio-economic status, urban vs rural life, access to education, and lived experience all shape thinking. Yet we keep forcing lazy categories. And honestly, when the majority chooses not to think critically, this is exactly what we end up with and maybe what we deserve.|||Total clown show. Yes.

In my humblest opinion democracy only works when the people themselves are self civilized and have some level of  civic sense like Europeans, Japanese, Singaporeans, Chinese etc. To lead a county and control people as uncivilized as us, we desperately need some autocratic principles with strict rules and regulation with serious consequences to those who break them or else it will never work for us Nepalese.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1.

Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation.

            "body": "Call me crazy, but I genuinely believe it’s high time fathers-to-be are allowed and encouraged to be present during childbirth in all the Nepali hospitals.  When partners don’t witness the birth of their child or see the physical and emotional pain a mother goes through, it’s hard for them to truly understand how difficult motherhood really is. Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.  Maybe this is one way men can finally begin to understand a woman’s journey to motherhood. Unlike our parents’ and grandparents’ generation, societal change has to start somewhere and this feels like an important step forward.",

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being. They have to give the court a large sum of money as a \"deposit\" so they are inclined to return.  If they show up to court as promised, they get their money back. If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them. It isn’t a decision on whether they did the crime, it’s just a way to let someone live their life until the judge or jury makes a final decision.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

So I have two questions;  1. How do I make the insertion easy? Are there any tips, tricks whatsoever?   2.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship.

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit.

Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer. Maybe you need to level up your game.   Also, tech is passionate field. The whole reason you are being beaten down by AI already is you are here for money.  Dont get me wrong i have earned fortune from tech but if it was not for my passion, i would have been average guy with average payout in tech too.  Junai field maa ni tyo top maa huna you need passion.|||12YoE here.  IT is at its peak at the moment. AI can't do a shit if AI user doesn't have a solid idea of SE.    Don't spread misinformation if you don't have a complete idea of a topic.    Mass layoffs are occuring due to excessive hiring during the covid.    Be excellent and smart for your work, kasaile replace garna sakdaina.    Course matra padhne hunxan max ani job paina vanna ka suhauxa😂😂|||Aba Cybersecurity, AI/ML kun tira jada thik hola higher studies ko lagi?|||AI chalauna janne pani hunu paryo.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

Kehi galat nagaresi..  Also uhako math book ta padhekai ho|||You are expecting research contributions from him? But have you done a research about him? His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it. Or what you think my contribution to X is. Grow up.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis. Hate the bad ones and respect the good ones, be it any human from any demographic.|||BSF is for Bang-la-desh border and not ours|||Indian sub ma haldeu spamm|||ani mug wonder why we hate them|||Where is this actually?|||And fuckin Indians will be proud of this|||Ssb|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||haina hola|||It might sting but it's the truth.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

I would be more than Happy to get letters, or handmade gifts or even chocolates.. That man never did that.. So i broke up with him..blocked him everywhere and lead my life happily..

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type.

How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction. Try to understand these basics, and then you will not have to blindly learn rxns.|||On youtube watch pw lecture |||Old is gold ma vako haru pada yo sabb padna maile ta sakena yrr thett|||Haina ho sab Chinese letter dekhchu ta|||dont read all just read half the syllabus tara tyo half chai purai aunu paryo ......and u will pass|||Heri raakhnu parxa, kasto ma displacement, kasto ma substitution vanne crack vayesi sajilo hunxa|||I skipped the all organic portion but still got B+|||I didn't.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

Ani esto vaye pachi you go on talking with yourself ani most of the time you are talking yourself being angry and regret which will trigger depression.
