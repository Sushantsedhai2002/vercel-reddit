I get 2 days off per week. Honestly, Nepal is the best place for me to live, as everything just feels cheap here. My monthly expenses don‚Äôt even hit 40k npr, since I live with my family, and I can save around 300k npr per month.  I have flexible work hours and can work from anywhere in Nepal. If you spend a bit of time gaining the right skills when you are a bachelor student, you can get a remote job super easily. There are hundreds of jobs waiting for you. Earning in $$$ feels like heaven.   My advice for young Nepalese on Reddit:  \\- Bachelor ma pick up a strong tech skill. You will never regret it later.  \\- Ani, If you are a tech student, don‚Äôt ignore coding, it opens a lot of doors later on.  **My role: Offensive Security Engineer, Certs I‚Äôve earned: OSCP, OSWE, CREST (CPSA + CRT)**",

My hajurbuwa died due to negligence and misdiagnosis here. My uncle was given the wrong combination of medicine that nearly cost him his life. Noone gives a sh\\*t here. you have to deal with outdated bureaucracy anytime you need any document or other government work done. government offices have still not digitized many of their records and you might end up finding out some day like me that your old document is now nowhere to be found.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?||| invest garnu  knowledge gather gararaw  saving mantra gararaw bhanda xito wealth build up hunxa , raw inflation Lai Pani teti aasar gardinaw|||Daily work hour?|||Sites for remote jobs?

They even had a number for the ‚Äúparent‚Äù who called me crying about their kid‚Äôs grades. Total setup. Their bio literally said ‚Äúgenuine page.‚Äù Laughable.  They told me the conditions: 20% of the salary, half of the money before the demo, half after, refund if the student rejects. I paid Rs. 2000 and *immediately* everything changed. Suddenly, it‚Äôs ‚Äúno, ma‚Äôam, you can‚Äôt do that, we already arranged everything, we let you contact the parent, which we don't usually do, pay now.‚Äù Then they demanded another Rs. 2000 for the location. I agreed, they claim the QR receiver‚Äôs limit is exceeded, and asked to send it to a ‚Äúnew‚Äù QR, but plot twist I'd already paid using the previous QR and the transaction went through! Oh you've got to be fucking kidding me right?. I did. Waited for the reply then after. It‚Äôs been 15 fucking days. No location. No reply. Vanished.  I called my bank. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt help, go to eSewa.‚Äù I emailed eSewa. ‚ÄúGo to police.‚Äù I contacted the police. They pass me around, give me useless numbers, and tell me to come physically to the station, as if I don‚Äôt work and study. I‚Äôm 20, paying my own bills, for god's sake. That Rs. 4,000 was my hard-earned cash, saved up for months. And now what? It's gone.  This isn‚Äôt just anger at losing money, it‚Äôs rage at the system that lets this happen. Screenshots, transaction proofs, all useless when the institutions are slow, apathetic, and stuck in paperwork. The scammer walks away while I get bounced between departments. Where‚Äôs the accountability? Good Governance? Where‚Äôs the e-governance that textbooks brag about?  I‚Äôm furious. I‚Äôm embarrassed. I‚Äôm not someone to quietly accept this sort of stuff, but let's be realistic: people like me don‚Äôt get their money back here. It mattered, the money. Don‚Äôt trust pages with ‚Äúgenuine page‚Äù as their bio. Don‚Äôt trust anyone who pressures you to pay up front. And don‚Äôt expect the system to have your back. Why can't people live honestly, khana launei pugya thyena, gari khane awasthei nabhayera aarka lai lootdei hinni? Laaj chaina, can you face yourself in the mirror every morning? Can you sleep and eat peacefully with the things you surround yourself bought with the black money? I bet you can, and I wish much bigger misfortune falls upon you and crushes you so hard that even breathing becomes a luxury for you, fuckass CHOR.  At first, I thought it was just bad luck. I‚Äôd report it, the account would be frozen, and I‚Äôd get my money back. Boy, was I wrong. This scam hit me hard, not for the amount, but for how helpless the whole system made me feel. I might lose the money, but the embarrassment and distrust will last longer.",

Also interesed in playing and building indie type low budget games, the ones you can play on browser, like poki.com. I've been looking to build for a long time for HTML and Canvas based games (BaghChal) from scratch, but you know even in such simple game, there are a lot of things that needs to be taken care of, not the game logic, but the UI rendering logic:  Like say it's the goat's turn, and when the user playing the goat clicks on a goat to move, a circle appears, indicating that the goat has been selected to move, and when the user click another empty spot, the goat moves there if its legal. Now to take care of that,  Say its a canvas grid of 600x600. Now first we have to know the coordinates of where it was clicked, if it falls under the goat's radius, whether or not that's a legal move, that's a game logic, which i take fun writing.  That is only once the game has started, the initial game loading animation like on other mobile games you may have noticed, the menu screens and many more, right.  What would be your approach, without any Engines, to build a game like BaghChal on a JavaScript Canvas.",

            "body": "My (ex) friend let's say ‚Äú**Shakiraaaa**‚Äù was the one who actually did it.  She was 26, living alone in a tiny 1BHK in Baneshwor. The ceiling leaked, and her landlord would bang on the door every 1st of the month asking for 15k rent. Her salary was 22k after tax.  One month, her brother‚Äôs remittance from Qatar got delayed. Dashain expenses had already drained her savings, and the landlord threatened to change the lock.  Scrolling Instagram one night, she found a Dubai-based account DMing random Nepali girls:  >***‚ÄúClean feet, good arches, 500 AED per set.‚Äù***  That‚Äôs around 19,000 NPR for 10 photos. No face. No name. Just soles on a white bedsheet.  She laughed at first. Then opened eSewa and saw the balance: Rs. 1,500.  The next evening, she went to Bhatbhateni, bought a Rs. 400 white bedsheet, painted her nails red (the guy‚Äôs request), locked her door, and took 15 photos on burst mode. She sent the best 10 through Telegram.  Money transferred in 10‚Äì20 minutes. She paid her rent, bought groceries, and treated herself to a Rs. 300 coffee like nothing had happened.  We stopped being friends a month later, not because I judged her hustle, but because she started scaling it. She began coaching other 1-2 girls from of her friends circle and took a 20 percent cut as their manager. Last I heard, she had stopped doing it, got married, and moved out of Nepal.  The funniest part, she actually suggested I do a pedicure and make my feet look good like a girl because, apparently, my white feet would sell. I just laughed and stayed out of it. üòëü•≤  But, the worst thing she did was turn survival into a startup for few months.  Okay, now I‚Äôm curious. What‚Äôs the wildest thing you‚Äôve seen someone do for cash?",

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I‚Äôve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I‚Äôm revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I‚Äôll share the publication‚Äôs name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don‚Äôt even know how to open or save files and that‚Äôs completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn‚Äôt include topics that match today‚Äôs trends. What‚Äôs relevant now? AI, isn‚Äôt it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we‚Äôve been studying since grade 6. I‚Äôm now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn‚Äôt be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren‚Äôt even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad üò≠. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that‚Äôs how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn‚Äôt even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor üò≠ since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly ‚ÄúYeah i  already know html it's something i‚Äôve learned many times before and i don‚Äôt use Notepad anymore(for webdevüò≠)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects‚Äù then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like ‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú/‚Äù. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today‚Äôs topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1‚Äìh6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn‚Äôt say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later üòÖ By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don‚Äôt know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

These people didn't have any relation with the current government, nor were they ever in politics( this was done because Serbian people believe that the opposing parties are also corrupt).  >sounds cool. so, a new political party? I hope they win, they probably will.  man, I'm burned out from Nepali politics. there is a high chance that, there will be more division and more instability. AAAAAA I don't want to think about this. all I know is few people in current interim government are the best that there is. beyond that, I don't have big faith in anyone. countless factions. many opportunists. I don't see the wisdom in many. and the selflessness needed to birth a capable and wise polity. only thing we can hope for is a good political party. and that's uncertain. one thing is for sure, there are more political parties. and more division.  I'm starting to believe that almost all people are incapable of deep reasoning and far from understanding what is needed for a successful government. and in upcoming elections. discourse will be hijacked by demagogues with those shallow stirring speeches. slanders of oppositions. hard to see political culture changing for better. and if individuals are like this. it's much harder to be an impressive unit with cohesion as a government. I don't feel like things will get much better. it really felt very hopeful a month back. let's see what happens in the next elections. it's too messy to predict stuff rn. and we can't do much, I think.|||First of all, I think Serbia is on the right path and I hope the best people will win the election.   Nepal is currently administrated by an interim government which is working to hold an election within the next 5 months. This interim government is doing just fine, not the best. But as the whole system is filled with corrupts, the government hasn't been able to deliver as per the high expectations. However, I think the corruption is almost nil right now because who would dare, right? The ministers we have currently have are definitely the best ones as compared to any of the ministers before. Especially the education minister is doing great imo.   But the main question is, what would happen after the new election. If the thrown out parties came back to power, we are doomed. We do have many leaders who are respected by most and not linked with the old big parties but don't know their exact plan for the election. They must be working on it, but a lot of confusion remains, and rightfully so, because nobody was prepared for this situation. I personally have big hopes and positive vibes for the coming election as people are now more aware about the politics, especially the younger ones.|||I was very positive after the revolution but I‚Äôm worried how things are going now especially with social media/individuals/YouTube putrukar are diverting to unnecessary issues. Everyone is divided and the main culprits behind all these issues are looking for an opportunity to rise again:  - everyone praised people/celebrities for joining the revolution but the same media/individuals are after them now for damaging public property( one media started and now everyone jumped on the bandwagon). I‚Äôm against any form of violence/damaging public property however all nalayak leaders are roaming free giving speech; here the main issue is diverted to unnecessary topic. investigation should be conducted and all the real culprits for damaging public/ individual property should be punished. Now is the time to punish real culprit for their fake hope, promises and looting country. They are responsible for harming our past, present and future generations.   - Fractions on Gen-Z groups: who were together during revolution are now divided and look like they are influenced by external groups who were looking for an opportunity to address their own demands. Obviously all the issues raised during the revolution should be addressed but need to prioritise main issue: stable governance, punishment to nalayaks and reformation to bureaucracy.  - Individuals/ journalists harassing Gen-Z with their questions (which is not bad) but unable to speak in the same way to those nalayak leaders. They should be barking at them then Gen-Z group/individuals.   - Durga prasai: after all the tragedy and destruction,how can he say that he will bring another storm of protest. How can he openly request general public to make stock of food and gas at home. Enough is enough.   -People: Jumping on the bandwagon: same group of individual who attended the revolution are now planning to attend Dura prasai‚Äôs protest. Same group of individual who shared hate speech to their nalayak leaders are now praising again, same group of individuals who appreciated what they did during the revolution are not against them.   We are everywhere. Now, this is the time to be clear what and who we truly support.  . I really appreciate what this government is doing with all the challenges. I‚Äôm still positive that they will work on to make peace and prosperity.  . Based in my personal opinion.|||Im going to have to add that \"president\" vuƒçiƒá already stated that he is extremely against nepals revolution and that you burned vital money making points that your former president built out of his good heart.  Imagine what kid of an r-word you need to be to say that. I hate our politicians from the bottom of my heart and i hope for the slowest and most painful old age they can have.  Also, whoever thinks we are paid by europe and the west is under heavy propaganda, i worked on free activities when college was blocked, i talked to groups that did finances, we recieved 0 money from any political party or figure, we refused money from them when they wanted to donate, we too only small donations from non political figures, and protests were financed exclusively by that money.

For instance- we are collecting old clothes ( any kind of clothes) that could be used as bedding materials and donate those to different animal shelters. As for \"why don't we directly help the street animals with those clothes\" , even if we manage to keep those as bedding materials or for normal 'wearing' that could backfire our thoughts as random street dogs might get soaked and because of dust and all they might get allergy, sever infection and even death. Instead if we can give those collected clothes to shelters they could use them properly and prevent the death of animal from hypothermia or simply, from cold. If anybody got piled of old clothes, you know what you can do with those!  Any piece of cloth is appreciated .  Thankyou, have a good one!",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They‚Äôve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôre now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *‚ÄúIndian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.‚Äù* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn‚Äôt India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||‚ÄúPeople believe anything when it‚Äôs put between quotation marks.‚Äù   ‚Äî *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2.

Being able to build a website or a native app is great but IT is so much more than that. It‚Äôs about solving real problems and building something that impacts people.  Here in the U.S., even a simple GPT-based tool can quickly find users but in Nepal, it feels much harder to reach that same momentum.  Let me give you an example: the hospital where I worked as an intern had a big touch screen basically a TV installed in every pediatric  patient room for entertainment purpose. A Swiss company built it. They didn‚Äôt invent anything groundbreaking, but they solved a simple, practical problem. They took a regular TV, added an outer touch-sensitive layer, placed it on an aluminum frame, and turned it into a medical-grade interactive display. Each 32-inch unit cost over $4,000 and yet hospitals were happily paying for it because it worked and solved a need.  If you love software development and dream of starting a company, my advice is simple: focus on building something that solves a real problem first. Launch your product, find your audience  and let the company form around that.|||Before creating any software, validate first.   Make a fake product video, and show it to potential buyers.

I agree there is no venture captial, seed investment, taking risk in startup culture in Nepal but should we really stop ourselves from trying something blaming stuff we cannot control?|||Bhako factories haru bistarai close gardai xan.

But we are kind of slowly becoming the third party dumping ground,¬†|||Technology is like a tower with countless floors; you need to climb up one level at a time. The global average literacy rate is 86.3%, while Nepal's is 67.9%, India's is 74.4%, and sub-Saharan Africa's is 64.0%. I believe Nepal, India, and other countries should first strengthen basic education, then develop low-end manufacturing. Using the money raised from low-end manufacturing to cultivate talent is the only way to further develop high-tech. This is the same development path followed by East Asian countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. A country the size of Nepal can achieve significant development by focusing on just one technology tree. For example, Bangladesh has taken on a significant portion of China and Southeast Asia's textile industry, and its GDP growth has surpassed India's. I haven't seen such an industry in Nepal or Pakistan. India has software outsourcing, but it's far from sufficient for a country of its size. To play soccer well, one must first learn to run. If a player's running speed is the second-to-last in their class, and they constantly strive to be the third-to-last, I'm not optimistic about their future.|||Even Shark Tank US doesn't have much Tech/AI entries, not just Nepal. It isn't the show to seek funding for those products.  Shark Tank are for consumer-friendly products with a equity valuation that is set to provide quick returns for the investors.  Tech (especially AI intensive) companies in general quote an equity on a premium based on their \"future growth\". So a lot of R&D investment. It is not something that can be offered by an investor or 2. They seek Venture capital fundings for it.|||So Technology is only about software and IT ?",

            "body": "I‚Äôve been working remotely at a small service-based Indian startup for the past two months, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm not learning much.  When I joined, the CEO (who also interviewed me) mentioned there were about 10 people in the company. In reality, it‚Äôs just the two founders both working full-time elsewhere and two other interns (frontend and UI/UX).  On my very first day, I was given a task, completed it, got it reviewed, and my code was merged that same day. Since then, I‚Äôve been working on similar client projects: mostly small-scale eCommerce sites, matrimony platforms, restaurant/hotel websites, etc.  Here‚Äôs typically what I do for each project:  * Design and model the database * Set up the Django project (using pre-existing templates when available) * Build RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework * Integrate payment systems (Razorpay, Cashfree, etc.) * Implement WebSocket features if required * Document APIs and coordinate with the frontend intern * Assist with AWS deployment  I had prior experience building a single-vendor eCommerce project as a freelancer, so most of these tasks aren‚Äôt new to me. The only real learning I‚Äôve done so far is related to AWS deployment.  What‚Äôs bothering me is how *hands-off* the whole experience is, I rarely get any feedback or discussion around my code quality or architectural decisions. I just complete my tasks, push the code, and move on.  Is this normal for internships at small startups? Should I stick around for the experience on paper, or look for something that offers more mentorship and technical growth?",

But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It‚Äôs like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support üòÖ during clashes.

What kind of take is this?|||Well then both genders will have to go their own way finding their partners. It's not like only men need women or vice versa. Both genders need to have something to show for themselves to be considered by their potential partner.|||Remove the concept of marriage altogether and many girls will not find a partner in the old age because nobody wants to deal with drama anymore.|||The comments on this thread just go on to further prove the issue that the text describes. Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,¬† ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.ü§£ü§£ü§£|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s.

Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that.

What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I‚Äôd add, learn to manage your emotions too. It‚Äôs not just physical or financial survival ‚Äî it‚Äôs mental. You‚Äôll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don‚Äôt have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

They just want to escape for a while, that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no way the treatment they need isn‚Äôt possible in Nepal. They just want luxury, so they‚Äôre going to Singapore. Nothing else. This is like a vacation for them. After all this, they needed some chill time, so Singapore it is.  Now talking about the passport issue, I‚Äôm not sure about Deuba‚Äôs case, but I read that Oli has a notice against him saying he can‚Äôt even leave the valley without the permission of the authorities. About Deuba‚Äôs, I haven‚Äôt really seen the news.   Even Oli was saying something like he needs his passport to go abroad for treatment, and that too sounds like he just wants to escape for a while. He‚Äôs the same person who proudly said that Nepal‚Äôs health sector is amazing and that he trusts Nepali doctors, which is why he even did his kidney transplant here. And all of a sudden, now he wants to go abroad for treatment? Total nonsense.  So yeah, they‚Äôre just going on vacation in the name of treatment.|||2-4 danda arko pareko bhae America nai pugthyo hola|||Wtf is the purpose of the last sentence what the fuck am I supposed to say hi?|||5 choti PradhanMantri vako matrai vanera k garnu ?

At court he stated that the steering wheel of his car locked and the vehicle swung into the wrong lane hitting the pedestrian.

They had been sitting in the hotel and having lunch and beer before the accident. They had left the hotel around 5:20 pm after having beer and lunch at the Admire Cafe in Biratnagar-5. The car was being driven by MP Karki's son Rabin Singh Karki.  >The police were investigating the incident where Karki had been driving under the influence of alcohol. The police submitted the investigation report to the government prosecutor's office that Karki, who had been drinking beer at the Admire Cafe in Biratnagar-5, had hit Das at the airport mode.  >However, the police did not conduct a physical examination of Karki, saying that Karki had fled immediately after the accident. Based on the statements given by Karki's friends and the hotel owner, the police concluded that Karki had also consumed alcohol. In fact, 4 other people had also fled immediately after the accident.  >Rabin surrendered himself to the police three days after the accident. Three days later, when Karki was arrested, a medical examination could not prove whether he had been drunk on the day of the accident. Although the medical report could not confirm the intoxication, the statements of the hotel owner and the people in the car indicated that Karki, who was driving the car, had admitted to being drunk.  >Cafe owner Pankaj Sah, in his statement to the police, said that Karki and his friends had consumed 16 beers.  >Sah wrote in the statement, \"...When Rabin Karki called me and asked me to give him beer, fish and meat, as well as cigarettes, I gave them a total of 16 Mustang beers, fish and meat, and other things they had ordered.\"  >Not only Sah, but Raman Adhikari, who was inside the car when the accident occurred, also admitted to being drunk. He said in his statement, \"While going to the car, we went to Admire Cafe after being advised by the sir to eat food. Richu Giri did not eat, we all ate food including fish and meat and beer.\"  >Based on the statements of Karki's friends and the hotel owner, the police concluded that Karki had also consumed alcohol. Despite the lack of a medical examination report, a case was registered at the Morang District Court, alleging that Karki had caused the accident by driving under the influence of alcohol, based on his statement.  >Based on the police report, the District Attorney's Office, Morang, filed a case in the Morang District Court on June 15, 2078, claiming that the accident occurred due to drunk driving.   The District Attorney's Office had demanded punishment for Karki under Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act 2049 on the basis of drunk driving.  >According to Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act, if someone dies within 21 days of the accident due to reckless driving, the driver will be imprisoned for 3 years to 10 years and fined between Rs 30,000 and Rs 100,000.  >The Government Attorney's Office had termed the accident as negligence because the accident occurred due to drunk driving. The next day after the case was filed, i.e. on June 16, a closed-door hearing was held in the District Court. The District Court ordered that Rabin Karki be sent to prison for remand.  >After Karki was sent to remand for remand, the hearing resumed in the Morang District Court on September 20. During the hearing, Karki's side claimed that the accident was not due to drunk driving but due to a burst tire. Senior advocate Suresh Lal Shrestha and advocate duo Bharat Bahadur Thapa and Hari Bahadur Shrestha tried to prove that the accident occurred due to a burst tire.  >However, the district court rejected the claim that the accident occurred due to a burst tire. Three months after Karki was sent to prison, on Asoj 13, the Morang District Court found Karki guilty. However, it did not determine the punishment.  >About a week after Karki was found guilty, on Asoj 19, District Judge Sudarshan Lamichhane sentenced Rabin Karki to 3 years in prison and a fine of 35,000. Judge Lamichhane sentenced him to 3 years in prison and a fine of 35,000 for causing death by driving under the influence of alcohol under Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act 2049 BS.  >\"The facts and evidence clearly show that the defendant Rabin Singh Karki was driving a car at a high speed while under the influence of alcohol and hit Mukesh Sharma Das and Rajkumar Rajbanshi, who were walking on the roadside, due to which the car went out of control and crashed into Mukesh Sharma Das and Rajkumar Rajbanshi, who were walking on the roadside. Mukesh Sharma Das died from the same injuries and Ram Kumar Rajbanshi's left hand was broken and amputated. Therefore, it is held that the defendant Rabin Singh Karki committed the offense as per the prosecution's claim under Section 161, Sub-section 2 of the Vehicle and Transport Management Act 2049 and Sub-section 1 of 162 of the same Act,\" the verdict states.  >Karki was given only the minimum punishment for driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and causing death. The Morang District Court also explained the reason for imposing the minimum punishment. Karki is a social activist. The district court had clarified that the minimum punishment was imposed on Karki because he is a young man and does not have any other bad conduct.  >The Morang District Court was lenient towards Rabin Singh Karki and imposed only the minimum punishment. However, the Karki side was not satisfied with the district court's decision. They approached the Biratnagar High Court against the district court's decision.  >On 22 Kartik 2078, the Karki side approached the Biratnagar High Court against the district court's decision. The main purpose of the appeal was to confirm that the Karki side did not commit the offence.  >If it is possible to prove that the accident was caused by a technical fault and not by human error, then Sub-section 3 of Section 161 of the Road Traffic Act should be used. That is, if a person dies while driving without any negligence, there is a provision in Sub-section 3 that a maximum punishment of 1 year is imposed.  >The High Court, on the issue of the district causing the accident due to drunkenness, found that the accident occurred due to a burst tire. Based on that, the bench of Justices Krishna Kamal Adhikari and Jagat Narayan Pradhan of the High Court partially overturned the district court's decision, saying that the accident occurred due to a burst tire  >. 'It is natural for a vehicle that is on the verge of a sudden burst tire to shake and it can be easily assumed that an accident could occur in such a situation. Mukesh Das died because the vehicle went out of control after the tire burst and the accident occurred,' the High Court's decision, proving that the accident occurred due to a burst tire, wrote, 'The fact that the defendant was driving on his own side and caught the tire and caused the accident has been established.'  >Three months after the district court sentenced him to three years in prison, on 20 December 2078, the high court sentenced Karki to six months and 15 days in prison and a fine of Rs 2,000. The high court's decision states that Karki was not under the influence of alcohol while driving.  >**Karki obtained his license while he was in jail,**   but one thing was left out of these arguments and arguments of the two courts. The issue that the court did not consider was Karki's driving license. The police also emphasized only whether Karki had consumed alcohol or not during the investigation. The investigation regarding Karki's driving license was weak.  >Despite knowing that the person driving the vehicle was Rabin Singh Karki, the police were able to take Karki under control only after 3 days as a fugitive. That is, Karki, who was also an accused, had surrendered himself to the police office.  >It is not difficult to say that Karki surrendered to the police only after it could not be confirmed from a medical point of view that he had consumed alcohol. That is why the high court decided that the accident occurred due to a burst tire, not due to alcohol.  >Although Karki gave a statement confirming that he did not have a license, the investigating agency and the prosecuting government attorney's office did not inquire much about the driver's license.  >**How did the relevant agency fail to investigate the issue of not having a license?**  >In the statement given during the investigation, Rabin Singh Karki had said that he had obtained his motorcycle and car licenses from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. However, he had said that he did not remember his license number.  >In the District Court, Morang, he said, 'I have obtained A and B driver's licenses from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. I do not know the driver's license number at present.'  >Although he said that he had obtained the license from Koshi, Karki did not actually have a license. In fact, Karki obtained his license from the Ekantakuna License Office in Lalitpur, the federal capital, Kathmandu, that too when he was in jail due to an accident.  >Karki's mother, MP Bindiya Karki, arranged for her son, who was in jail, to get a driver's license.  >After getting the driver's license from the federal capital, Karki changed his statement. Initially, Karki stated that he had obtained the driver's license from the Koshi Zonal Transport Office, but later said that he had obtained the license from Bagmati.  >According to the Morang District Court's decision, MP Karki had submitted a photocopy of the government receipt showing that his son had obtained the driver's license in the court.  >After his mother obtained the driver's license from Bagmati, Karki changed his statement, saying, \"I mistakenly stated in question 9 of my previous statement that I had obtained the driver's license from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. I have obtained a Class B transport driver's license from the Transport Management Office, Bagmati. My Class B driver's license number is 01-06-00542589, and the date of issue is 2075.7.12.\"  >When the court asked him to produce the driver's license, Karki said that the license was lost. In his statement, he said, \"I lost the original copy of my driver's license about a year ago while coming home from Kathmandu to Biratnagar, and I have not been able to get it back because I have not been able to go to Kathmandu to get it back due to the coronavirus pandemic.\"  >However, Nepal Khabar's investigation has shown that Karki obtained the driver's license incorrectly. While Karki was in jail, a driver's license was issued in his name from a secluded corner of the Transport Management Office.  >Physical presence is required when filling out the license form. However, Karki's photo appears to be inconsistent in the details of the driver's license issued in Karki's name. The office's source said that there was a mistake in Karki's license.  >Karki had stated during his statement that he had obtained the driver's license on Kartik 12, 2075. That is, he had stated that he had obtained the license on October 29, 2018. According to the department's details, Karki's trial was held on April 13, 2018. And, the registration number of the application he submitted to the department was 67095432.  >However, this application was not in Karki's name, but in the name of Bhesh Bahadur Majhi. The computer details contained a driver's license in Karki's name, but in the other file, an application was found for Bhesh Bahadur Majhi.  >According to the department's details, Majhi had failed in his application for a driving license. However, it seems that Karki, who was made on the basis of the same application, got a driving license.  >'Amma, you're the one who got the license, man. This is a game of chance.'  >He tried to explain to me, 'Listen, sir, now I understand. Bhesh Bahadur Majhi had also failed. Someone created a license using the same failed ID in a two-digit way. In fact, this license may not be with anyone who has issued the license, but when necessary, it is shown in the name of the person who needs it.  >In fact, Bhesh Bahadur Majhi failed in the trial. His application was issued a driving license using the RID. However, after the High Court's decision, the same driving license in Karki's name appears in someone else's name.  >Initially, the driving license in Bhesh Bahadur's name reached Karki's name. After the High Court's decision, the license in Karki's name was found in the name of Sahadev Gajmer. The next day after the permit was received in Gajmer's name, it was returned to Karki's name. And, the photo previously placed in Karki's details was also changed.  >After confirming with the source, Nepal Khabar also confirmed this matter through the office. Using the Right to Information.  >'.....Since the court has made the details public along with the order, it is desirable to provide the information for journalistic purposes as per Article 27 of the Constitution of Nepal, the Right to Information Act 2064 and the Rules of the Act 2065.'  >The office then gave the information along with a copy of the transcript from the then trial. Where it is clearly written '...As per the attendance record of the examination and the experimental check list, the details seen in the name of Bhesh Bahadur Majhi are requested. Also, a certified copy of his check list and attendance is provided with this letter.'

The doctors and staff of the Sassoon Hospital have also been in jail for 18 months.  >Many things were said:¬†Pune‚Äôs culture has been ruined, Pune police and society are corrupt, etc. But in all this criticism, one good thing emerged.

Rather, in his essay, he defined ‚Äúhistory‚Äù in a broad sense: as a clash of ideological frameworks for how to legitimately govern societies.  >As Fukuyama noted, the 20th century saw immense change on this front. Democracies were rare at the start of the century, and fascism rose as an alternative model‚Äîembraced by regimes that later killed millions of people. World War II settled the democracy vs. fascism debate, for a time.  >Then, during the Cold War, communism challenged democracy, with the Soviet Union presenting a rival model for governance that was adopted by large swaths of the world. However, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the 1990s became a period of surging global democracy. In particular, much of Africa and Eastern Europe moved toward democracy.      >Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War‚Äîand the triumph of the democratic West‚Äîwould signal ‚ÄúThe End of History‚Äù in the sense that rival models to democracy had been defeated, relegated to the dust bin of history. Everyone, everywhere, would soon accept that democracy was the legitimate form of government.  >Was he right? The answer is more surprising than you might think. And it lies with a concept that I‚Äôve coined in my research, called *counterfeit democracy*.  > Most people think of democracy as a binary‚Äîyou‚Äôre either a democracy, or you‚Äôre a dictatorship (which political scientists sometimes call *autocracies*). In reality, regimes exist on a spectrum. On one end, you‚Äôve got the consolidated democracies, such as New Zealand, Japan, Denmark, Costa Rica, and Finland. On the other, you‚Äôve got the full-blown dictatorships, such as North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Equatorial Guinea.  >In recent years, global democracy has declined‚Äîin just about every index ‚Äîsince around 2006 (there‚Äôs nothing magical about this date; it‚Äôs just when more countries began lurching toward authoritarianism than the number of countries moving toward democracy on the spectrum).  >**Forgeries and Fake Democracy**  >But here‚Äôs the crucial shift: everyone *pretends* to be a democracy now, even the totalitarian dictators.  >Have you ever noticed that countries that are often awful regimes have *democratic* in their names? (The official name of North Korea is the *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea; East Germany was the German *Democratic* Republic; and the *Democratic* Republic of Congo is lying about two of the four words in its name). But those countries don‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt fool anyone. They‚Äôre straight up dictatorships, no matter the labels used.  >However, there has been a major rise in the number of in-between countries, those that have the trappings of democracy, but that, when push comes to shove, are authoritarian. I call these the *counterfeit democracies* and it‚Äôs a group that comprises, in my view, the majority of countries in the world. Within this group, you‚Äôve got countries like Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines, Madagascar, Tunisia, and countless others. They‚Äôre fake democracies, authoritarian wolves in the sheep‚Äôs clothing of democracy.  >**Many have wrongly condemned Fukuyama‚Äôs End of History argument as being naive and misguided, proven embarrassingly wrong by the** ***democratic backsliding*** **that has comprised recent global political history. How can Fukuyama be right if democracy is declining rather than surging? But his central claim‚Äîthat democracy would prevail as the consensus legitimate form of government globally‚Äîhas been proven correct by the rise of counterfeit democracies.**  >In the past, authoritarian regimes didn‚Äôt pretend to be democratic. Why bother masquerading? Now, almost all countries hold elections, and they pretend to have rule of law and other core institutions of democracy, hoping that everyone‚Äîincluding their citizens‚Äîwill be fooled by the forgery. For, like a counterfeit bank note, it only works insofar as some people believe it‚Äôs real.  >Some, such as Hungary‚Äôs Viktor Orb√°n, have tried to coin their own word, putting a positive spin on their embrace of authoritarianism. He calls it ‚Äúilliberal democracy,‚Äù which, like ‚Äúworking vacation,‚Äù is an oxymoron. If a country is illiberal‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt have the core institutions of liberal democracy, such as a free press, rule of law, protections for minorities, and freedom of speech, religion, and assembly‚Äîthen it‚Äôs not a democracy. It‚Äôs that simple. After all, who cares if there are elections if they‚Äôre rigged, or if the winner of those elections doesn‚Äôt ever gain meaningful power?  >**Counterfeit Democracy in Action**  >How does counterfeit democracy work in practice? This dynamic is on display now in Thailand, a country that looks like it‚Äôs on the [precipice of a major upheaval](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Thai-election/Thailand-s-pro-democracy-coalition-mulls-next-steps-without-Pita) and significant volatility, even though it‚Äôs not being covered much in the Western press. I‚Äôve spent many months living in Thailand and researching its politics (it‚Äôs the most coup-prone country in the world over the last century). And the Thai pattern is one that is becoming familiar to counterfeit democracies, because they‚Äôre learning from each other.  >In Thailand, the story goes like this: a popular insurgent reformer takes on the establishment. Despite barriers put in place to stop them, they win an election, sometimes in a landslide. But then, the reformer tries to dismantle outdated structures of power, taking aim at the old guard. So, the old guard punches back, making sure that the reformer doesn‚Äôt reach power, or ends up being forced out of power in a military coup. This playbook has been used to exile, jail, disqualify‚Äîeven kill‚Äîdissidents who have taken on Thailand‚Äôs entrenched dinosaurs.  >In this instance, a young, reformist party called the Move Forward Party shocked Thailand watchers by winning the elections in May. The party‚Äôs leader, [Pita Limjaroenrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat), should have easily taken power as the prime minister.  >Instead, surprise, surprise, Thailand‚Äôs military junta had changed the constitution. Now, to become prime minister, you need to win over much of the Senate, which due to ‚Äúreforms‚Äù instituted under the military general-turned-prime minister who has been in charge since 2014, is directly appointed by Thailand‚Äôs military. The Senate just blocked Pita from taking power, and barred him from seeking the role again.  >**This is the** ***modus operandi*** **of counterfeit democracies: make changes that ensure that you can have elections without real democracy. Rig the elections if you must, or, better yet, make them meaningless. Just in case your rivals get into power, fill the courts with loyalists, who will strike down legislation they pass (this one hits a bit too close to home with the United States at the moment, though it‚Äôs far more severe in most countries). Intimidate the press, either by using violence‚Äîas in Russia and Turkey‚Äîor by demonizing them relentlessly.**  >This is why all the institutions that traditionally produce accountability‚Äîdissidents, the press, independent courts, and free and fair elections‚Äîare the first targets of would-be despots.|||Atti babbal research thank you|||Paul shah ko ne video halana yar kati Sandip ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ gareko hun|||Isn‚Äôt that same Sapna Pradhan Malla (close to UML) going to become the next chief justice in a few months?|||Irrelevant but If anyone here is gay/ bi man in Kathmandu hmu.

Everything is so rapid and it's hard to grasp everything.      The bitter part for me is teachers and even classmates to some extent are strangers. I love how in school everyone knew and had different connection with every other teacher but here they just yap and go. The bond with classmates isn't great yet but I hope I will make some lifelong buddies out there.  The course is kinda hard as well and the competition is crazy asf. Einsteins here and there.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I‚Äôve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I‚Äôm revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I‚Äôll share the publication‚Äôs name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don‚Äôt even know how to open or save files and that‚Äôs completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn‚Äôt include topics that match today‚Äôs trends. What‚Äôs relevant now? AI, isn‚Äôt it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we‚Äôve been studying since grade 6. I‚Äôm now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn‚Äôt be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren‚Äôt even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad üò≠. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that‚Äôs how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn‚Äôt even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor üò≠ since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly ‚ÄúYeah i  already know html it's something i‚Äôve learned many times before and i don‚Äôt use Notepad anymore(for webdevüò≠)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects‚Äù then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like ‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú/‚Äù. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today‚Äôs topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1‚Äìh6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn‚Äôt say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later üòÖ By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don‚Äôt know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist.

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They‚Äôve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôre now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *‚ÄúIndian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.‚Äù* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn‚Äôt India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||‚ÄúPeople believe anything when it‚Äôs put between quotation marks.‚Äù   ‚Äî *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||[removed]|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else üôåüèΩ|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing? Unlike Indians?   We are not competitive enough? OR We are not Intrested enough?|||2x summer intern in faang. Oh ur location is india.|||If you are talking about direct recruiting from Nepal,  I don't know so far, but one of my friend and senior from Nepal working at VISA with the level of pay that FAANG and all does. But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||Tier1 college in India and now at Microsoft, best entrypoint is a good college in India and there are so many schemes like DASA, SII, ICCR, Compex to help you get in.

I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.

Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,¬† ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.ü§£ü§£ü§£|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases¬† What I find uncomfortably troubling is that¬† People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"¬† When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away.

Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it‚Äôs easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.

Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career.

Everything is so rapid and it's hard to grasp everything.      The bitter part for me is teachers and even classmates to some extent are strangers. I love how in school everyone knew and had different connection with every other teacher but here they just yap and go. The bond with classmates isn't great yet but I hope I will make some lifelong buddies out there.  The course is kinda hard as well and the competition is crazy asf. Einsteins here and there.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I‚Äôve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I‚Äôm revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I‚Äôll share the publication‚Äôs name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don‚Äôt even know how to open or save files and that‚Äôs completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn‚Äôt include topics that match today‚Äôs trends. What‚Äôs relevant now? AI, isn‚Äôt it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we‚Äôve been studying since grade 6. I‚Äôm now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn‚Äôt be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren‚Äôt even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad üò≠. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that‚Äôs how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn‚Äôt even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor üò≠ since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly ‚ÄúYeah i  already know html it's something i‚Äôve learned many times before and i don‚Äôt use Notepad anymore(for webdevüò≠)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects‚Äù then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like ‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú/‚Äù. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today‚Äôs topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1‚Äìh6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn‚Äôt say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later üòÖ By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don‚Äôt know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.

Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent.

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They‚Äôve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôre now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *‚ÄúIndian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.‚Äù* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn‚Äôt India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes.

I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice.

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal.

Marriage is a two way street. I can also say that a lot of women have inflated egos but I'm not gonna make such statements.   People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s. Almost nobody is well settled in their careers in their 20s.|||https://preview.redd.it/mgw54f3ymgxf1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=2354d343c7a3e21eecae47b92b774715cd28c2a1  at least comeup with some originality and authencity.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.  This should not be about man vs women if we are  in a relatively good society than Nepal but we are not in a equal society.

Mysogny should be reduced for the sake of equality, not for the sake of preventing misandry.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It‚Äôs like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support üòÖ during clashes.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,¬† ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.ü§£ü§£ü§£|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn‚Äôt the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it‚Äôs easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it‚Äôs ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

The chief guest was Mahabir Pun and a minister from Biratnagar (I really don't know who he was or what minister, but he was pretty high ranking). The guy was there in suit, garlands and several bodyguards while he sat at the stage. Mahabir Pun, on the other hand, was there on his shorts and a shirt. The minister guy gave a speech before the program commenced, and he spoke for about 15/20 minutes. Then Mahabir Pun gave his speech, literally 2 or 3 minutes long, where he managed to say everything the other guy said, but also enunciated how proud he was seeing all the young people in the room. That's when I knew about the humility of the guy. His comments after each presentations were great too, as he was really supportive of all ideas, whereas the minister looked bored to death the entire time.|||That is brand new information  üëèüëè|||Still the GOAT|||Mahabirgoat inspiring youth to breath through their nose and not through their mouth as Chronic  breathing though mouth can affect jaw and dental structure.|||Tesaile ta kulman khass chha, purana dal ko neta le ch@k batw saas ferera pollution garthe ahile kulman le nak batw sas ferera ali pollution kam bhako cha|||Why his eyes different|||Maja it pun can afford drinking petrol bt he chose to drink water.

Follow the pattern‚Ä¶ the outfits, the wedding decorations, jewellery, she made it come to reality. She followed it diligently - color, design, looks, everything. Likewise, will be her uncountable homes and more plethora of jewellery. You are making people aware what she was upto on the days of the protests and the tragedy of losing innocent lives. Some people will always defend her no matter what as most of them are paid PR people.   Her homes which she shared with the husband are perhaps and most probably their upcoming homes and redecorations which she has said she is renovating three of her houses. The Sirohiya house that was burnt down was surprisingly not lavish at all despite the corruption scale. They are of course building a new house, what else would you do with all that black money. She wants to get into politics and the scale of the house will be similar. She does everything for the clout and to portray this picture perfect curated lifestyle.  Whenever someone wants to warn people, they are always ridiculed. There were people who exposed her long time back but they were also met with unfair repercussions. People are speaking up now because her hypocrisy has been on the forefront.  You did your job, let the people do whatever they want with the info. When the time comes, they will think back and say yes there were signs but‚Ä¶.This is exactly how the corruption went overboard cause few people called out things but they were never taken seriously, this continued for decades giving the corrupt people the benefit of the doubt and even after they have been exposed now, they still have the audacity to say that they have been nothing but victims. All happened because no one listened, no one cared, no one acknowledged and there was no accountability until it was too late.  Srinkhala, her parents, her in laws and her husband are frauds and parasites. Everyone knows that but still some people don‚Äôt want to accept it and live in denial. Her brother was supposed to get married the week or following after the protests. It‚Äôs a fact! She did not disclose this, the media did. She pinned the jewelry ideas around the same time and if people still defend her then just leave it at that. If the protests did not happen, we would have seen her never ending posts about the wedding, what she wore, what she is working on as ‚Äúan architect‚Äù. Her home- her dream project will be a lavish one because it has to match her ambition and ego. She makes everything about herself, you think she won‚Äôt make her dream project about herself? Then she will come out and say it was all her vision, she got inspired by this sustainability and how her husband guided her into making better decisions like her wedding speech.  If she was really talented, her Gaatha and skincare line would not have been what it is today. Whatever little publicity those are getting are because she has been endorsing both. Nepal ma alikati kei ramro bhayo ki successful bhaihalcha. Yo ta jhan afailay endorse gareko brainchild ho re in her own words. If it is not making any rounds and not doing well then there is clearly no talent with the amount of money, position, connections, power and influence that she has especially after getting married.  So thank you for sharing what you saw to make us aware. You can‚Äôt do anything with people who want to turn a blind eye and stay oblivious/ ignorant. Bujhnay le bujhihalchan.  Yo ta kei hoina, people will see how ruthlessly ambitious she is in coming days with political scenario. ‚ÄúSamanya ghar ko tapai hami jasto manchay‚Äù dekhcha balla manchay haru le when it‚Äôs too little too late.

You can always decide whether to share or not. For now, I think saving and sharing those would have exposed her more for people who are gullible and want to remain ignorant.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

I can understand you and what I'd suggest you is to focus on the class properly sit on the first bench, listen to the teacher and mark important things that the teacher says. Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts. Understand the concept and youtube ma gayera search important topics and questions from that chapter ani practice questions regularly. Ani sabai subject thorai thorai everyday study gara.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I‚Äôve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I‚Äôm revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I‚Äôll share the publication‚Äôs name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don‚Äôt even know how to open or save files and that‚Äôs completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn‚Äôt include topics that match today‚Äôs trends. What‚Äôs relevant now? AI, isn‚Äôt it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we‚Äôve been studying since grade 6. I‚Äôm now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn‚Äôt be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren‚Äôt even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad üò≠. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that‚Äôs how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn‚Äôt even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor üò≠ since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly ‚ÄúYeah i  already know html it's something i‚Äôve learned many times before and i don‚Äôt use Notepad anymore(for webdevüò≠)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects‚Äù then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like ‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú/‚Äù. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today‚Äôs topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1‚Äìh6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn‚Äôt say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later üòÖ By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don‚Äôt know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Just praying to god that, jasari tesari pass garaideu. This tension has been eating mw from inside. Even if one gareko question tala mathi vayo vane ni fail hunasakxa. Euta question deuchoti gareko raixa maele, one is wrong one is right tara wrong vako agadi tira xa. So this realt scares me, what if teacher le tyo question ma mark nai diyena, what if teacher ko mood kharab xa, overthinking is killing me. This id literally do or die result for me. Pls pray for me guys.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.
