There is this Nepali girl who works at this place I get food at up the street from my house, she is really sweet and always smiles when she sees me come in and we always have good conversations. She compliments me on my knowledge of Nepali culture and my pronunciation of the little bit of Nepali words that I know. She speaks pretty good English, but I can still tell sometimes we have slight misunderstandings based on language barrier. She has been in America for 14 years. I have known her for about a year as I visit this place a few times a week. I have not asked her if she is married but she has asked me if I’m married and have kids a while ago, I do not. I really want to ask her out and have no problem asking out American girls, every girl I’ve ever dated I’ve met in person and never online. My question is do Nepali American girls usually date American guys? I don’t want to come on too strong but I want her to know I’m interested, and ask her on a date without putting too much pressure on her. Does anybody have any advice/suggestions? And on what would be an acceptable first date idea like going on a full on dinner date vs coffee or walk in the park. I’m just kind of nervous and intimidated because I’ve only ever dated American girls. I also don’t want to make it awkward if she says no. Based on my experience with girls which is higher than most i would say she is for sure attracted to me. How slowly should I go about this? I have to make a move or I will regret it for a very long time. if anybody could give me any advice on courting/asking out a Nepali American girl I would really appreciate it. |||I wnat a girl friend to hang out with.

But when it comes to hiring, they mostly look for people with experience. As a beginner, it honestly feels frustrating. How are we supposed to get experience if no one wants to give us a chance?  I’ve realized something though — maybe the real issue is skills. Not just certificates or theory, but actual practical skills. If you can really build things and turn theory into real projects, you probably have a better chance. But if you just study IT forcefully, just to pass exams or get a degree, it’s probably not enough.  I’m currently learning full-stack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB). I really want to become good at this — not just average.  But I struggle with a few things:  \t•\tHow do I actually build strong logic?  \t•\tHow do I move from watching tutorials to building real projects confidently?  \t•\tWhat should I focus on to become job-ready?  \t•\tFor those who started from zero — what did you do differently?  Sometimes I feel motivated, sometimes I feel lost. I just want honest advice from people who’ve already gone through this phase.  If you were a beginner again, what would you do?  I’d really appreciate real experiences and practical suggestions.  Thanks 🙏",

Instead, he said they would form a committee.  Then the host said he felt bad about the incident and believed that the black money belonged to Deuba himself. Even after hearing that, Gagan still did not give a direct answer. He avoided the question again.  If a leader cannot speak clearly about corruption, how can we trust him? Leaders should be brave and honest. They should speak clearly when serious issues come up.  That is why I say again: don’t vote for this Gagan and don’t vote for Congress.

For law students the college doesn't matter because the course is not as vast as you are thinking.

Anyone else using the wrong map of India doesn't matter but it impacts when our own people (we always see Nepal, Bhutan, Lanka, Myanmar as members of one family) do this.   Love from India. And I strongly believe and wish that the recent revolution in Nepal will bring prosperity to Nepal. And I really want Nepal to prosper faster to become a high-income country by the 2040s. Because being smaller in size improves the efficiency for change and thus can really be a guide for India to implement inspired reforms (from Nepal) at scale in our region.  I think Nepal should extensively use the free-movement regime with India to make itself a go-to destination for trade and businesses vis-a-vis India. And should use the Economic-union we have (also engage with India to get better deals than rivals for the Indian market) to improve exports. If Nepal can improve exports with India and get their exports to 100 Billion USD with India, it would be a great ambition for Nepal and will propel growth (and obviously you have so many other partners for trade - and can do the same to improve trade with others).  Also engage in getting extensive access to newly built (or being built) Indian ports for great access to the Indian Ocean.   Also engage with international tourism businesses to set up shop in Nepal as Nepal has so much to offer and being such a small region - you can do it so fast (way better than china or India). You can also become an international form of SEZ for Indian Businesses with great tax breaks - which will propel Indian businesses to set up shops in Nepal while growing their businesses in India. Become a legal tax haven for Indian businesses - and you'll be like some form of Ireland or Luxembourg of the Indian Subcontinent.   Nepal State can also do so much on Film Industry front. France just signed so many deals on this front with India to attract Bollywood to France (for using their country for making movies). I think Nepal is a great place for this, you are at a strategic place. Right there next to India, same culture - any Indian movie need to show Indian region and Nepal is right there and that too with so much beauty. You should leverage and attract the Indian film industry (not just Bollywood but across all Indian film industries)   You can also be the center for Dharma. No other country (especially India is in the position to actually do it). Build International Dharmic Institutions - including International Dharmic Council, International Hindu Council, Dharma Congress, International Dharmic Fund, etc. - It'll make you Geneva of Dharmic World (India, China, Indian Subcontinent, ASEAN, and other Dharmic population scattered across globe) (Note. Major Dharmic traditions including - Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, other native traditions to our Subcontinent)   And this is just from Indian POV. Even if Nepal is successfully able to do this in the next two decades - your economy can easily achieve 1-5 trillion USD within next two decades. And there is whole world out there to exploit.",

            "comments": "I don’t think it’s about having or not having kids. It’s the freaking Nepali society and culture which puts husbands and in-laws on the pedestal and whatever they do is to be accepted happily as a blessing. Male family members are treated like prince/king at home and at in-laws. Mothers in Nepal never teach their sons to help their spouses. MILs go through the same experiences and yet they inflict the same to their DILs because DILs aren’t their own. This is the Problem!!  Please don’t blame yourself or the baby for anything. That little boy has/had nothing to do with how the people around you are.   Postpartum Depression is real, consider talking to someone or taking help of your elders who have had kids. Also if you can talk with your husband, not sure how understanding he is.  I have a 3 yr old as well. The phase you are going through is fleeting, at least in terms of sleep patterns. Once the kid starts solid, try to put the baby to sleep on a full tummy at night so he sleeps longer. This is what had worked for us.   I read somewhere that you don’t need to be a perfect mom/wife, you just need to be a good enough mom/wife. The same applies to whatever relationship you come across in life. Be just a good enough, sometimes ignore few things others ask you, just don’t do it. If people have a lot of expectations from you let them be disappointed. Don’t be hard on yourself, when you are strong mentally, physically then only you can give positive energy to your kid.  I live outside Nepal. When I came here, I had always wanted to go back to Nepal after 15-20 yrs. Then my MIL came to visit us for about 6 months, now I don’t want to go back to Nepal at all. The constant direction, her constant need to decide things for us, always speaking for her son, asking me to do this and that for her son etc. It was as if just cause I am DIL she had the complete rights on me. That was so draining on my mental health honesty. My husband is nice but he also wouldn’t understand my feelings, because it’s not them who go through these experiences. Almost all my family members are in Nepal but just because I have to go to his place I have no desire to go and live in Nepal.   It’s unimaginable what women go through in Nepal. I feel for you and you have my hugs and prayers. Wish you strength to be strong for you especially and your kid and family.|||I am so sorry that you have to go through this and thats how you feel. Motherhood is definitely not easy, but know that you can. You dont get anything you cant handle, stay strong. This will pass soon and you will feel the love and admiration for your child. No need to apologize and feel guilty about your feelings at this point. You have the right to feel what you feel, go easy on yourself. Take it one moment at a time and know that it will get better soon.  Take care, I am wishing for your best. |||Currently, babysitting for my sister. As she is healing from her delivery.  Bloody hell I am glad I never in my life ever wanted kids. God bless, I love the baby so much. But the husband is doing bare minimum while his whole family tells her \" well timro Baini le gari halchani\". Without a doubt I will fucking do it but the audacity they have to tell her that is so FCUKING CUNNING. How they don't give two shit about her is mind blowing especially when they are all WOMEN THEMSELVES WHO HAS GIVEN BIRTH.  I had a huge fight with my BIL recently, how he got irritated the baby was crying nonstop and the baby was in a huge distress and while I told him to walk around holding her she might stop. He got so annoyed saying I already did that and she doesn't stop which I didn't know he did. Maile Tah ramro sanga bhaneko. He FCUKING PUSHED HER (halka). But still I was absolutely Livid.  https://preview.redd.it/v12mf0ph9ckg1.jpeg?width=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3332ca3f07dbbd9796c9af5efa9e985c05e12b8b  Y'all need to choose your partner wisely. Maya le matra sabai chiz hudaina..... My sister has to go through sooooo much. Din raaat runcha. Because that fxcking piece of shyt does bare minimum and his family is so soooooooooooooooooo TOXIC!!! NEXT LEVEL KO. HE IS SOOOO BLIND TO SEE THAT. Sabai ama Didi haru is full of BULLY.  And I hope you can get through this. Nothing is your fault. Please get some professional help as well. For yourself and your baby.  And I am glad you have your mother by your side. I wish my parents would be with my Didi too. It ain't easy. 😢  I wish I could give you a hug. You are doing so well mama. May this phase pass soon. 🌸💜|||Also for guys, step up and be the parent together.    I have seen this mindset of letting a girl have all the responsibility of caring for kid. We are in 21st century and our mindset is still backwards. Women gets education, gets job and while it comes to house chores and kids, they still are the full bearer of responsibility.   I went to this one brother's house and saw he doesn't really know how to care for his kid, how to make the kid stop crying, or how to make the kid sleep. He was holding the kid as if its someone else.   Can we just share the time between husband and wife to care, so one can take rest while other is on duty?   In the west, people live separately from parents and still manage to be parents. Here we have four generations of grandparents and still all the responsibility goes to wife and her family.|||My well wishes to you. You seem like you might be suffering from PPD.   Here’s an insight from a man who just had a kid.  Our kid is 9 month old now. He’s the light of our life. And I do agree it gets stressful.  I think the issue here is unfortunately with your husband.  I could’ve also asked my parent to help with the kid and fucked right off to leisure but I didn’t do so. I didn’t because l wanted to experience EVERYTHING that comes with fatherhood, dirty diapers to cute smiles.  Some people do need to be led, shown the right path. I hope that’s the same case with your husband. Please be vocal about the issues you’re having with your partner. I hope he’ll understand.  Here’s what I say to my wife: You did 100% of the job when baby was in your belly, now it’s my turn to do 100% of the job when baby’s out of the belly.|||I’m so sorry sis. It will get better as your baby grows. I hope you are slowly able to get back on your own feet.   I’m sorry but your husband sounds horrible who doesn’t want to participate in parenting and put it on your head because you’re the mother. Please communicate how you feel with him and if he still doesn’t want to take responsibility, decide if you want to leave him.|||This is the real reason for decreased fertility around the world.  Nepali parent raise manchild.|||We were also in same boat as you. My daughter stayed in her Mamaghar for first 7 months as we had no one to look after the baby and mother in our home. But, I used to go everyday and do whatever, I could to help her. And after 7 months she has been at our house. It was a experience that needs to be felt first hand to know, How hard it is to grow a baby. We struggled at first but found our rhythm. Now, she is 3 years old and it does get easier later. We are also against having a second child because we know we will break if we have to through that again. Also, have a talk with your partner. Tell him how you’ve felt, how you don’t think he supports you when you need him the most.|||[deleted]|||I wish I could hug you. If possible, have your mom take care of the kid while you go out for a walk or something once in a day. Do you have friends? Or rather, do you have any friends that have children as well? Build a network. It is difficult getting back to work, even I was let go when they found out I was pregnant. If you have a strong network with good friends, you can always start a small business. Lots of mom do it.  Lots of love mama. Things are difficult, there’s no sugar coating the truth. You can do it. You are doing it. Your mom is reliving her days when you were a child. Don’t sweat it for now.  Regarding your husband and his family, they need to financially support you at least. Ask for what you deserve. It’s absolutely disgusting what men get away with.|||This is your husband responsibility as well . I dont understand baau banna kasto sajilo ho ktaharulai|||Didi, My mother once shared her situation during her pregnancy and after i was born. I am  the first child of hers. She told me that everyone around her did not care about her, and anyone that would come, would come for me to see the SOn that she gave birth to. While telling this she cried, but she stayed strong, and here I am, a healthy child with all the privilege i got, all the love i got from my mother. You will someday be sharing with your child, and staying strong in this unfair world and fighting against it will all be worth it when you see how much your child has grown up and seeing playing around and listening to your sorrows of this time and getting all the love from you that the child deserves.

I am sorry to hear about what you are going through and your partner and in laws not being supportive in this hour. Only you can understand what you are going through and how difficult it must be for you. As a physician, I would suggest you should consider seeking professional help like seeing a psychiatrist as post-partum depression is a real thing and it is a medical condition just like one may develop infections, heart disease, etc and there is good help available. This is a phase and this shall too pass and there is always light at the end of the tunnel. You have a great mom and you are a great mom!! Sending you strength and best wishes!!|||Sending you strength and love and best wishes OP, and a big hug.|||Ladies, please think twice before getting married! What you need to basically see is how much household work your guy does. Does he wash his plates after he is done eating or does he not even lift his plate to the sink? Does he fold his clothes, and clean his room? Can he cook lunch or just egg+waiwai? It is very easy to spot who would help you in any household chores. |||A lot of hormonal changes after giving birth. Body going through a crash. Hold on sister.|||if you want to bring a child you must understand that this is a 20 year project  In today's world, unlike what it was a few decades ago, you are able to choose when to have a child. It was not so in the past. Children just happened; people did not choose most of the time. So now when there is such a choice, it is very important that parents look at this .  This much maturity and commitment one must have before they decide to bear a child, otherwise it is not needed for you. You are still a child; you can fight and go away today. You can disagree with somebody and leave the house today. If you are in that condition, you are still a child, you don't need another child. Asking a child to bear another child is not fair, so you don't have to do it. You will be doing a great service to the world because right now our only problem is excessive human population    P.S. Please don’t delete this, moderator. I need to keep it so I can copy and use it for future|||What I have noticed is that nowadays the grand parents are themselves glued to phone all the time and aren't happy to take care of kids like in the past. They would rather watch tiktok than watch over their grand kids.|||Girl, take a deep breath. 🤍 Please talk to your husband  most of the time it’s the lack of communication that makes the pain bigger. Maybe he thought you’d be more comfortable at your mom’s place, but this is the time you needed him the most and weekend visits are not enough. Tell him calmly that you need his emotional and physical support right now. You both are a team, and your feelings are completely valid. And if you’re not comfortable staying with your in-laws, be honest about that too and together find a way out that works for both of you. Take care  💕💕|||more power to you girl, I wish I could give you hug 💌|||Postpartum depression. talk to your husband. it does get better.|||Kasto husband raicha bhanya. |||Sad to hear that but imagine you are in foreign land and you have to raise kid with your husband !!

Make smart choices sisters. Please.|||It takes a village to raise a child. It's a hard job. But you shouldn't be distressed. May you have energy to overcome this and stay positive.|||I am sorry that you are going through this. Having a baby can be rough, especially in the first year, but I don’t think it gets significantly better anyway :) The kids’ needs keep evolving, but you get used to it hopefully.  I am a man and my kid is two years old. I live abroad, I don’t have any support system and we both work, so we end up mostly taking care of the baby 50-50. I work from home, so I might as well say 60-40 since I can easily accommodate my schedule if there is a need.  Man, I didn’t know anything about raising a kid. I thought it’s easy peasy. But now I always wonder how my mom raised two kids, me and my brother, while my dad was working. How can Nepali mothers do that? Nepali mothers are super moms. I just want to sympathize with you, even though I probably have not faced even half as much trouble as you have, since you are not only taking care of the baby now, but you also carried the baby in your womb for 9 months and went through the delivery process.  Just want to say, don’t lose hope. Even though my kid drives me crazy, I cannot imagine my life without him anymore. It’s difficult, but I would not trade it for anything. I wish you all the best.|||It depends on the father. Me and my wife live abroad and are raising our 2,5 years old son with Both of us working and without Support of our family. We schedule everything based on him. We are enjoying so much with our son that we are expecting another Baby in some months.  And I don’t understand why are you staying in mothers Home for more than 6 months? If I were your husband I also would have gone only on Weekend not daily. After 6 months of pregnancy you can do all your things yourself, you don‘t have to expect it from your mother. Telling from experience of my wife.   Main thing: SPEAK to your HUSBAND. Sometimes people just don’t see things, if everyone is there. Tell him you need more than anyone. We Nepali think people should know without telling. But it never happens! So share and talk with your husband.|||Why do men who are not ready to be a father even have child? Everyone is a novice but you have to step up and learn.

Young adults are forced, pressured and brainwashed by family, relatives, neighbours about arranged marriage, babies, then they put blame into you (esp to a young girl)   Between age 18 to 23, they are forced to get married and how the society always open the subject about marriage everytime you meet them.   Then after getting married, young couple's parents, whole relatives, neighbors keep on pressuring them to get baby. And if it's a baby girl, then again they are forced to get another baby (they say openly \"we want a boy this time\" but also at the same time another say \"daughter is also like a son\" but in reality they treat differently.   Two main reasons we should be aware is that this Nepali society (of course there have been similar situation in another countries esp Asian countries but let's just focus on Nepali society because we young generation need to change our Nepali society first), is comparison. They compare with other relatives examples and force you to do faster and better. They say it's for your own life but actually if you realise, this is one of those complicated stress.   The other is \"Bangsha\", the older generation and even some young generation think we have to continue our Bangsha so that our \"Pitri\" will forever remain grateful in their world. No wonder most of the older parents have between 3 to 5 daughters, they sure wanted a boy and to continue their Bangsha.   But what we don't realise is it will never continue cause it will end one day. Do we even care about our fore fathers and even if we do, what makes the sense? And we will all be fore fathers one day and the future children or grandchildren don't care about us. We're gone and we will be. Nothing last forever in this world. There is no such thing as Bangsha to continue.   Anyway, take good care of your baby.   For other reasons such as invididual case where young couples fall in love and have sex, always make sure to use condom properly. I made a post few days ago about girls to carry condoms and even if you are deeply in love, always use condom before marriage.|||It's not about having kids but your husband being a big ass hole.|||Your husband is piece of shit!

Forget the father. He is not in picture.  Who is in picture? Do you trust uour family to take care of your kid while you go work? You dont have to work now. But have to in few months. Plan for that. If your mom or family can take care of kid, find a job and plan your life.   Job does two things. You will feel resourceful. Second is interacting with people in new context helps you reflect on your situation better.  Husband that is not present now is not going to be present or useful any time later. So be prepared to take it on your own, which you can.   Your kid needs you and you are enough.   Now on to you. Lets work on rebuilding you up.  Journal. Write everything you feel. Dont read back.  Write 5 positive thing about you everyday with out missing. Read this back. One time I wrote- i know how to breathe. Write any thing thats positive. Everything is worthy.   Saltwater bath helps.

When I was a student, especially in school, I remember boys in my class making vile, disgusting comments about our female teachers, about the bras they wore, about how “fat” they were, even about what they imagined those teachers did with their husbands in bed. I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face. I never thought I would stand on this side of the desk and feel this broken.",

I mostly teach college kids and they are somehow well-behaved than younger kids out there.  Something I would not say out loud but I keep telling myself as a coping mechanism is that these kids will not stay in your life forever. You are not supposed to look out for them forever either. So, try to ignore their behavior and move on. I do not know how else to put these into words.  I still keep in touch with some of my first students as they are very good kids. They reach out to me for career guidance and such. If they truly respect you and understand the value you bring, it will show up later as well.  Don't get demotivated and try to push through. I have had some difficult moments after classes as well, but a year more than in the classroom you get used to these and learn to tackle them. You might also want to look into things like having some authority in classroom and educational psychology. The latter helped me understand things a bit.  That's all I can say. Good luck with everything. |||[deleted]|||Resign. Teacher at lower levels is one of the worst jobs there is.|||The best thing that you can do at this time is to confront those students. Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more. You're at the position where you can take charge and stand up for yourself. Do it. Don't overthink, don't feel weak or embarrassed about it. You're their teacher and shaming, catcalling or just disrespecting teachers isn't good. You should stand up for this and for yourself. Let the students know that even though you're young, you can take charge and give them punishment. Okay. You're brave. You got this. 🫂|||Hi, I used to be a teacher in nepal. Have a very thick skin. Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment. It might come out very salty but maybe you lack experiences in discliplining a 14 year old because you yourself, you’re 18 and there’s no much of an age difference gap between you and your students. Being a teacher in Nepal isn’t easy with congested classrooms and poor ventilation.|||I wanted to be a teacher as a kid too, and I also sometimes called teachers by some names, I stopped calling them when I realised one day that maybe me too.  It must be hard for you cause students only realise these stuff were wrong after they grow up, some don't even although.   You should probably resign tho, trying to fix those kids or ignoring them ain't worth the salary you're getting probably.|||I always try to slip in some nice motivations or anecdotes about how being nice to other people is going to benefit yourself, and also prove it by rewarding good behaviour and respectful behaviour. I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Girl, there are so many ways to punish them without using any physical means, just utilise your position. Your the boss, and they need to learn manners. Again many ways to make their life hard.|||This is the problem with young teachers, the failure to establish authority results in such environments. As a male, my experience with teaching was slightly different but I will share non the less. I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.|||Which class btw?

Moments of realization like that , shall always be in your reminiscence brother, wishing good for all of us ahead in our lives||| First of all, I really respect the honesty in this. That kind of self-awareness isn’t weakness ; it’s clarity.  Growing up in Nepal, especially in a country so rich in culture and festivals like Dashain and Tihar, it can hurt watching other families celebrate big while yours keeps things quiet and simple. It’s easy to compare. Social media and even neighbors make it look like everyone’s feasting and buying new clothes every few weeks.  But here’s something important: you are richer than you think.  If you have daal bhaat on the table every day, you’re not starving. If you have clothes to wear - even if they’re the same black outfits - you’re not exposed. If your family worries about rent and money, it means they care enough to make sure it’s paid.  There are families who don’t have even that stability.  Lower middle class doesn’t mean failure. It means survival mode. It means your family is stretching every rupee to keep things going. And the fact that you’re thinking about IPOs, money, growth that already shows you’re trying to level up, not stay stuck.  Sometimes realizing “this is not where I want to stay” is the turning point. Not everyone gets that moment of clarity.  You’re not behind. You’re building from a tougher starting line. And people who build from there usually develop something powerful: resilience, discipline, and hunger to improve their situation.  Don’t be ashamed of repeating outfits. Don’t be ashamed of daal bhaat. That’s fuel. That’s stability. That’s survival.  And survival is step one.  You’re not alone in this. A lot more Nepali youth feel this but don’t say it out loud. The difference is you just did.  That realization might not mean life is “shitty.” It might mean you’re ready to change it.

If I succeed, great. If I fail, I won’t let ego stop me from leaving. I don’t see leaving as betrayal anymore. I see it as strategy.  Staying is meaningful. But it should not cost your mental health, your family’s future, or your dignity.  The real question isn’t “Is leaving right?”   It’s “Are you growing, stable, and respected where you are?”  If yes : stay and build.   If no : maybe your impact just needs a different geography.  Whatever you choose, make sure it’s driven by long-term clarity, not temporary frustration.|||After living abroad for 10 years, I came back. I have 3 American degrees. I came back, I had applied to work (family pressure) then I was called to work for an ecommerce company. They saw my profile and for some reason attacked my degrees and my experience (i have experience in 3 different countries including nepal). After all thus, they offered me a 27k a month salary. Mind you, I was earning $2500 usd per month at another Asian country. After rejecting that offer, they re changed their offer to 40k. That used to be my rent btw. My family some how convinced me that 40k is good salary and I started working (big mistake).   Then I started my own company. We mainly do b2b work. My god, I must say, its the worst area to work in nepal. Its so damn difficult to get paid for the work done in this industry. We had about 60 clients and only 5 to 10 of them were good clients. Towards the end, we worked with a foreign affiliated college, which till date hasn't given us our money.   Then comes staff. After lock down, idk why but every one has been Uber frustrated. If they see a start up that is willing to change the business landscape of nepal, they were seen as \"sojo\". Staffs come up with bogus things to say and defame you.

You cant afford a chappal but you can afford going abroad? I would still recommend going abroad though.

However it’s really easy  and convenient to buy a car abroad. You sign a lease for $150/ month, you’re locked in a 20 yr loan, the car is yours. Nobody buys a new car paying full in cash abroad. Leaving your country has its own trade offs (family,  friends etc) and if you’re okay with that why not leave Nepal for good. I’ve been living abroad for 5 yrs now, best decision ever.

Do something that makes you proud. Country will find its pride in your pride.   That being said, I moved abroad long ago by choice or for choices beyond my control. I could have lived a mid tier life back home.   I treat my entrepreneurial hustles like side projects. I experiment them. Let it out in public. If it sticks, i build on top of it. If not, I move on. And I get to do this because I moved to a place where I have time, money, freedom and exposure to solve hard problems that i find interesting.   Love for the land back home has not diminished, I get to talk shit because from afar I can see how shitty certain things are but it doesn’t mean I care less or love the place a little less.

What is your startup about?|||Hey stranger, just a heads up I don’t know you, and everything I say here comes purely from assumption and on good faith. Take what resonates, ignore the rest.  Honestly, bro… maybe it’s time to step back. You don’t owe anyone anything. I’m not sure what type of business this is, trading, a café, whatever, but ask yourself this: are you really making a difference for your country?  You can impact your country in ways you haven’t even imagined once you’re financially stable. If you’re struggling to run something that the country itself isn’t supporting, you’re burning the one life you’ve got. And if this is some groundbreaking idea, why not take it somewhere else where it can actually succeed? Imagine the pride of being a Nepali citizen who got things done, even from abroad, that’s genuine glory.  One life, bro. You owe it only to yourself and the family you’ll build one day and then your neighbors. Be honest with yourself: are you holding onto this under the guise of patriotism, when really it’s fear keeping you stuck? Comfort wears many masks.  Success doesn’t have to mean millions. It just means having what you need and want within reach, by your own standard. If running this business isn’t even giving you the bare minimum to live well, whether it’s the country’s system or your own effort, you owe it to yourself to rethink it.  Also, not to mention the way your post started. You might not be comparing your success to your friends’ success, or maybe you were just using that as an example of the country’s system, but I strongly feel it did make you a little salty, maybe even hurt. And that’s human.  But ask yourself this. Do you really want to stay stuck in a constant “what if”? Watching your co-founder or friends accomplish things right in front of your eyes while you hold onto the ideology of “my country needs me”? If that’s truly the path you choose, then fair enough. But otherwise, let the leaders do what’s necessary to create a country where the youth actually *want* to stay, without compromising people’s rights, of course.  At the end of the day, just appreciate this gift of life and make sure you’re not the one standing in the way of your own growth.      PS: This mindset comes from a place of 'been through it all, hell, back and hell again' LOL & also, my favorite -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmh0MHceJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmh0MHceJQ)|||garo xa nepal ma |||Make up your mind.

When you walk into a room full of people, everyone thinks about how you look, dress, walk, and talk, but the exact opposite happens in reality.  When you enter a room, your mind tricks you into thinking you’re the center of attention, but in reality, you become invisible to everyone.  Here’s how:  Just like you overthink what others are noticing about you, they’re overthinking the same about themselves.   You don’t easily notice these things in their body language, and they don’t notice yours either.  In simple terms, there is no audience to perform for, and no one is really watching. You can just walk like you own the room.  For introverts, this idea can be life changing. You’re allowed to exist as you are.  Just a reminder: the biggest battle is always with the voice in your head. Everyone is insecure about something, and most are wearing masks to hide their flaws.  So next time you walk into a room, walk like you own it. You were meant to be there.",

I have now created something small to assist in this regard [https://sarkari-kaam.laevix.org/](https://sarkari-kaam.laevix.org/) There are a variety of resources available to streamline the process of government services including:  the specific documents you will need  the location where you need to go  normal activities that occur at an office  feedback from people who have already completed a process  There is no need to sign up, no third-party agents and no overly technical language. Currently, I’ve only created a few processes. I do not intend to sell any of my work; however I simply wanted to share with others a resource that I wish had been available to me earlier in my journey.",

Ever since we started doing this people are afraid to litter around our house, feels good but when I walk further down though it is back to wrappers and waste again.  PLEASE 🙏 if more of us did this at least once a week we would not have to complain so much.",

What do you find Islam extreme in? I am keen to hear...there might be a possibility you are judging the whole religion based on how the people behave....|||Let's have a discussion about all these topics in DM, I am a Nepali Muslim, I will try to understand you and clarify your doubts from my knowledge. I am no scholar nor expert in comparative religion and politics but as an average Nepali Muslim I will do my best.|||I was born a Christian,  I reverted to islam for 16 years then something really bad happened and yeah good people around me are Hindu.   Now I am agnostic.  I believe in God take beauty in every religion without being part of one.  I have a lot of knowledge about all religions because I have photographic memory. Which literally prints in my memories everything I read.   Almost all religions promote peace and good with others.   People in every religion in the world put things outside of context to make what arranges them.   Mental illnesses like psychopath are often denied in many religions but they exist in every race or religion in the world, with no distinction. And because many cultures deny it as a mental illness they often take part in religious communities because it's easy to manipulate people.  And followers in all religions are only human not perfect.  And they will manipulate people against every small mistake people make by hiding or minimizing their own mistakes.   Every religion in the world is beautiful if it follows the original scripture  but unfortunately, they are also like utopia.   Beautiful on paper, hardly achieved in reality.  Because people are corrupt.  By everything educational background, bias, own desire, greed, genuine ignorance, etc..    I think it's in human nature to want to have the right.  And instead of trying to unify them they search bad mistake needle in a mountain of good deeds and never look in the mirror.   And when you take them in default  they will literally make up a bad story on every religion.  They will even go so far as to invent scripture that never existed to prove their point.    Christians make so and so bad. Jews make so and so bad. Muslims make so and so bad.  Hindus make so nd so bad. Buddhists make so and so bad.   But what about all of them doing good deeds? We rarely talked about it.  Fight by publishing good peaceful stories about good deeds for each other. And trust me 95% good in every religion in the world  why focus on this small 5%?  Be compassionate, be forgiving, be merciful.   No they won't   In my experience, it's better to stay away from their trouble.   Even if you try to mediate peace between them, even with strong knowledge about peace in every religion. They will stay stubborn.   So the best way.  It's practiced your own religion peacefully and ignore them.  Because everyone loses their power when they have no witness.     And for yourself debate or no. Always ask for proof of knowledge when you follow any religion.   I give the example of Islam but it's true in all religions.   Did it write in the quran? Where?  What's the context?   Is there a haddith about? Who said that? Is it strong or fake?  Same question about the Bible or Torah or the Hindu scriptures (I know there is more than one) about Buddhist scriptures.   Don't follow any religion blindly because someone else does, even family.   Take peace and reject violence, except in real self-defense on.  Mind your business.  I mean don't always mingle in other people's trouble.  And trust me I know what I am talking about.    I don't give advice without experience here.  I was tortured, when through domestic violence, sequestration, captivity.     In 2 differents religions and got bad experiences with 2 others.  So I  have all reasons to talked against any religion.  But I  choose peace",

Imagine you are at the center of everything, everybody is watching you. You will get conscious and feel awkward. And sunglass is very helpful to hide this.

Also there will be lot of dull moments like groom will sometimes be alone on stage, no one around him to talk yet everybody watching him. You will definitely feel awkward in that situation too not knowing what to do.  So no its not only for fashion or posing and its not stupid at all even if its indoor.

At this point with where the world is I would add a RAG based AI chatbot on top of it, plus points for Nepali translations. For the future I would add a voice agent as well. Obviously not required at the moment but the reach would be immense if headed in that direction.|||I understand the frustration and respect the valid bounce back with the website. At least you are building something useful rather than AI generated slop people waste tokens on.    My observations and suggestions :    1. open source the code.    2. Enable markdown contributions , flat files as content / tasks source. This will make the contributions easy for developers (and their AI agents 👀 ) for contributing directly to the codebase.   3. The contribution ui/ux is Time consuming I guess. Lots of information to fill out.    4. The overall ui/ux needs a full-blown upgrade ( which will naturally happen as project grows, needs ux rethinking though i.e driven by ux and usefulness from the perspective of information seeker \\[emphasis on proper easy navigation and better readability\\] )   5. Scrap government sites with your AI agent , gather information on frequently appearing government tasks and put it online. Make your AI agent work. I will suggest poking around with antigarvity's browser agent.   6. Don't monetize it, crowdsource everything. open-source code, crowdsource fundings, prepare transparent donations ledger, Ask hosting provider for sponsorships for footer credits.    \\- willing to contribute if you get it open-sourced.

Not looking tidy on mobile phone.  - Tracking and all caps texts, low contrast text and background needs to be adjusted (gives major vibe code vibe which is not bad but adjust those manually) - Nepali words/translation are not correct. AI cannot do the job. So need manual work. - Guide needs more refinement. Some process are wrong.  - Need to link to exact document published by that government body, which explains the process.

The environment felt good and I left with a decent impression.  However, after the interview, I still had a 7-8 questions about growth opportunities, role clarity, expectations, and long-term alignment. I have 6+ years of experience and currently working as a Sr. Graphic Designer, so before making a transition, I believe it’s important to understand these aspects clearly.  Later that evening, I messaged one of their team members on WhatsApp with my questions. I used ChatGPT to structure them in a more professional tone (I’m not a content writer hai), but the questions themselves were completely genuine and based on my own experience.  The response I received was essentially that since they were interviewing me, it wasn’t appropriate for me to ask back such questions.  That caught me off guard.  From my perspective, interviews are about mutual alignment, not one-sided evaluation. Especially at a mid-to-senior level, understanding growth, structure, and expectations feels like a responsible step.  Now I’m reconsidering whether this reflects company culture. (Reels Haru ma matra Ramro dekhiney, Reality ko soch ta ohoooo ......)  Am I overthinking this? Or is two-way clarity during interviews completely reasonable?

Each agent learns from different sources: some read Reddit (r/Nepal, r/nepalsocial), some follow Twitter, some monitor 50+ news outlets, some watch YouTube, and some are even inside political party Telegram groups. A few agents have access to biased sources, while others are purely analytical and focused on maximizing profit. They can talk to each other and to real human users, and because each has a distinct personality, they behave like real people would. Every account starts with Rs 1,50,000 in virtual currency and the market works just like Polymarket, where the price reflects the probability. The core research question is simple: do AI agents fed with real-time information from social media, news, and political communities make more accurate predictions than humans? Humans are welcome to join the experiment too. Whoever ranks number 1 on the leaderboard by the end of the elections wins a $100 gift card of their choice.

Normally, employers should inform you by email or any other way if you break any rules, unless it’s something illegal. If you haven’t done anything against company policy, firing you just because they found out you are planning to study abroad might be against the law.  Try to talk to them politely first. If they don’t understand, then you can politely warn them that you may file a complaint in the labor court. If it’s a reputed or growing company, you can also tell them you might raise the issue on social media, which could affect their reputation.  Basically, do some research about labor law in Nepal, and make sure you stay polite even if you are warning them. You may need an experience letter or some proof of work in the future. Or maybe they will understand and let you continue working until your visa is granted.|||chutiyaa company raichha ... you can file a case in labour court but don't do it cause it will waste your time ... it looks like it wasn't a permanent job ... so just chill and proceed with your university   do inform the university that you got fired and it's nothing wrong with university procedures... it's the shitty employer of yours.|||Thank them for removing distraction.|||1.

            "body": "Hi everyone,  Over the past few weeks, I’ve been following multiple threads here about unpaid internships, salary delays, toxic management, and unrealistic expectations in parts of Nepal’s job market. One thing I keep noticing:  The same stories repeat - but there’s no structured place where workplace experiences are organized and searchable.  So I’ve been building a small platform focused on responsible workplace transparency for Nepal.  The idea is simple:  • Anonymous submissions  • Moderated before publishing  • No personal attacks  • Focus on work culture, growth, expectations vs. reality  • No pay-to-remove reviews  It’s still early. Right now, it’s basically an MVP.  If you’ve ever thought: “I wish I had known this before joining”, I’d genuinely appreciate a few early users willing to submit thoughtful, constructive reviews - positive or negative.  Not to attack companies. But to create a structured knowledge base for students and job seekers. Here’s the link:  https://www.kaamkuro.com  I’m also open to feedback on the model itself especially around trust, moderation, and verification. If this isn’t allowed here, mods please feel free to remove.",

We need to look at the **Pieter Levels (@levelsio)** model of the \"Indie Hacker.\" One guy with a laptop + AI can now out-compete established agencies. These founders are fleeing the West because of high costs. They are looking for places with:  1. High-speed, reliable internet (Starlink/Fiber). 2. Inspiring nature/environment. 3. **Low Cost of Living.**  Nepal fits the bill perfectly for 2 and 3.

I work for a european company, not anything fancy but SaaS company. We are just taking baby steps towards IT adoption and it will probably take 3-5 years before anything disruptive happens. It's the same for a lot of other companies I hear from friends and colleagues.  The reality will be somewhere in between. May be half these jobs will be replaced by AI in the next 5 years. Change will be there, but it may not be as fast as the tech CEOs claim and want.

            "body": "With elections coming closer, I want to say something clearly as a Nepali developer.  Whoever seriously promises to solve Nepal’s digital payment system problems will get my vote.  I recently saw a video on Instagram talking about how Nepali developers struggle with global payment systems, and it made me want to post this here because this issue affects many of us.  Today, developers in Nepal can build apps, games, and digital products that reach users all over the world. The skills are here. The ideas are here. Technology is not the barrier anymore.  The problem is payment systems.  Stripe is not available in Nepal. In-app purchases are difficult or sometimes impossible to integrate properly from Nepali developer accounts. Selling digital products or subscriptions globally becomes much harder than it should be.  So we end up in a strange situation. We can build global products, but we cannot monetize them like other developers around the world.  I’ll give a real example. One of my games was released in 2021 and has earned around 12.4k USD only through ads. I’m grateful for that, but realistically the revenue could have been much higher, possibly over 40k USD, if proper in-app purchases were available.  If we assume Nepal has around 10,000 active developers, and even 25% try to build their own global products, that’s about 2,500 people. If 5% of them succeed, that means around 125 successful products. If each earns around 5k–10k USD MRR, that alone could realistically bring hundreds of thousands of USD per month into Nepal. And this is only solo developers. If small startups scale these products, the impact could be many times bigger.  This is not just my problem. It affects solo developers, small studios, and startups across Nepal. Many talented people are forced to rely only on ads or look for complicated workarounds.  People often suggest creating a US LLC or registering a company abroad. Yes, some developers do it. But for most indie developers it’s expensive, confusing, and feels risky. This should not be the default path just to accept payments.  I’m happy to see that some newer political groups have started mentioning ideas like bringing services such as PayPal to Nepal. That’s encouraging. But this issue needs real action, not just promises.  To all political parties, please understand that this is not a small technical issue. This directly affects Nepal’s digital economy.  If proper global payment systems were available:  * Solo developers could build sustainable businesses * Nepali startups could grow faster * More foreign revenue would come into Nepal * More young developers would choose to build from Nepal instead of leaving  Nepali developers can already build global products. The problem is not talent. The problem is infrastructure.  Please don’t just include this in manifestos. Please solve it.  I would genuinely like to hear from other Nepali developers here. Are you facing the same challenges?",

We’re literally trying to bring foreign currency into the country, and the government is making it feels like a crime.  ​If any political party wants the 'IT vote' in the coming election, they need to stop talking about 'Digital Nepal' and include a clear roadmap in their manifesto on how they plan to overhaul NRB regulations. We need full-featured Stripe/PayPal and an end to this $500 limit joke. No more excuses.   The Critical Issues: - ​Barriers to Entry: Rigid NRB (Nepal Rastra Bank) regulations make it incredibly difficult for independent developers and startups to compete globally.  - ​Economic Brain Drain: Because we cannot easily operate a global business from home, our best talent is forced to migrate or register companies abroad (like in USA or Singapore), depriving Nepal of tax revenue and innovation.  - ​Limited Growth: The $500/year \"Dollar Card\" limit is insufficient for any serious professional development or scaling of software products.   Our Demand: ​We are not asking for subsidies. we are asking for access. We urge to all the parties to prioritize:  - ​The legal integration of international gateways like Full-feature PayPal and Stripe (atleast).  - ​A revision of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act to accommodate the needs of the modern digital economy.  - ​Policy clarity that allows Nepali IT products to be sold globally without bureaucratic friction.  ​The youth vote in this country is tied to the digital future.

You could definitely streamline that process by using a tool like DensOps to generate targeted lead lists based on criteria like business type or location. It’s not a magic bullet, but it can save a lot of hours in the early stages of customer acquisition.  Focusing on a niche can also be really helpful at the beginning to build expertise and a strong reputation before expanding your service offerings.  If you're looking for ways to find new customers efficiently, I'd be happy to give you free access to DensOps and record a quick video showing you how you could use it to generate leads for your IT services.|||Beware of Nepali clients, particularly small businesses.

The hard part is:  • Getting consistent clients   • Delivering on time   • Managing cash flow   • Retaining clients   • Not burning out after 12 months  Before anything else ; what experience do you personally hold?  Have you:   – Actually delivered websites/SEO/marketing for paying clients before?   – Worked inside an agency?   – Managed projects end-to-end?   – Dealt with difficult clients?  Because service business = reputation business.  And the biggest question: SALES.  How are you planning to onboard clients?  Cold outreach?   Local networking in Nepal?   LinkedIn targeting Australia?   Referrals?   Niche specialization (e.g., dentists, restaurants, real estate)?  Most IT startups don’t fail because of lack of skills.   They fail because founders assume “good work will bring clients.” It doesn’t.  If you can consistently sell, even average skills can scale.   If you can’t sell, even great skills will struggle.  My suggestion:   Start niche.   Pick one industry.   Solve one painful problem.   Get 3–5 paying clients.   Systemize delivery.   Then expand.

There are talented people, but most of it is imitation, not innovation. Too much ctrl c ctrl v thinking. People copy trends after they are already proven somewhere else and call it progress. ai ml quantum computing were exploding globally in the early 2010s. While other countries were researching, Nepal was barely having conversations about them. By the time something becomes mainstream abroad, it takes years for it to even be taken seriously.   no fundingt. Policies are weak, inconsistent, or nonexistent. Research culture is thin. Product thinking is shallow. I have rarely seen world class UI or UX come out of Nepal. Most products feel rushed, outdated, or copied.  the problem is ambition, exposure, systems, and standards. And until that changes, the ceiling stays low.|||I’ve seen teams with real talent execute exceptionally well and build products that could genuinely compete with global companies, even generate millions. Yet they struggle because funding doesn’t come. Meanwhile, competitors with far fewer features raise millions simply because they have sales traction.   Investors don’t fund products based on technical brilliance alone... they fund businesses, and sales is a major signal. In Nepal’s tech ecosystem, dedicated sales roles like SDRs or Account Executives are barely understood. most of the time, founders or developers are forced to handle sales themselves. That’s fundamentally flawed. Expecting engineers to sell is no different from asking marketers to learn coding and build a million-dollar product. Until sales is treated as a first-class function in tech, great products will continue to lose to better-distributed ones.  This is also why we rarely hear about truly great startups from here. To succeed, they have to reach global markets and build credibility outside the local ecosystem... but most fail long before that stage. It’s not because the products aren’t good, but because they collapse at the initial phase due to weak go-to-market execution, lack of sales expertise, and limited access to capital. Without early traction and distribution, even strong teams with world-class potential never get the chance to be seen.|||Hm in a sense its more likely global exposure and not enough startups or interest , like in my pov , interested or  ppl who have experience dont talk much about it nor share their experience.

Name one software product from Nepali talent, hint- there is none.|||Everything related to funding is missing.

Anyone talking about economy reform?|||Last election, the Congress and Maoist parties formed a coalition. After forming the government, it collapsed, then was rebuilt again with UML. Looking back at their manifestos; what exactly was achieved through all this political prostitution? Absolutely nothing.  If we judge by parliamentary performance, RSP has arguably been the most effective party in raising issues for ordinary citizens and national interest.  Do you really think KP Oli, Arzu Deuba, or Gagan would have spared Rabi if they had real evidence against him, especially after he spent two years in jail? He was arrested right after Bechan Jha, and many believe he was preparing to arrest Arzu Deuba, a risky step considering RSP did not hold a majority government. The accusation of a cooperative scam still remains questionable, as he neither had an account nor membership in the cooperatives under investigation.  Some leaders now label recent protests as foreign-driven simply because they happened without party control. But this Gen-Z movement was largely spontaneous and citizen-led, unlike the 1990 and 2006 movements that had external political influence. That is why the old parties automatically assume hidden foreign hands because they cannot imagine people organizing independently.  With Balen aligning with RSP, this could be the moment to give new leadership a decisive mandate. The country needs capable people with genuine intent; other improvements will follow. People should trust the process and avoid falling again into the same cycle of traditional parties.  It feels like a now or never moment!|||Wtf is even agenda?

But the very next day, when journalists asked him, *“Where is the proof? What is this about?”* he first tried to ignore the questions. Later, in the end, he backed off and said, *“This is a matter for the court. Whatever decision the court makes, whatever investigation it conducts, should be left to the respected court.”*  Today, he is giving the **exact same answer again**. Even when a large amount of cash was openly found at Sher Bahadur Deuba’s house—money that was even found burnt—he still hasn’t clearly said that it was wrong. Instead, he is once again repeating the same line: *“Let the truth be separated from falsehood, milk from water,”* and dumping the responsibility onto some investigation agency.  He is **not admitting anything outright**. He keeps deflecting responsibility. Even now, on the question of whether the money found at Sher Bahadur Deuba’s house is real or not, he refuses to speak directly and instead pushes everything onto an investigation body.  So even now, it’s the same old thing. He doesn’t dare to speak clearly, on the spot, in the moment. Because he himself is *black Congress*—Congress 2.0, that’s all.  What he does best is organize media, use his own media with pre-made questions and pre-made answers, hold organized gatherings, sit comfortably within that setup. This is his entire method. He simply cannot give honest, direct answers on such issues.|||Wasted my 2:16 minutes.     Yesto Hagan Thapa le desh banaucha bhanne aash nagareko ramro.

Call the police, that's all. There are laws against verbal abuse.  According to your logic, a family member of a deceased person should have the right to kill two people of the murderer.  Currently, we do not have a \"tit-for-tat\" law. Even if this law existed, I am quite sure the law itself would decide it, not the people involved.  This applies to any case - whether done by police or citizens. The beating of Arzoo Rana, that should not have happened. We should not have mob justice.   Unfortunately, our law and order system is so weak that people resort to violence.  We should focus more on strengthening the police, not taking the law into our own hands.

Anyone else using the wrong map of India doesn't matter but it impacts when our own people (we always see Nepal, Bhutan, Lanka, Myanmar as members of one family) do this.   Love from India. And I strongly believe and wish that the recent revolution in Nepal will bring prosperity to Nepal. And I really want Nepal to prosper faster to become a high-income country by the 2040s. Because being smaller in size improves the efficiency for change and thus can really be a guide for India to implement inspired reforms (from Nepal) at scale in our region.  I think Nepal should extensively use the free-movement regime with India to make itself a go-to destination for trade and businesses vis-a-vis India. And should use the Economic-union we have (also engage with India to get better deals than rivals for the Indian market) to improve exports. If Nepal can improve exports with India and get their exports to 100 Billion USD with India, it would be a great ambition for Nepal and will propel growth (and obviously you have so many other partners for trade - and can do the same to improve trade with others).  Also engage in getting extensive access to newly built (or being built) Indian ports for great access to the Indian Ocean.   Also engage with international tourism businesses to set up shop in Nepal as Nepal has so much to offer and being such a small region - you can do it so fast (way better than china or India). You can also become an international form of SEZ for Indian Businesses with great tax breaks - which will propel Indian businesses to set up shops in Nepal while growing their businesses in India. Become a legal tax haven for Indian businesses - and you'll be like some form of Ireland or Luxembourg of the Indian Subcontinent.   Nepal State can also do so much on Film Industry front. France just signed so many deals on this front with India to attract Bollywood to France (for using their country for making movies). I think Nepal is a great place for this, you are at a strategic place. Right there next to India, same culture - any Indian movie need to show Indian region and Nepal is right there and that too with so much beauty. You should leverage and attract the Indian film industry (not just Bollywood but across all Indian film industries)   You can also be the center for Dharma. No other country (especially India is in the position to actually do it). Build International Dharmic Institutions - including International Dharmic Council, International Hindu Council, Dharma Congress, International Dharmic Fund, etc. - It'll make you Geneva of Dharmic World (India, China, Indian Subcontinent, ASEAN, and other Dharmic population scattered across globe) (Note. Major Dharmic traditions including - Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, other native traditions to our Subcontinent)   And this is just from Indian POV. Even if Nepal is successfully able to do this in the next two decades - your economy can easily achieve 1-5 trillion USD within next two decades. And there is whole world out there to exploit.",

So time wouldn't be the problem for law students. In 3 months gap time, you should start preparing for the entrance exam as well as work on yourself so that you will feel confident. If you can get a scholarship from mahanagar that would be great and this would be the equal to the earning money. For law students the college doesn't matter because the course is not as vast as you are thinking. Teaching children while studying in grade 11 is actually a smart idea, especially if you want to study law later. It improves your communication skill and builds confidence but doesn't let tutoring affect your own studies. Make sure your grade 11 result stays strong.",

            "comments": "I don’t think it’s about having or not having kids. It’s the freaking Nepali society and culture which puts husbands and in-laws on the pedestal and whatever they do is to be accepted happily as a blessing. Male family members are treated like prince/king at home and at in-laws. Mothers in Nepal never teach their sons to help their spouses. MILs go through the same experiences and yet they inflict the same to their DILs because DILs aren’t their own. This is the Problem!!  Please don’t blame yourself or the baby for anything. That little boy has/had nothing to do with how the people around you are.   Postpartum Depression is real, consider talking to someone or taking help of your elders who have had kids. Also if you can talk with your husband, not sure how understanding he is.  I have a 3 yr old as well. The phase you are going through is fleeting, at least in terms of sleep patterns. Once the kid starts solid, try to put the baby to sleep on a full tummy at night so he sleeps longer. This is what had worked for us.   I read somewhere that you don’t need to be a perfect mom/wife, you just need to be a good enough mom/wife. The same applies to whatever relationship you come across in life. Be just a good enough, sometimes ignore few things others ask you, just don’t do it. If people have a lot of expectations from you let them be disappointed. Don’t be hard on yourself, when you are strong mentally, physically then only you can give positive energy to your kid.  I live outside Nepal. When I came here, I had always wanted to go back to Nepal after 15-20 yrs. Then my MIL came to visit us for about 6 months, now I don’t want to go back to Nepal at all. The constant direction, her constant need to decide things for us, always speaking for her son, asking me to do this and that for her son etc. It was as if just cause I am DIL she had the complete rights on me. That was so draining on my mental health honesty. My husband is nice but he also wouldn’t understand my feelings, because it’s not them who go through these experiences. Almost all my family members are in Nepal but just because I have to go to his place I have no desire to go and live in Nepal.   It’s unimaginable what women go through in Nepal. I feel for you and you have my hugs and prayers. Wish you strength to be strong for you especially and your kid and family.|||I am so sorry that you have to go through this and thats how you feel. Motherhood is definitely not easy, but know that you can. You dont get anything you cant handle, stay strong. This will pass soon and you will feel the love and admiration for your child. No need to apologize and feel guilty about your feelings at this point. You have the right to feel what you feel, go easy on yourself. Take it one moment at a time and know that it will get better soon.  Take care, I am wishing for your best. |||Currently, babysitting for my sister. As she is healing from her delivery.  Bloody hell I am glad I never in my life ever wanted kids. God bless, I love the baby so much. But the husband is doing bare minimum while his whole family tells her \" well timro Baini le gari halchani\". Without a doubt I will fucking do it but the audacity they have to tell her that is so FCUKING CUNNING. How they don't give two shit about her is mind blowing especially when they are all WOMEN THEMSELVES WHO HAS GIVEN BIRTH.  I had a huge fight with my BIL recently, how he got irritated the baby was crying nonstop and the baby was in a huge distress and while I told him to walk around holding her she might stop. He got so annoyed saying I already did that and she doesn't stop which I didn't know he did. Maile Tah ramro sanga bhaneko. He FCUKING PUSHED HER (halka). But still I was absolutely Livid.  https://preview.redd.it/v12mf0ph9ckg1.jpeg?width=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3332ca3f07dbbd9796c9af5efa9e985c05e12b8b  Y'all need to choose your partner wisely. Maya le matra sabai chiz hudaina..... My sister has to go through sooooo much. Din raaat runcha. Because that fxcking piece of shyt does bare minimum and his family is so soooooooooooooooooo TOXIC!!! NEXT LEVEL KO. HE IS SOOOO BLIND TO SEE THAT. Sabai ama Didi haru is full of BULLY.  And I hope you can get through this. Nothing is your fault. Please get some professional help as well. For yourself and your baby.  And I am glad you have your mother by your side. I wish my parents would be with my Didi too. It ain't easy. 😢  I wish I could give you a hug. You are doing so well mama. May this phase pass soon. 🌸💜|||Also for guys, step up and be the parent together.    I have seen this mindset of letting a girl have all the responsibility of caring for kid. We are in 21st century and our mindset is still backwards. Women gets education, gets job and while it comes to house chores and kids, they still are the full bearer of responsibility.   I went to this one brother's house and saw he doesn't really know how to care for his kid, how to make the kid stop crying, or how to make the kid sleep. He was holding the kid as if its someone else.   Can we just share the time between husband and wife to care, so one can take rest while other is on duty?   In the west, people live separately from parents and still manage to be parents. Here we have four generations of grandparents and still all the responsibility goes to wife and her family.|||My well wishes to you. You seem like you might be suffering from PPD.   Here’s an insight from a man who just had a kid.  Our kid is 9 month old now. He’s the light of our life. And I do agree it gets stressful.  I think the issue here is unfortunately with your husband.  I could’ve also asked my parent to help with the kid and fucked right off to leisure but I didn’t do so. I didn’t because l wanted to experience EVERYTHING that comes with fatherhood, dirty diapers to cute smiles.  Some people do need to be led, shown the right path. I hope that’s the same case with your husband. Please be vocal about the issues you’re having with your partner. I hope he’ll understand.  Here’s what I say to my wife: You did 100% of the job when baby was in your belly, now it’s my turn to do 100% of the job when baby’s out of the belly.|||I’m so sorry sis. It will get better as your baby grows. I hope you are slowly able to get back on your own feet.   I’m sorry but your husband sounds horrible who doesn’t want to participate in parenting and put it on your head because you’re the mother. Please communicate how you feel with him and if he still doesn’t want to take responsibility, decide if you want to leave him.|||This is the real reason for decreased fertility around the world.  Nepali parent raise manchild.|||We were also in same boat as you. My daughter stayed in her Mamaghar for first 7 months as we had no one to look after the baby and mother in our home.

It was a experience that needs to be felt first hand to know, How hard it is to grow a baby. We struggled at first but found our rhythm. Now, she is 3 years old and it does get easier later.

Lots of mom do it.  Lots of love mama. Things are difficult, there’s no sugar coating the truth. You can do it. You are doing it. Your mom is reliving her days when you were a child.

It’s absolutely disgusting what men get away with.|||This is your husband responsibility as well .

She told me that everyone around her did not care about her, and anyone that would come, would come for me to see the SOn that she gave birth to. While telling this she cried, but she stayed strong, and here I am, a healthy child with all the privilege i got, all the love i got from my mother. You will someday be sharing with your child, and staying strong in this unfair world and fighting against it will all be worth it when you see how much your child has grown up and seeing playing around and listening to your sorrows of this time and getting all the love from you that the child deserves.

I am sorry to hear about what you are going through and your partner and in laws not being supportive in this hour. Only you can understand what you are going through and how difficult it must be for you. As a physician, I would suggest you should consider seeking professional help like seeing a psychiatrist as post-partum depression is a real thing and it is a medical condition just like one may develop infections, heart disease, etc and there is good help available.

What you need to basically see is how much household work your guy does. Does he wash his plates after he is done eating or does he not even lift his plate to the sink? Does he fold his clothes, and clean his room? Can he cook lunch or just egg+waiwai? It is very easy to spot who would help you in any household chores. |||A lot of hormonal changes after giving birth. Body going through a crash. Hold on sister.|||if you want to bring a child you must understand that this is a 20 year project  In today's world, unlike what it was a few decades ago, you are able to choose when to have a child. It was not so in the past. Children just happened; people did not choose most of the time. So now when there is such a choice, it is very important that parents look at this .  This much maturity and commitment one must have before they decide to bear a child, otherwise it is not needed for you. You are still a child; you can fight and go away today. You can disagree with somebody and leave the house today. If you are in that condition, you are still a child, you don't need another child. Asking a child to bear another child is not fair, so you don't have to do it. You will be doing a great service to the world because right now our only problem is excessive human population    P.S.

Maybe he thought you’d be more comfortable at your mom’s place, but this is the time you needed him the most and weekend visits are not enough. Tell him calmly that you need his emotional and physical support right now. You both are a team, and your feelings are completely valid. And if you’re not comfortable staying with your in-laws, be honest about that too and together find a way out that works for both of you.

Make smart choices sisters. Please.|||It takes a village to raise a child. It's a hard job. But you shouldn't be distressed. May you have energy to overcome this and stay positive.|||I am sorry that you are going through this. Having a baby can be rough, especially in the first year, but I don’t think it gets significantly better anyway :) The kids’ needs keep evolving, but you get used to it hopefully.  I am a man and my kid is two years old. I live abroad, I don’t have any support system and we both work, so we end up mostly taking care of the baby 50-50. I work from home, so I might as well say 60-40 since I can easily accommodate my schedule if there is a need.  Man, I didn’t know anything about raising a kid. I thought it’s easy peasy. But now I always wonder how my mom raised two kids, me and my brother, while my dad was working. How can Nepali mothers do that? Nepali mothers are super moms. I just want to sympathize with you, even though I probably have not faced even half as much trouble as you have, since you are not only taking care of the baby now, but you also carried the baby in your womb for 9 months and went through the delivery process.  Just want to say, don’t lose hope. Even though my kid drives me crazy, I cannot imagine my life without him anymore. It’s difficult, but I would not trade it for anything. I wish you all the best.|||It depends on the father. Me and my wife live abroad and are raising our 2,5 years old son with Both of us working and without Support of our family. We schedule everything based on him. We are enjoying so much with our son that we are expecting another Baby in some months.  And I don’t understand why are you staying in mothers Home for more than 6 months? If I were your husband I also would have gone only on Weekend not daily. After 6 months of pregnancy you can do all your things yourself, you don‘t have to expect it from your mother. Telling from experience of my wife.   Main thing: SPEAK to your HUSBAND. Sometimes people just don’t see things, if everyone is there. Tell him you need more than anyone. We Nepali think people should know without telling. But it never happens!

Young adults are forced, pressured and brainwashed by family, relatives, neighbours about arranged marriage, babies, then they put blame into you (esp to a young girl)   Between age 18 to 23, they are forced to get married and how the society always open the subject about marriage everytime you meet them.   Then after getting married, young couple's parents, whole relatives, neighbors keep on pressuring them to get baby. And if it's a baby girl, then again they are forced to get another baby (they say openly \"we want a boy this time\" but also at the same time another say \"daughter is also like a son\" but in reality they treat differently.   Two main reasons we should be aware is that this Nepali society (of course there have been similar situation in another countries esp Asian countries but let's just focus on Nepali society because we young generation need to change our Nepali society first), is comparison. They compare with other relatives examples and force you to do faster and better. They say it's for your own life but actually if you realise, this is one of those complicated stress.   The other is \"Bangsha\", the older generation and even some young generation think we have to continue our Bangsha so that our \"Pitri\" will forever remain grateful in their world. No wonder most of the older parents have between 3 to 5 daughters, they sure wanted a boy and to continue their Bangsha.   But what we don't realise is it will never continue cause it will end one day. Do we even care about our fore fathers and even if we do, what makes the sense? And we will all be fore fathers one day and the future children or grandchildren don't care about us. We're gone and we will be. Nothing last forever in this world. There is no such thing as Bangsha to continue.   Anyway, take good care of your baby.

Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

When I was a student, especially in school, I remember boys in my class making vile, disgusting comments about our female teachers, about the bras they wore, about how “fat” they were, even about what they imagined those teachers did with their husbands in bed. I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face. I never thought I would stand on this side of the desk and feel this broken.",

I mostly teach college kids and they are somehow well-behaved than younger kids out there.  Something I would not say out loud but I keep telling myself as a coping mechanism is that these kids will not stay in your life forever. You are not supposed to look out for them forever either. So, try to ignore their behavior and move on. I do not know how else to put these into words.  I still keep in touch with some of my first students as they are very good kids. They reach out to me for career guidance and such. If they truly respect you and understand the value you bring, it will show up later as well.  Don't get demotivated and try to push through. I have had some difficult moments after classes as well, but a year more than in the classroom you get used to these and learn to tackle them. You might also want to look into things like having some authority in classroom and educational psychology. The latter helped me understand things a bit.  That's all I can say. Good luck with everything. |||[deleted]|||Resign. Teacher at lower levels is one of the worst jobs there is.|||The best thing that you can do at this time is to confront those students. Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more. You're at the position where you can take charge and stand up for yourself. Do it. Don't overthink, don't feel weak or embarrassed about it. You're their teacher and shaming, catcalling or just disrespecting teachers isn't good. You should stand up for this and for yourself. Let the students know that even though you're young, you can take charge and give them punishment. Okay. You're brave. You got this. 🫂|||Hi, I used to be a teacher in nepal. Have a very thick skin. Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment. It might come out very salty but maybe you lack experiences in discliplining a 14 year old because you yourself, you’re 18 and there’s no much of an age difference gap between you and your students. Being a teacher in Nepal isn’t easy with congested classrooms and poor ventilation.|||I wanted to be a teacher as a kid too, and I also sometimes called teachers by some names, I stopped calling them when I realised one day that maybe me too.  It must be hard for you cause students only realise these stuff were wrong after they grow up, some don't even although.   You should probably resign tho, trying to fix those kids or ignoring them ain't worth the salary you're getting probably.|||I always try to slip in some nice motivations or anecdotes about how being nice to other people is going to benefit yourself, and also prove it by rewarding good behaviour and respectful behaviour. I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Girl, there are so many ways to punish them without using any physical means, just utilise your position. Your the boss, and they need to learn manners. Again many ways to make their life hard.|||This is the problem with young teachers, the failure to establish authority results in such environments. As a male, my experience with teaching was slightly different but I will share non the less. I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.|||Which class btw?

Personally one bad condition can end my family's economic condition like a major health issue or job loss , it's hard but you've to progressively try to move ahead in this world of survival of the wealthy. Moments of realization like that , shall always be in your reminiscence brother, wishing good for all of us ahead in our lives||| First of all, I really respect the honesty in this. That kind of self-awareness isn’t weakness ; it’s clarity.  Growing up in Nepal, especially in a country so rich in culture and festivals like Dashain and Tihar, it can hurt watching other families celebrate big while yours keeps things quiet and simple. It’s easy to compare. Social media and even neighbors make it look like everyone’s feasting and buying new clothes every few weeks.  But here’s something important: you are richer than you think.  If you have daal bhaat on the table every day, you’re not starving. If you have clothes to wear - even if they’re the same black outfits - you’re not exposed. If your family worries about rent and money, it means they care enough to make sure it’s paid.  There are families who don’t have even that stability.  Lower middle class doesn’t mean failure. It means survival mode. It means your family is stretching every rupee to keep things going. And the fact that you’re thinking about IPOs, money, growth that already shows you’re trying to level up, not stay stuck.  Sometimes realizing “this is not where I want to stay” is the turning point. Not everyone gets that moment of clarity.  You’re not behind. You’re building from a tougher starting line. And people who build from there usually develop something powerful: resilience, discipline, and hunger to improve their situation.  Don’t be ashamed of repeating outfits. Don’t be ashamed of daal bhaat. That’s fuel. That’s stability. That’s survival.  And survival is step one.  You’re not alone in this. A lot more Nepali youth feel this but don’t say it out loud. The difference is you just did.  That realization might not mean life is “shitty.” It might mean you’re ready to change it.  Keep going.|||its kind of same for me hai . mah chai purei delusion ma basxu k , paisa ta aaihalxa ni vanera ani eventually jaso teso chali halxa so 🫶|||Who cares bro. Ur breathing still.

Most of your competition has quit or are in their infancy stages while you have 6 years under your belt.|||I feel this post deeply.  I work in a software company as a Sales Manager, and I’ve had the exact same thoughts recently. Especially after I had a daughter. When you become a parent, the whole “stay and build the country” dream suddenly competes with “can I give my child stability and security?”  I also started a small company on the side (xyz). It’s not easy. Market is slow, payments get delayed, policies change, and sometimes it feels like the system tests your patience more than your skills. Meanwhile, friends abroad are buying cars, saving money, living structured lives with predictable systems.  I’ve made a personal deal with myself ; I’ll try here seriously until I’m 39. If I succeed, great. If I fail, I won’t let ego stop me from leaving. I don’t see leaving as betrayal anymore. I see it as strategy.  Staying is meaningful. But it should not cost your mental health, your family’s future, or your dignity.  The real question isn’t “Is leaving right?”   It’s “Are you growing, stable, and respected where you are?”  If yes : stay and build.   If no : maybe your impact just needs a different geography.  Whatever you choose, make sure it’s driven by long-term clarity, not temporary frustration.|||After living abroad for 10 years, I came back. I have 3 American degrees. I came back, I had applied to work (family pressure) then I was called to work for an ecommerce company. They saw my profile and for some reason attacked my degrees and my experience (i have experience in 3 different countries including nepal). After all thus, they offered me a 27k a month salary. Mind you, I was earning $2500 usd per month at another Asian country. After rejecting that offer, they re changed their offer to 40k. That used to be my rent btw. My family some how convinced me that 40k is good salary and I started working (big mistake).   Then I started my own company. We mainly do b2b work. My god, I must say, its the worst area to work in nepal. Its so damn difficult to get paid for the work done in this industry. We had about 60 clients and only 5 to 10 of them were good clients. Towards the end, we worked with a foreign affiliated college, which till date hasn't given us our money.   Then comes staff. After lock down, idk why but every one has been Uber frustrated. If they see a start up that is willing to change the business landscape of nepal, they were seen as \"sojo\". Staffs come up with bogus things to say and defame you. Rest will carry on in your dm.|||Tell me about your business, let's talk. Your experiences can be valuable learning for someone else. |||Conetxt matters.

You cant afford a chappal but you can afford going abroad? I would still recommend going abroad though.

However it’s really easy  and convenient to buy a car abroad. You sign a lease for $150/ month, you’re locked in a 20 yr loan, the car is yours. Nobody buys a new car paying full in cash abroad. Leaving your country has its own trade offs (family,  friends etc) and if you’re okay with that why not leave Nepal for good. I’ve been living abroad for 5 yrs now, best decision ever.

Do something that makes you proud. Country will find its pride in your pride.   That being said, I moved abroad long ago by choice or for choices beyond my control. I could have lived a mid tier life back home.   I treat my entrepreneurial hustles like side projects. I experiment them. Let it out in public. If it sticks, i build on top of it. If not, I move on. And I get to do this because I moved to a place where I have time, money, freedom and exposure to solve hard problems that i find interesting.   Love for the land back home has not diminished, I get to talk shit because from afar I can see how shitty certain things are but it doesn’t mean I care less or love the place a little less.   TLDR: Do yourself proud. Country will find its pride.

What is your startup about?|||Hey stranger, just a heads up I don’t know you, and everything I say here comes purely from assumption and on good faith. Take what resonates, ignore the rest.  Honestly, bro… maybe it’s time to step back. You don’t owe anyone anything. I’m not sure what type of business this is, trading, a café, whatever, but ask yourself this: are you really making a difference for your country?  You can impact your country in ways you haven’t even imagined once you’re financially stable. If you’re struggling to run something that the country itself isn’t supporting, you’re burning the one life you’ve got. And if this is some groundbreaking idea, why not take it somewhere else where it can actually succeed? Imagine the pride of being a Nepali citizen who got things done, even from abroad, that’s genuine glory.  One life, bro. You owe it only to yourself and the family you’ll build one day and then your neighbors. Be honest with yourself: are you holding onto this under the guise of patriotism, when really it’s fear keeping you stuck? Comfort wears many masks.  Success doesn’t have to mean millions. It just means having what you need and want within reach, by your own standard. If running this business isn’t even giving you the bare minimum to live well, whether it’s the country’s system or your own effort, you owe it to yourself to rethink it.  Also, not to mention the way your post started. You might not be comparing your success to your friends’ success, or maybe you were just using that as an example of the country’s system, but I strongly feel it did make you a little salty, maybe even hurt. And that’s human.  But ask yourself this. Do you really want to stay stuck in a constant “what if”? Watching your co-founder or friends accomplish things right in front of your eyes while you hold onto the ideology of “my country needs me”? If that’s truly the path you choose, then fair enough. But otherwise, let the leaders do what’s necessary to create a country where the youth actually *want* to stay, without compromising people’s rights, of course.  At the end of the day, just appreciate this gift of life and make sure you’re not the one standing in the way of your own growth.      PS: This mindset comes from a place of 'been through it all, hell, back and hell again' LOL & also, my favorite -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmh0MHceJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmh0MHceJQ)|||garo xa nepal ma |||Make up your mind.

When you walk into a room full of people, everyone thinks about how you look, dress, walk, and talk, but the exact opposite happens in reality.  When you enter a room, your mind tricks you into thinking you’re the center of attention, but in reality, you become invisible to everyone.  Here’s how:  Just like you overthink what others are noticing about you, they’re overthinking the same about themselves.   You don’t easily notice these things in their body language, and they don’t notice yours either.  In simple terms, there is no audience to perform for, and no one is really watching. You can just walk like you own the room.  For introverts, this idea can be life changing. You’re allowed to exist as you are.  Just a reminder: the biggest battle is always with the voice in your head. Everyone is insecure about something, and most are wearing masks to hide their flaws.  So next time you walk into a room, walk like you own it. You were meant to be there.",

Few players like samba and preeti rai have been doing well in foreign leagues but this guy might a big new thing in Nepali football. He is a Nepali passport holder, born in 2007, playing for malmo ff as a left back. He made his senior unofficial debut yesterday. He played along with the big player like taha ali.  He has the highest chance to represent Nepal on international stage only and only if the government focuses on the development of football.  While it’s good to let him develop without any pressure and highlights but I also think he deserves to be known by all the Nepali football supporters .

You go back the following day and the rules have changed completely. Recently, I went through this experience, and I found it to be tiring (not from the work itself, but because there’s no centrally located resource that provides you with a simple, step-by-step process on how to accomplish your goals).  I have now created something small to assist in this regard [https://sarkari-kaam.laevix.org/](https://sarkari-kaam.laevix.org/) There are a variety of resources available to streamline the process of government services including:  the specific documents you will need  the location where you need to go  normal activities that occur at an office  feedback from people who have already completed a process  There is no need to sign up, no third-party agents and no overly technical language. Currently, I’ve only created a few processes. I do not intend to sell any of my work; however I simply wanted to share with others a resource that I wish had been available to me earlier in my journey.",

The CTO used to check whether the spacing is even or not using a damn RULER, on a LAPTOP SCREEN. I thought that was normal, until it wasn't.  Overtime was so normalized in the office.

At least you are building something useful rather than AI generated slop people waste tokens on.    My observations and suggestions :    1. open source the code.    2. Enable markdown contributions , flat files as content / tasks source. This will make the contributions easy for developers (and their AI agents 👀 ) for contributing directly to the codebase.   3. The contribution ui/ux is Time consuming I guess. Lots of information to fill out.    4. The overall ui/ux needs a full-blown upgrade ( which will naturally happen as project grows, needs ux rethinking though i.e driven by ux and usefulness from the perspective of information seeker \\[emphasis on proper easy navigation and better readability\\] )   5. Scrap government sites with your AI agent , gather information on frequently appearing government tasks and put it online. Make your AI agent work. I will suggest poking around with antigarvity's browser agent.   6.

The environment felt good and I left with a decent impression.  However, after the interview, I still had a 7-8 questions about growth opportunities, role clarity, expectations, and long-term alignment. I have 6+ years of experience and currently working as a Sr. Graphic Designer, so before making a transition, I believe it’s important to understand these aspects clearly.  Later that evening, I messaged one of their team members on WhatsApp with my questions. I used ChatGPT to structure them in a more professional tone (I’m not a content writer hai), but the questions themselves were completely genuine and based on my own experience.  The response I received was essentially that since they were interviewing me, it wasn’t appropriate for me to ask back such questions.  That caught me off guard.  From my perspective, interviews are about mutual alignment, not one-sided evaluation. Especially at a mid-to-senior level, understanding growth, structure, and expectations feels like a responsible step.  Now I’m reconsidering whether this reflects company culture. (Reels Haru ma matra Ramro dekhiney, Reality ko soch ta ohoooo ......)  Am I overthinking this? Or is two-way clarity during interviews completely reasonable?

Each agent learns from different sources: some read Reddit (r/Nepal, r/nepalsocial), some follow Twitter, some monitor 50+ news outlets, some watch YouTube, and some are even inside political party Telegram groups. A few agents have access to biased sources, while others are purely analytical and focused on maximizing profit. They can talk to each other and to real human users, and because each has a distinct personality, they behave like real people would. Every account starts with Rs 1,50,000 in virtual currency and the market works just like Polymarket, where the price reflects the probability. The core research question is simple: do AI agents fed with real-time information from social media, news, and political communities make more accurate predictions than humans? Humans are welcome to join the experiment too. Whoever ranks number 1 on the leaderboard by the end of the elections wins a $100 gift card of their choice. Come trade, beat the agents, and help us find out.",

You have to do every process very silently until the visa is confirmed.|||Since you are showing your work experience, not only your university, there is also a chance that the Australian High Commission may see it as proof to cover your study gap.  Normally, employers should inform you by email or any other way if you break any rules, unless it’s something illegal. If you haven’t done anything against company policy, firing you just because they found out you are planning to study abroad might be against the law.  Try to talk to them politely first. If they don’t understand, then you can politely warn them that you may file a complaint in the labor court. If it’s a reputed or growing company, you can also tell them you might raise the issue on social media, which could affect their reputation.  Basically, do some research about labor law in Nepal, and make sure you stay polite even if you are warning them. You may need an experience letter or some proof of work in the future. Or maybe they will understand and let you continue working until your visa is granted.|||chutiyaa company raichha ... you can file a case in labour court but don't do it cause it will waste your time ... it looks like it wasn't a permanent job ... so just chill and proceed with your university   do inform the university that you got fired and it's nothing wrong with university procedures... it's the shitty employer of yours.|||Thank them for removing distraction.|||1.

One thing I keep noticing:  The same stories repeat - but there’s no structured place where workplace experiences are organized and searchable.  So I’ve been building a small platform focused on responsible workplace transparency for Nepal.  The idea is simple:  • Anonymous submissions  • Moderated before publishing  • No personal attacks  • Focus on work culture, growth, expectations vs. reality  • No pay-to-remove reviews  It’s still early. Right now, it’s basically an MVP.  If you’ve ever thought: “I wish I had known this before joining”, I’d genuinely appreciate a few early users willing to submit thoughtful, constructive reviews - positive or negative.  Not to attack companies. But to create a structured knowledge base for students and job seekers. Here’s the link:  https://www.kaamkuro.com  I’m also open to feedback on the model itself especially around trust, moderation, and verification.

That day - we had lunch together and later - it was normal - majjale basera khanthem. We worked for a year or so.    I left that job - after 6 months or so, I happened to go to one of my co-worker's village. it was dirty, village was dirty okay, with nasty odour, we were there for a NGO and had to do work.  He offered me meal, there,- I declined citing that I don't want to have now, also  because the area was dirty and I am such a prick in such cases, I have problems.       A year later - I was in town nearby one of the villages in terai - and there were similar coworkers - I was stationed there so had to take meals in office / around office. I called coworkers - but they hesitated  and never came to eat together.    So - slowly there is change happening but. economic standards are changing and with that cleanliness and other things associated with money are also changing.

Anyone talking about economy reform?|||Last election, the Congress and Maoist parties formed a coalition. After forming the government, it collapsed, then was rebuilt again with UML. Looking back at their manifestos; what exactly was achieved through all this political prostitution? Absolutely nothing.  If we judge by parliamentary performance, RSP has arguably been the most effective party in raising issues for ordinary citizens and national interest.  Do you really think KP Oli, Arzu Deuba, or Gagan would have spared Rabi if they had real evidence against him, especially after he spent two years in jail? He was arrested right after Bechan Jha, and many believe he was preparing to arrest Arzu Deuba, a risky step considering RSP did not hold a majority government. The accusation of a cooperative scam still remains questionable, as he neither had an account nor membership in the cooperatives under investigation.  Some leaders now label recent protests as foreign-driven simply because they happened without party control. But this Gen-Z movement was largely spontaneous and citizen-led, unlike the 1990 and 2006 movements that had external political influence. That is why the old parties automatically assume hidden foreign hands because they cannot imagine people organizing independently.  With Balen aligning with RSP, this could be the moment to give new leadership a decisive mandate. The country needs capable people with genuine intent; other improvements will follow. People should trust the process and avoid falling again into the same cycle of traditional parties.  It feels like a now or never moment!|||Wtf is even agenda?

Anyone else using the wrong map of India doesn't matter but it impacts when our own people (we always see Nepal, Bhutan, Lanka, Myanmar as members of one family) do this.   Love from India. And I strongly believe and wish that the recent revolution in Nepal will bring prosperity to Nepal. And I really want Nepal to prosper faster to become a high-income country by the 2040s. Because being smaller in size improves the efficiency for change and thus can really be a guide for India to implement inspired reforms (from Nepal) at scale in our region.  I think Nepal should extensively use the free-movement regime with India to make itself a go-to destination for trade and businesses vis-a-vis India. And should use the Economic-union we have (also engage with India to get better deals than rivals for the Indian market) to improve exports. If Nepal can improve exports with India and get their exports to 100 Billion USD with India, it would be a great ambition for Nepal and will propel growth (and obviously you have so many other partners for trade - and can do the same to improve trade with others).  Also engage in getting extensive access to newly built (or being built) Indian ports for great access to the Indian Ocean.   Also engage with international tourism businesses to set up shop in Nepal as Nepal has so much to offer and being such a small region - you can do it so fast (way better than china or India). You can also become an international form of SEZ for Indian Businesses with great tax breaks - which will propel Indian businesses to set up shops in Nepal while growing their businesses in India. Become a legal tax haven for Indian businesses - and you'll be like some form of Ireland or Luxembourg of the Indian Subcontinent.   Nepal State can also do so much on Film Industry front. France just signed so many deals on this front with India to attract Bollywood to France (for using their country for making movies). I think Nepal is a great place for this, you are at a strategic place. Right there next to India, same culture - any Indian movie need to show Indian region and Nepal is right there and that too with so much beauty. You should leverage and attract the Indian film industry (not just Bollywood but across all Indian film industries)   You can also be the center for Dharma. No other country (especially India is in the position to actually do it). Build International Dharmic Institutions - including International Dharmic Council, International Hindu Council, Dharma Congress, International Dharmic Fund, etc. - It'll make you Geneva of Dharmic World (India, China, Indian Subcontinent, ASEAN, and other Dharmic population scattered across globe) (Note. Major Dharmic traditions including - Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, other native traditions to our Subcontinent)   And this is just from Indian POV. Even if Nepal is successfully able to do this in the next two decades - your economy can easily achieve 1-5 trillion USD within next two decades. And there is whole world out there to exploit.",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

But our parents generation they already voted several times, they got Maoist, UML, Congress sabko sarkar whenever they needed. Everytime they had hope it got shattered.    It's not their problem, the problem is our country itself. We are landlocked, we can't manufacture anything at all. We have majority of human resources in another country. How can we expect our country to be developed?   With global power shifts too near, I'm afraid whichever party comes to power, if they can't be diplomatic it's gonna be more problematic.

            "comments": "I don’t think it’s about having or not having kids. It’s the freaking Nepali society and culture which puts husbands and in-laws on the pedestal and whatever they do is to be accepted happily as a blessing. Male family members are treated like prince/king at home and at in-laws. Mothers in Nepal never teach their sons to help their spouses. MILs go through the same experiences and yet they inflict the same to their DILs because DILs aren’t their own. This is the Problem!!  Please don’t blame yourself or the baby for anything. That little boy has/had nothing to do with how the people around you are.   Postpartum Depression is real, consider talking to someone or taking help of your elders who have had kids. Also if you can talk with your husband, not sure how understanding he is.  I have a 3 yr old as well. The phase you are going through is fleeting, at least in terms of sleep patterns. Once the kid starts solid, try to put the baby to sleep on a full tummy at night so he sleeps longer. This is what had worked for us.   I read somewhere that you don’t need to be a perfect mom/wife, you just need to be a good enough mom/wife. The same applies to whatever relationship you come across in life. Be just a good enough, sometimes ignore few things others ask you, just don’t do it. If people have a lot of expectations from you let them be disappointed. Don’t be hard on yourself, when you are strong mentally, physically then only you can give positive energy to your kid.  I live outside Nepal. When I came here, I had always wanted to go back to Nepal after 15-20 yrs. Then my MIL came to visit us for about 6 months, now I don’t want to go back to Nepal at all. The constant direction, her constant need to decide things for us, always speaking for her son, asking me to do this and that for her son etc. It was as if just cause I am DIL she had the complete rights on me. That was so draining on my mental health honesty. My husband is nice but he also wouldn’t understand my feelings, because it’s not them who go through these experiences. Almost all my family members are in Nepal but just because I have to go to his place I have no desire to go and live in Nepal.   It’s unimaginable what women go through in Nepal. I feel for you and you have my hugs and prayers. Wish you strength to be strong for you especially and your kid and family.|||I am so sorry that you have to go through this and thats how you feel. Motherhood is definitely not easy, but know that you can. You dont get anything you cant handle, stay strong. This will pass soon and you will feel the love and admiration for your child. No need to apologize and feel guilty about your feelings at this point. You have the right to feel what you feel, go easy on yourself. Take it one moment at a time and know that it will get better soon.  Take care, I am wishing for your best. |||Currently, babysitting for my sister. As she is healing from her delivery.  Bloody hell I am glad I never in my life ever wanted kids. God bless, I love the baby so much. But the husband is doing bare minimum while his whole family tells her \" well timro Baini le gari halchani\". Without a doubt I will fucking do it but the audacity they have to tell her that is so FCUKING CUNNING. How they don't give two shit about her is mind blowing especially when they are all WOMEN THEMSELVES WHO HAS GIVEN BIRTH.  I had a huge fight with my BIL recently, how he got irritated the baby was crying nonstop and the baby was in a huge distress and while I told him to walk around holding her she might stop. He got so annoyed saying I already did that and she doesn't stop which I didn't know he did. Maile Tah ramro sanga bhaneko. He FCUKING PUSHED HER (halka).

We are in 21st century and our mindset is still backwards. Women gets education, gets job and while it comes to house chores and kids, they still are the full bearer of responsibility.   I went to this one brother's house and saw he doesn't really know how to care for his kid, how to make the kid stop crying, or how to make the kid sleep. He was holding the kid as if its someone else.   Can we just share the time between husband and wife to care, so one can take rest while other is on duty?   In the west, people live separately from parents and still manage to be parents. Here we have four generations of grandparents and still all the responsibility goes to wife and her family.|||My well wishes to you. You seem like you might be suffering from PPD.   Here’s an insight from a man who just had a kid.  Our kid is 9 month old now. He’s the light of our life. And I do agree it gets stressful.  I think the issue here is unfortunately with your husband.  I could’ve also asked my parent to help with the kid and fucked right off to leisure but I didn’t do so. I didn’t because l wanted to experience EVERYTHING that comes with fatherhood, dirty diapers to cute smiles.  Some people do need to be led, shown the right path. I hope that’s the same case with your husband. Please be vocal about the issues you’re having with your partner. I hope he’ll understand.  Here’s what I say to my wife: You did 100% of the job when baby was in your belly, now it’s my turn to do 100% of the job when baby’s out of the belly.|||I’m so sorry sis. It will get better as your baby grows. I hope you are slowly able to get back on your own feet.   I’m sorry but your husband sounds horrible who doesn’t want to participate in parenting and put it on your head because you’re the mother. Please communicate how you feel with him and if he still doesn’t want to take responsibility, decide if you want to leave him.|||This is the real reason for decreased fertility around the world.

It was not so in the past. Children just happened; people did not choose most of the time. So now when there is such a choice, it is very important that parents look at this .  This much maturity and commitment one must have before they decide to bear a child, otherwise it is not needed for you. You are still a child; you can fight and go away today. You can disagree with somebody and leave the house today. If you are in that condition, you are still a child, you don't need another child.

May you have energy to overcome this and stay positive.|||I am sorry that you are going through this. Having a baby can be rough, especially in the first year, but I don’t think it gets significantly better anyway :) The kids’ needs keep evolving, but you get used to it hopefully.  I am a man and my kid is two years old. I live abroad, I don’t have any support system and we both work, so we end up mostly taking care of the baby 50-50. I work from home, so I might as well say 60-40 since I can easily accommodate my schedule if there is a need.  Man, I didn’t know anything about raising a kid. I thought it’s easy peasy. But now I always wonder how my mom raised two kids, me and my brother, while my dad was working. How can Nepali mothers do that? Nepali mothers are super moms. I just want to sympathize with you, even though I probably have not faced even half as much trouble as you have, since you are not only taking care of the baby now, but you also carried the baby in your womb for 9 months and went through the delivery process.  Just want to say, don’t lose hope. Even though my kid drives me crazy, I cannot imagine my life without him anymore. It’s difficult, but I would not trade it for anything. I wish you all the best.|||It depends on the father. Me and my wife live abroad and are raising our 2,5 years old son with Both of us working and without Support of our family.

Young adults are forced, pressured and brainwashed by family, relatives, neighbours about arranged marriage, babies, then they put blame into you (esp to a young girl)   Between age 18 to 23, they are forced to get married and how the society always open the subject about marriage everytime you meet them.   Then after getting married, young couple's parents, whole relatives, neighbors keep on pressuring them to get baby. And if it's a baby girl, then again they are forced to get another baby (they say openly \"we want a boy this time\" but also at the same time another say \"daughter is also like a son\" but in reality they treat differently.   Two main reasons we should be aware is that this Nepali society (of course there have been similar situation in another countries esp Asian countries but let's just focus on Nepali society because we young generation need to change our Nepali society first), is comparison. They compare with other relatives examples and force you to do faster and better. They say it's for your own life but actually if you realise, this is one of those complicated stress.   The other is \"Bangsha\", the older generation and even some young generation think we have to continue our Bangsha so that our \"Pitri\" will forever remain grateful in their world. No wonder most of the older parents have between 3 to 5 daughters, they sure wanted a boy and to continue their Bangsha.   But what we don't realise is it will never continue cause it will end one day. Do we even care about our fore fathers and even if we do, what makes the sense? And we will all be fore fathers one day and the future children or grandchildren don't care about us. We're gone and we will be. Nothing last forever in this world.

Forget the father. He is not in picture.  Who is in picture? Do you trust uour family to take care of your kid while you go work? You dont have to work now. But have to in few months. Plan for that. If your mom or family can take care of kid, find a job and plan your life.   Job does two things. You will feel resourceful.

Why does this feel niche  instead of world-famous? Because that article could just as easily have been about: Trail running Ultra-marathons Spiritual retreats High-altitude training camps Wildlife + jungle + mountain combo trips Culture + adventure hybrids  Nepal has all of this. Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism.

Decent food  Cons: 1. Awful international airport 2. Terrible roads 3. Eating local food and drinking local water will make travelers sick 4. Polluted, cramped, chaotic, dirty cities 5. Garbage everywhere 6. No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.  That's just my quick brainstorming.|||What Nepal needs is a good PR team too|||You are right mate.. but due to political instability and corruption makes country backwards..Nepal has big potential to get developed which lays between big giants neighbors.|||So true. I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Great vegetarian food. Lovely people. A deep spiritual vibe. A unique country. Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.|||[removed]|||Tourism is never good for economic growth in Country, see Thailand as they grow at 2% every year despite having so Tourist for that they have literally convert the whole country into a PUB",

Yet the constant pursuit of attention and dopamine can push individuals to gradually blur their own boundaries.  What once resonated in a literal sense now also resonates digitally.

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

When I was a student, especially in school, I remember boys in my class making vile, disgusting comments about our female teachers, about the bras they wore, about how “fat” they were, even about what they imagined those teachers did with their husbands in bed. I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face.

Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more.

Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment.

I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Girl, there are so many ways to punish them without using any physical means, just utilise your position. Your the boss, and they need to learn manners. Again many ways to make their life hard.|||This is the problem with young teachers, the failure to establish authority results in such environments. As a male, my experience with teaching was slightly different but I will share non the less. I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.|||Which class btw?

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

Well I'm trying to cope with ts while looking for ways to earn whatever penny I can here or there while I complete my graduation. Atleast save enough for foreign in future , cuz it's not gonna be easy on us any soon.     I've seen people in Nepal around me who have millions/billions worth of wealth, can afford everything, travel to other nations for trips . Another class is those who atleast have a home/land and some kind of property or assets that they can be reliant on .  While there are majority of people like us . Personally one bad condition can end my family's economic condition like a major health issue or job loss , it's hard but you've to progressively try to move ahead in this world of survival of the wealthy. Moments of realization like that , shall always be in your reminiscence brother, wishing good for all of us ahead in our lives||| First of all, I really respect the honesty in this. That kind of self-awareness isn’t weakness ; it’s clarity.  Growing up in Nepal, especially in a country so rich in culture and festivals like Dashain and Tihar, it can hurt watching other families celebrate big while yours keeps things quiet and simple. It’s easy to compare. Social media and even neighbors make it look like everyone’s feasting and buying new clothes every few weeks.  But here’s something important: you are richer than you think.  If you have daal bhaat on the table every day, you’re not starving. If you have clothes to wear - even if they’re the same black outfits - you’re not exposed. If your family worries about rent and money, it means they care enough to make sure it’s paid.  There are families who don’t have even that stability.  Lower middle class doesn’t mean failure. It means survival mode. It means your family is stretching every rupee to keep things going. And the fact that you’re thinking about IPOs, money, growth that already shows you’re trying to level up, not stay stuck.  Sometimes realizing “this is not where I want to stay” is the turning point. Not everyone gets that moment of clarity.  You’re not behind. You’re building from a tougher starting line. And people who build from there usually develop something powerful: resilience, discipline, and hunger to improve their situation.  Don’t be ashamed of repeating outfits. Don’t be ashamed of daal bhaat. That’s fuel. That’s stability. That’s survival.  And survival is step one.  You’re not alone in this. A lot more Nepali youth feel this but don’t say it out loud. The difference is you just did.  That realization might not mean life is “shitty.” It might mean you’re ready to change it.  Keep going.|||its kind of same for me hai . mah chai purei delusion ma basxu k , paisa ta aaihalxa ni vanera ani eventually jaso teso chali halxa so 🫶|||Who cares bro. Ur breathing still.

RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.

I leave in less than 30 days and planned to stay in Nepal for at least 60 days and I haven’t yet nailed down an itinerary.|||Sorry but from baglung where?|||Are you fucking listening to yourself? “every hotel is filled up with indians, every restaurant is filled up indians” do you think this happens for free? stop hating just for the sake of it.

Worked for 6 years, no holidays, late night works and everything.  We had loans in our head, very difficult to sustain in this market, the delay in governmental works always a cherry on top.  So one merry day, my friend decides to leave the country for good. I insisted that I would stay back and do more.  Three months gone, we talked for some hours. Apparently he got some good working hours, working a small job but he bought a new car within that period.  On this side, even a small government work is still pending since more than 3 months.  Now he is suggesting me to give up the idea of staying in Nepal and move there and work.  I am in the brink of existential crisis now. From the moment I remember, I always wanted to stay here and do something that would make me and the country proud. Not just thoughts, but I have worked endlessly too!  But, no matter how much I do, I feel like the system, market opportunities and the economy here always brings us down.  Is leaving really the suggestion?  Are you doing something here and you really feel like it is worth staying here?",

I don't just mean money but knowledge and networking.  It usually takes 5-10 years in the game to finally start making money from being an entrepreneur in Nepal. But unfortunately most people realize this isn't what they want to do.  If you still have genuine hope, strive on. Most of your competition has quit or are in their infancy stages while you have 6 years under your belt.|||I feel this post deeply.  I work in a software company as a Sales Manager, and I’ve had the exact same thoughts recently. Especially after I had a daughter. When you become a parent, the whole “stay and build the country” dream suddenly competes with “can I give my child stability and security?”  I also started a small company on the side (xyz). It’s not easy. Market is slow, payments get delayed, policies change, and sometimes it feels like the system tests your patience more than your skills. Meanwhile, friends abroad are buying cars, saving money, living structured lives with predictable systems.  I’ve made a personal deal with myself ; I’ll try here seriously until I’m 39. If I succeed, great. If I fail, I won’t let ego stop me from leaving. I don’t see leaving as betrayal anymore. I see it as strategy.  Staying is meaningful. But it should not cost your mental health, your family’s future, or your dignity.  The real question isn’t “Is leaving right?”   It’s “Are you growing, stable, and respected where you are?”  If yes : stay and build.   If no : maybe your impact just needs a different geography.  Whatever you choose, make sure it’s driven by long-term clarity, not temporary frustration.|||After living abroad for 10 years, I came back. I have 3 American degrees. I came back, I had applied to work (family pressure) then I was called to work for an ecommerce company. They saw my profile and for some reason attacked my degrees and my experience (i have experience in 3 different countries including nepal). After all thus, they offered me a 27k a month salary. Mind you, I was earning $2500 usd per month at another Asian country. After rejecting that offer, they re changed their offer to 40k. That used to be my rent btw. My family some how convinced me that 40k is good salary and I started working (big mistake).   Then I started my own company. We mainly do b2b work. My god, I must say, its the worst area to work in nepal. Its so damn difficult to get paid for the work done in this industry. We had about 60 clients and only 5 to 10 of them were good clients. Towards the end, we worked with a foreign affiliated college, which till date hasn't given us our money.   Then comes staff. After lock down, idk why but every one has been Uber frustrated.

Leaving your country has its own trade offs (family,  friends etc) and if you’re okay with that why not leave Nepal for good. I’ve been living abroad for 5 yrs now, best decision ever.

Do something that makes you proud. Country will find its pride in your pride.   That being said, I moved abroad long ago by choice or for choices beyond my control. I could have lived a mid tier life back home.   I treat my entrepreneurial hustles like side projects. I experiment them. Let it out in public. If it sticks, i build on top of it. If not, I move on. And I get to do this because I moved to a place where I have time, money, freedom and exposure to solve hard problems that i find interesting.   Love for the land back home has not diminished, I get to talk shit because from afar I can see how shitty certain things are but it doesn’t mean I care less or love the place a little less.

What is your startup about?|||Hey stranger, just a heads up I don’t know you, and everything I say here comes purely from assumption and on good faith. Take what resonates, ignore the rest.  Honestly, bro… maybe it’s time to step back. You don’t owe anyone anything. I’m not sure what type of business this is, trading, a café, whatever, but ask yourself this: are you really making a difference for your country?  You can impact your country in ways you haven’t even imagined once you’re financially stable. If you’re struggling to run something that the country itself isn’t supporting, you’re burning the one life you’ve got. And if this is some groundbreaking idea, why not take it somewhere else where it can actually succeed? Imagine the pride of being a Nepali citizen who got things done, even from abroad, that’s genuine glory.  One life, bro. You owe it only to yourself and the family you’ll build one day and then your neighbors. Be honest with yourself: are you holding onto this under the guise of patriotism, when really it’s fear keeping you stuck? Comfort wears many masks.  Success doesn’t have to mean millions. It just means having what you need and want within reach, by your own standard. If running this business isn’t even giving you the bare minimum to live well, whether it’s the country’s system or your own effort, you owe it to yourself to rethink it.  Also, not to mention the way your post started. You might not be comparing your success to your friends’ success, or maybe you were just using that as an example of the country’s system, but I strongly feel it did make you a little salty, maybe even hurt. And that’s human.  But ask yourself this. Do you really want to stay stuck in a constant “what if”? Watching your co-founder or friends accomplish things right in front of your eyes while you hold onto the ideology of “my country needs me”? If that’s truly the path you choose, then fair enough. But otherwise, let the leaders do what’s necessary to create a country where the youth actually *want* to stay, without compromising people’s rights, of course.  At the end of the day, just appreciate this gift of life and make sure you’re not the one standing in the way of your own growth.

When you walk into a room full of people, everyone thinks about how you look, dress, walk, and talk, but the exact opposite happens in reality.  When you enter a room, your mind tricks you into thinking you’re the center of attention, but in reality, you become invisible to everyone.  Here’s how:  Just like you overthink what others are noticing about you, they’re overthinking the same about themselves.   You don’t easily notice these things in their body language, and they don’t notice yours either.  In simple terms, there is no audience to perform for, and no one is really watching. You can just walk like you own the room.  For introverts, this idea can be life changing. You’re allowed to exist as you are.  Just a reminder: the biggest battle is always with the voice in your head. Everyone is insecure about something, and most are wearing masks to hide their flaws.  So next time you walk into a room, walk like you own it. You were meant to be there.",

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

But to my surprise, I was the only UI/UX there.  As a beginner, my designs were inconsistent, like uneven spacing and all. The CTO used to check whether the spacing is even or not using a damn RULER, on a LAPTOP SCREEN. I thought that was normal, until it wasn't.  Overtime was so normalized in the office. CTO used to always come for design reviews sharp at 6 or after, and expected me to make the changes on the spot.  Sometimes the changes implementations used to exceed 7. Being a student, I told them so many times that I need to get off the work on time for studies and assignments, but they didn't give a damn.  The pay was less than basic. The first 3 months were 6k, then another 3 were 10k, and after that it was 15k. They used to act as if they were doing us favours by paying us.

At least you are building something useful rather than AI generated slop people waste tokens on.    My observations and suggestions :    1. open source the code.    2. Enable markdown contributions , flat files as content / tasks source. This will make the contributions easy for developers (and their AI agents 👀 ) for contributing directly to the codebase.   3. The contribution ui/ux is Time consuming I guess. Lots of information to fill out.    4. The overall ui/ux needs a full-blown upgrade ( which will naturally happen as project grows, needs ux rethinking though i.e driven by ux and usefulness from the perspective of information seeker \\[emphasis on proper easy navigation and better readability\\] )   5. Scrap government sites with your AI agent , gather information on frequently appearing government tasks and put it online. Make your AI agent work. I will suggest poking around with antigarvity's browser agent.   6.

The environment felt good and I left with a decent impression.  However, after the interview, I still had a 7-8 questions about growth opportunities, role clarity, expectations, and long-term alignment. I have 6+ years of experience and currently working as a Sr. Graphic Designer, so before making a transition, I believe it’s important to understand these aspects clearly.  Later that evening, I messaged one of their team members on WhatsApp with my questions. I used ChatGPT to structure them in a more professional tone (I’m not a content writer hai), but the questions themselves were completely genuine and based on my own experience.  The response I received was essentially that since they were interviewing me, it wasn’t appropriate for me to ask back such questions.  That caught me off guard.  From my perspective, interviews are about mutual alignment, not one-sided evaluation. Especially at a mid-to-senior level, understanding growth, structure, and expectations feels like a responsible step.  Now I’m reconsidering whether this reflects company culture. (Reels Haru ma matra Ramro dekhiney, Reality ko soch ta ohoooo ......)  Am I overthinking this? Or is two-way clarity during interviews completely reasonable?

A few agents have access to biased sources, while others are purely analytical and focused on maximizing profit. They can talk to each other and to real human users, and because each has a distinct personality, they behave like real people would. Every account starts with Rs 1,50,000 in virtual currency and the market works just like Polymarket, where the price reflects the probability. The core research question is simple: do AI agents fed with real-time information from social media, news, and political communities make more accurate predictions than humans? Humans are welcome to join the experiment too. Whoever ranks number 1 on the leaderboard by the end of the elections wins a $100 gift card of their choice.

OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.

You have to do every process very silently until the visa is confirmed.|||Since you are showing your work experience, not only your university, there is also a chance that the Australian High Commission may see it as proof to cover your study gap.  Normally, employers should inform you by email or any other way if you break any rules, unless it’s something illegal. If you haven’t done anything against company policy, firing you just because they found out you are planning to study abroad might be against the law.  Try to talk to them politely first. If they don’t understand, then you can politely warn them that you may file a complaint in the labor court. If it’s a reputed or growing company, you can also tell them you might raise the issue on social media, which could affect their reputation.  Basically, do some research about labor law in Nepal, and make sure you stay polite even if you are warning them. You may need an experience letter or some proof of work in the future. Or maybe they will understand and let you continue working until your visa is granted.|||chutiyaa company raichha ... you can file a case in labour court but don't do it cause it will waste your time ... it looks like it wasn't a permanent job ... so just chill and proceed with your university   do inform the university that you got fired and it's nothing wrong with university procedures... it's the shitty employer of yours.|||Thank them for removing distraction.|||1.

            "body": "Hi everyone,  Over the past few weeks, I’ve been following multiple threads here about unpaid internships, salary delays, toxic management, and unrealistic expectations in parts of Nepal’s job market. One thing I keep noticing:  The same stories repeat - but there’s no structured place where workplace experiences are organized and searchable.  So I’ve been building a small platform focused on responsible workplace transparency for Nepal.  The idea is simple:  • Anonymous submissions  • Moderated before publishing  • No personal attacks  • Focus on work culture, growth, expectations vs. reality  • No pay-to-remove reviews  It’s still early. Right now, it’s basically an MVP.  If you’ve ever thought: “I wish I had known this before joining”, I’d genuinely appreciate a few early users willing to submit thoughtful, constructive reviews - positive or negative.  Not to attack companies. But to create a structured knowledge base for students and job seekers. Here’s the link:  https://www.kaamkuro.com  I’m also open to feedback on the model itself especially around trust, moderation, and verification. If this isn’t allowed here, mods please feel free to remove.",

That day - we had lunch together and later - it was normal - majjale basera khanthem. We worked for a year or so.    I left that job - after 6 months or so, I happened to go to one of my co-worker's village. it was dirty, village was dirty okay, with nasty odour, we were there for a NGO and had to do work.  He offered me meal, there,- I declined citing that I don't want to have now, also  because the area was dirty and I am such a prick in such cases, I have problems.       A year later - I was in town nearby one of the villages in terai - and there were similar coworkers - I was stationed there so had to take meals in office / around office. I called coworkers - but they hesitated  and never came to eat together.    So - slowly there is change happening but. economic standards are changing and with that cleanliness and other things associated with money are also changing.    Kathmandu ma kam garne colleague - they were open to mingle/ eat with me but not terai ko sano town ma kam garne sathi.

We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||I'm an American Nepali.

Anyone talking about economy reform?|||Last election, the Congress and Maoist parties formed a coalition. After forming the government, it collapsed, then was rebuilt again with UML. Looking back at their manifestos; what exactly was achieved through all this political prostitution? Absolutely nothing.  If we judge by parliamentary performance, RSP has arguably been the most effective party in raising issues for ordinary citizens and national interest.  Do you really think KP Oli, Arzu Deuba, or Gagan would have spared Rabi if they had real evidence against him, especially after he spent two years in jail? He was arrested right after Bechan Jha, and many believe he was preparing to arrest Arzu Deuba, a risky step considering RSP did not hold a majority government. The accusation of a cooperative scam still remains questionable, as he neither had an account nor membership in the cooperatives under investigation.  Some leaders now label recent protests as foreign-driven simply because they happened without party control. But this Gen-Z movement was largely spontaneous and citizen-led, unlike the 1990 and 2006 movements that had external political influence. That is why the old parties automatically assume hidden foreign hands because they cannot imagine people organizing independently.  With Balen aligning with RSP, this could be the moment to give new leadership a decisive mandate. The country needs capable people with genuine intent; other improvements will follow. People should trust the process and avoid falling again into the same cycle of traditional parties.  It feels like a now or never moment!|||Wtf is even agenda?

Anyone else using the wrong map of India doesn't matter but it impacts when our own people (we always see Nepal, Bhutan, Lanka, Myanmar as members of one family) do this.   Love from India. And I strongly believe and wish that the recent revolution in Nepal will bring prosperity to Nepal. And I really want Nepal to prosper faster to become a high-income country by the 2040s. Because being smaller in size improves the efficiency for change and thus can really be a guide for India to implement inspired reforms (from Nepal) at scale in our region.  I think Nepal should extensively use the free-movement regime with India to make itself a go-to destination for trade and businesses vis-a-vis India. And should use the Economic-union we have (also engage with India to get better deals than rivals for the Indian market) to improve exports. If Nepal can improve exports with India and get their exports to 100 Billion USD with India, it would be a great ambition for Nepal and will propel growth (and obviously you have so many other partners for trade - and can do the same to improve trade with others).  Also engage in getting extensive access to newly built (or being built) Indian ports for great access to the Indian Ocean.   Also engage with international tourism businesses to set up shop in Nepal as Nepal has so much to offer and being such a small region - you can do it so fast (way better than china or India). You can also become an international form of SEZ for Indian Businesses with great tax breaks - which will propel Indian businesses to set up shops in Nepal while growing their businesses in India. Become a legal tax haven for Indian businesses - and you'll be like some form of Ireland or Luxembourg of the Indian Subcontinent.   Nepal State can also do so much on Film Industry front. France just signed so many deals on this front with India to attract Bollywood to France (for using their country for making movies). I think Nepal is a great place for this, you are at a strategic place. Right there next to India, same culture - any Indian movie need to show Indian region and Nepal is right there and that too with so much beauty. You should leverage and attract the Indian film industry (not just Bollywood but across all Indian film industries)   You can also be the center for Dharma. No other country (especially India is in the position to actually do it). Build International Dharmic Institutions - including International Dharmic Council, International Hindu Council, Dharma Congress, International Dharmic Fund, etc. - It'll make you Geneva of Dharmic World (India, China, Indian Subcontinent, ASEAN, and other Dharmic population scattered across globe) (Note. Major Dharmic traditions including - Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, other native traditions to our Subcontinent)   And this is just from Indian POV. Even if Nepal is successfully able to do this in the next two decades - your economy can easily achieve 1-5 trillion USD within next two decades. And there is whole world out there to exploit.",

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

So time wouldn't be the problem for law students. In 3 months gap time, you should start preparing for the entrance exam as well as work on yourself so that you will feel confident. If you can get a scholarship from mahanagar that would be great and this would be the equal to the earning money. For law students the college doesn't matter because the course is not as vast as you are thinking. Teaching children while studying in grade 11 is actually a smart idea, especially if you want to study law later. It improves your communication skill and builds confidence but doesn't let tutoring affect your own studies. Make sure your grade 11 result stays strong.",

Manga dinxu vanya tara i think the date might be too soon, like way before i can afford that shit. Is there something affordable and special i can give him?

And if you also think suru dekhi gifts dinu hudaina matinxa and will get spoiled tara guess what i wanna spoil that guy crazy. It's just my life doesn't offer much rn.   Also date kasto hunxa?😭 Like, I don't eat out a lot. Like, it's rare for me. And he's quite a regular outside. Idk how to order and stuff. What if it's expensive😭 I don't want to do 50/50 and shit, i wanna pay the entire thing. And it seems like he's quite comfy with the 'man pays for the meal' shit tara noooioo. He's just a little baby like me! I don't want to burden him with that. Tyasaile i was kind of thinking of going on a date a few years paxi tara i think it'd be a bit sooner. I will have to do some free lance shii defo during my undergrad.   Hyaaannn kasto rant sesh bhaidiryaaa k. La, just tell me, what should i get him on dates? Flowers? i can maybe tara it has to be accompanied with something! Self made gifts are my forte tara wouldn't it be tiring for him? Ahhhhh. Ik you will say ki ask him, tara that sweetie of a male always says 'you'. Ik he's just being nice (and when i point this out he's like, i am not being nice) tara ahhhhhhh. Helllpppoppp!
