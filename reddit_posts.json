I will visit Nepal in early March to do the Three Passes trek and enjoy the beauty of your country.|||As a Nepali, I can understand people who protest against too much immigration. The world economy has truly been shaken by COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war. They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||Thanks for your kind words. Do visit when free.|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place? I need to update my list.|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||Appreciate it mate|||australian news always mentions Kathmandu's Mayor Balen whenever they make news about Nepal haha|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

It’s one of my favorite chapters, so I started researching more about it, and realized the way it explains the future of the universe is really outdated. It’s basically still using the old 90s version of cosmology.  **What the books say:**  * **Open universe:** expands forever → Big Freeze * **Closed universe:** expands, then contracts → Big Crunch * **Flat universe:** expansion eventually stops and the universe stays constant in size.  That breaks the law that “nothing in the universe can be at rest.” How tf can the universe itself just freeze?  The problem is that these books are based on research from the **1940s**, before the discovery of **dark energy in 1998**. A universe can’t just “freeze” at a constant size, space itself is dynamic. It either keeps stretching or collapses, but it doesn’t just sit there.  **Modern understanding:**  * **Open universe:** linked with the Big Rip (expansion accelerates until even galaxies, stars, and atoms are torn apart) * **Closed universe:** still ends with the Big Crunch (collapsing back on itself) * **Flat universe:** now connected with the Big Freeze (expansion continues forever, stars die out, galaxies drift apart, everything ends cold and dark)  So yeah, if your book still says “flat universe = constant size,” and the others, that’s outdated. The actual fates of the universe are way more dramatic and different than what we’re taught. Honestly, it’s confusing who to blame for letting students read this outdated stuff!",

I never used one.    7. Can hire horses in Chhepka if you feel tired.   8. Lodging is basic and food is dal, bhat mostly   9. You get snacks such as biscuits and noodles along the way, better to have organic potatoes, as they give you good calories, healthy, tasty and cheaper.   10. Foreigners need permits available at Kathmandu.   11. If you are foreigner, better to take help from one of the trekking agencies in Kathmandu, they will manage the permissions and the fees",

Idk for ntc.|||same problem here i dont talk much|||Recharge your number and transfer balance to somebody who needs to recharge regularly|||Bro thinks companies are for charity. Nepal might be one of the few countries where you have such flexibility of spending.    Be honest, if you can't even spend few hundred in a month (which you spend in chiya churot in a day), why do you subscribe to service?    Also if it was malpractice, unknown terms then looting would be suitable word. This is just everyone's standard clause for buying and using the service.   If you can't afford then just don't buy something. You can stop using their SIM if you don't like the terms they have set.|||If you frequently recharge your sim then the expiry date is not an issue.   I use both NTC and Ncell, I have expiry date of 2027 on NTC and of 2026 August on Ncell.   Edit: Downvoted for saying the truth.|||What you can do is recharge your sim. If you're not using their service, why are you upset they aren't providing their services? Regarding no customer service, it probably has to do with hooligans burning their building",

Even if you didn't completed a year, you can still request it according to your working period at the company.  Labor Act, 2074  Section 37: Entitlement to festival expense: 37(1): Each labor shall be entitled to an amount equal to the basic remuneration of one month as the festival expense each year for the festival to be celebrated according to his or her religion, culture and tradition.  37(2): A labor may make a written request to the employer for the payment of the festival expense referred to in Section 37(1) at one time in one fiscal year on the occasion of the main festival to be celebrated according to his or her religion, culture and tradition. In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   दफा ३७: चार्डपर्व खर्च पाउने  ३७(१): आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति तथा परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने चाडपर्वको लागि प्रत्येक श्रमिकले खाईपाई आएको एक महिनाको आधारभूत पारिश्रमिक बराबरको रकम प्रत्येक वर्ष चाडपर्व खर्चको रूपमा पाउनेछ ।  ३७(२): उपदफा (१) बमोजिमको चाडपर्व खर्च श्रमिकले एक आर्थिक वर्षमा एकपटक आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति, परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने मुख्य चाडपर्वको अवसरमा भुक्तानी लिन रोजगारदाता समक्ष लिखित अनुरोध गर्न सक्नेछ । त्यस्तो अनुरोध नगरेको अवस्थामा प्रत्येक वर्षको बडादशैंमा चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिनु पर्नेछ ।  ३७(३): चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिइने दिनसम्ममा एक वर्ष सेवा अवधि पूरा नभएको श्रमिकले निजले गरेको सेवा अवधिको अनुपातमा चाडपर्व खर्च पाउनेछ ।|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven’t completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha.

            "body": "# I was working on a project using Firebase Studio and needed to use Firebase Storage, which offers 5GB for free. This storage space is sufficient for my needs. However, to use this service, I had to subscribe to the Spark Plan, which is free of charge. But when I tried to create a billing account using my dollar prepaid card from Global-ime Bank, my billing account was instantly suspended.  When I tried to resolve the issue, I received a message saying that Google Cloud couldn't send a verification code to my card. After researching, I found out that Google Cloud doesn't accept prepaid dollar cards.  What can I do to recover my billing account and access the services I need?  Also, is there any chance that Google will start offering its services in Nepal using NPR currency, similar to how they do in India? I heard that Google registered with the Nepal tax system two years ago—could this mean they’re preparing to offer local payment options in the future?",

I plan for this :   lenovo Legion with i7 13650HX,   RTX 4060,   24GB RAM,500GB SSD    available at 150K. This is the best one I could find.  1. I have a little confusion if the RAM is a 16+8=24GB or a 12+12=24GB RAM, as it seems there is no free slot to add more RAM sticks, and how much would it cost additionally to get the config to 32GB by swapping the RAM to 16+16GB and swap the 500GB with 1TB SSD. (same speed). 2. Are there other better deals you could find? please provide the shop name too!

Ive looked on to several career fields here and there, eventually got my eye on UI/UX Design—which will  help enhance my knowledge not just limited to DESIGNS but understanding user psychology and aligning creativity to user needs.   I was planning to do a Masters In Interaction Designs. Then after exploring few universities these degrees are like indulging money just because you can. Its expensive. ( Europe, Australia) These are self learning skills and not the theoretical skills we get in universities.   AI has changed a lot, and will likely replace jobs right? like AI automated many tasks that designers do. And Ui/Ux is a niche one where people dont really realize its importance yet.   I want to self-learn as a beginner and stack up experiences step by step.   What do you think? Will there be a good future? Is there good money? Also do you think studying this course is a good idea?

You should be able to understand code, do design, edit code, should be able to adapt no code, prompt to code, and many more. This might feel overwhelming, but you can start with JUST DESIGN, but should be able to adapt quick.|||As a person who switched from coding to UI/UX myself. I recommend before you do a masters in Interaction Design. Do some UI/UX courses in Udemy. And the most important work as a UI/UX designer professionally for at least a year.  If you still love the work and have passion to learn more then i recommend pursuing a Masters in it as it is not only about designing. Research is 70% of the work. People might love the design part but get frustrated on the product research.|||well not sure in Nepal but there is huge demand of ui/ux in states, its only projected to grow more and demand is even more as AI keeps on accelerating more. good luck",

Good judgment isn’t something they can excel in, at least not yet.  The rational part of a teen’s brain isn’t fully developed and won’t be until age 25 or so.  In fact, recent research has found that adult and teen brains work differently. Adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Teens process information with the amygdala. This is the emotional part.  In teens' brains, the connections between the emotional part of the brain and the decision-making center are still developing—and not always at the same rate. That’s why when teens have overwhelming emotional input, they can’t explain later what they were thinking.

            "body": "Congress Leader Urges Party Workers: “Tell Voters the Money Found at Deuba’s Residence Is Fake”  Kathmandu — A recent controversy inside the Nepali Congress has sent ripples through the political sphere. Senior party leaders have reportedly instructed local cadres and campaigners on how to respond to a sensitive issue that has gained public attention.  According to the directive, the circulating news that “a large sum of money was found at Sher Bahadur Deuba’s residence” should be explained to voters as false and part of a political conspiracy.  During an internal meeting, one leader told the workers: “Our opponents are spreading fabricated propaganda to mislead the people. You must make it clear to voters that this so-called money discovery is nothing but a rumor.”",

Only salaried workers get their salaries after tax deductions. Influencers are like independent contractors, who must pay taxes on all income they receive.

But now she is telling us she made 3 crore in income through brand deals. How much taxes did she pay, considering she claimed to be an honest law-abiding citizen?

Also the brands deduct 15% tds to shirnkhala before making payment so she has to pay 10% additional on the money that she is earning .. All this is valid if she was earning the money as professional and not through any markerting company which influencesrs usually do to plan their taxes",

Who would’ve even thought of setting fire to one of the most prominent government buildings in Nepal? It doesn’t belong to any one politician, it belongs to the whole country. But once you plant an idea in people’s subconscious, it can have ripple effects. It’s kind of like marketing: you don’t really crave a burger until you see an ad, and then eventually, a week or a month later, you go get one. I’m not saying it’s a straightforward cause-and-effect, but this is what happens when a destructive mindset is normalized.|||I’m not supporting Balen or anyone, but aren’t Nepali people self-aware enough to know what’s right or wrong?

Is this truly entertaining or is this dangerous?? Did it somehow set an idea in the subconscious of the GenZs and youths that Singha durbar is nothing just a building once Balen threatened to burn? Why shouldn't I blame him for the destruction of Singha Durbar in some sense if not completely?? I like what he stood for, I like his frustrations, I like his visions that he shows us or pretend to be but is that his real self underneath?? I can't ignore all these things just because people blindly like what he says or cheer for him. I can't ignore the fact that when the whole Kathmandu city was burning Balen didn't even leave the house or not even sent one fire safety vehicles to stop the fire. He could have single handedly stopped all the destruction if he had wanted. Instead he chose to stay inside and throw a post on Instagram. This really makes me sad because he came as our representative as a ray of hope and he's doing this. I can't blindly follow him because he gave us some visions and he just wildly responses to the politicians.|||To be honest, I don’t care what people say about me, and I don’t fucking care if Singha Durbar burns, if the parliament burns, or if the Supreme Court burns. What matters is that 72 potential lives—lives that could have built Singha Durbar, ruled parliament, and led the Supreme Court—were shot dead. And yet, we’re not even sure who interfered in the protest. What amazes me the most is that we seem to care more about the burnt historical buildings than the lost lives, while digging up old posts that someone made years ago. I’m not idolizing Balen—what he said was wrong. But if that’s the case, then what about every indirect statement that politicians make every single day? Nepali haru kati singadurbar mai adkya?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown. At this rate, in next 5-8 years, we will lose our country. Wake up.|||Bro, they already had 12 bude samjauta !!

The problem is we put celebrities on a pedestal, expecting them to be flawless, when they’re just people who can make mistakes.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to “explain her silence” and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they’ve become completely blind to reality. I’m making this post and hoping people don’t fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn’t have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that’s the only privilege she’s ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what “average” really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It’s baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn’t have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, “so be it.” That’s her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted “for no reason” and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she’s misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you’ve benefitted from that influence. That’s not defamation. That’s public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself “self-made.” And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You’re born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can’t even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she’s made so much money, and how people apparently can’t handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that’s why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren’t criticizing you because you’re young and successful. They’re angry because you’re trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because “satya ko saath cha.” That’s when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she’s standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being “satya” while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn’t defend herself, then “the rest of the world will write her narrative.” Again, it’s about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn’t clear her image like that’s the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who “didn’t unfollow her” and those who supported her privately. That’s her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician’s daughter might have given her access others don’t have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a “small-town mindset” while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There’s such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn’t even seem to see it.  She even says “ma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola” and tries to sound reflective, but it’s just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being “not enough.” Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That’s not trolling. That’s responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don’t have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That’s not humility. That’s denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that’s “not an achievement,” and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn’t really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn’t count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn’t keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn’t a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don’t fall for victimized narrative. Please don’t.",

We handed her those privileges because we thought she’d actually speak for us. Instead, she hides behind her husband and drops a manipulative video like nothing happened.

Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win. Kudos to your analysis.|||Yup, it is. We all saw this coming lol Also, most of us predicted that these so called media personalities for eg MISS Oshin whatever is now turning it around to fit their narrative lmao.  Ik you are on reddit OSHIN. You should seriously stfu|||Did not watch the whole video but did she mention about the Nepal Government scholarship that sent her to Harvard?

I am devastated that her childhood home was burnt down, no one should have to experience that. I sympathize with her on that topic. everything else was a narcissist talking without any accountability. There was a post made by her Harvard classmate here a few days ago which really validates the person she is after seeing her videos today.|||Thats exactly what she did when she fumbled in the evening gown round competition in MW. Takka lighting, angle milaaera, trying to victimise herself and putting all the blame to the designer Manish Rai for adding an extra layer of pearl one day before her departure. Oh my god, it was so pretentious. Tyaa dekhi ho yo keti malai mann napareko. I am glad people are seeing for who she is. But still there are comments that support her.|||Well in all fairness, she was never going to turn around and go “yep, I’m embezzling taxpayer funds”  I think the best thing we can do is leave her in the past, not let her have a voice and not support any brands that endorse her.|||Somebody finally said it so beautifully! I couldn’t even continue watching the video after first few minutes. It was torture. Bro like wtf are you talking about?

Pathetic and Diabolical..|||[deleted]|||Request to OP: I have not watched the Excel Kanda at all and i don't plan to. But I would watch or hear your complete breakdown of the whole video even if its 1 hour longer.   Great breakdown. My reasoning to not watch her sob story is the same as yours (at least i believe its similar). I find it repulsive because it seems to have zero validity to the pedestal she was on. From some brief clips, she went to Harvard? How is that simple, humble or average? Internship of her own studies in Spain?? Good for her. Impressive. But addressing all the accomplishments on what is supposed to be her response? I dont get it.|||Why isn’t anyone asking her this? How much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - your income taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about building the country and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes on the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||I watched the video too and disagree. Whatever she is, she is not a criminal. There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

She won many competitions in school , always an A student , won beauty pageant because she deserved it . Not because she was some politicians daughter. The majority of the people didn’t even know who her father is . It’s easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that’s the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 . Her point was that she never lived a luxurious life until she was Miss Nepal , because that’s the truth . Weren’t people blaming her for living off tax payers money ? That’s why she is defending it with proof . When the whole nation attacks you , questions your integrity it’s natural to be defensive . I’m not against you or her , I am just saying she is not going to say 100% of what you all wanna hear . She is human , she gave her reason as to the reason why didn’t speak up as she was targeted with so much hate and rape threats. And the privilege you’re talking about , would have probably agreed with you if you were talking about Jayvir guy.  But why aren’t people targeting him as well . Most of the nepokids or so called elite people don’t even know a world outside of Kathmandu , can’t speak fluent Nepali . People connected with Shrinkhala from the beginning because she spoke like one of us , was grounded . And this whole point of not acknowledging her privilege . What part of privilege she used to win Miss Nepal ? Anybody can participate in the pageant - regardless of who your parents are . It’s easy to pinpoint others, especially a public figure , especially a woman public figure , and you know it’s so easy to spread negativity. And at this time when the whole comment section is flown with negative comments about her , you expect her to say all the Right words , sentences - who are you all ? Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven’t you never made a mistake in your life ? What good are you getting in being so critical of another public figure and expecting her to say all the right things that belongs to your narrative. Nobody is perfect . Time will always reveal the truth . Stop spreading negative. If people wanna like her support her , let them . If you don’t , just stop spreading hate - it only drains you man |||I don't quite know what Gen Z's problem is with Shrinkhala.. we ourselves loved her, we voted for her, we spent our money to send her to international platforms, we cheered for her success. And then she did succeed. She made millions as a result through brands, sponsorships, youtube, etc. If anything she is a smart business woman who capitalized her fame into actual money. Then she got married to the son of Kantipur. She goes on expensive foreign trips with him. She is the daughter-in-law of the most influential media company.  What is really our problem with her? What do we want from her? Are we jealous she became rich and famous? Are we mad at her because both her parents are CPN UML politicians? Are we mad at her for marrying with a rich guy? Are we mad at her because she carried around an expensive label bag? Are we mad at her because she did not single handedly end corruption like she said she wanted to 10 years back in a fucking beauty pageant? What do you want Shrinkhala to tell the world? Yes she is privileged? Yes she married into a well-off family? Yes she went to Harvard?   What is it really?

They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal.

America is still fighting to establish a democracy almost 250 years after it started.  Come election time, find and support candidates that reflect the GenZ values.

Most importantly organize a strong get out the vote program to ensure that those with the most to loose have their voice hear.|||I was born and raised in Nepal until my teenage years before moving to the United States, and it has been over four decades since then. Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas—warriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn’t even facing him. That wasn’t bravery—it was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed—hundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of “justice”—wasn’t justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn’t stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power—the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces—bear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation—if this is the standard of “justice” that today’s youth believe in—then Nepal’s future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger.

The culture and people are nice but you will always be pigeonholed here. Experiencing new culture, being self independent and the journey could be rewarding.   However, it all depends on your financial background, your skillset and courage to step into the world that is full of surprises.

My parents left Nepal when I was too young to make a decision, and I followed them. But the feeling of being back home is unmatched. I have been to many countries throughout the years, made many successes in my career, but nothing matches the feeling of walking in Boudha in the evening...or racing to see a sunset on Poon Hill.   Congratulations on your successes. I hope your life continues to be very rich in experiences and opportunity.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you’re trying to position yourself as “smarter” or “better” than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That’s impressive, but it’s also a privilege many don’t have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn’t about “hype” but it’s about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn’t be possible back home.  So yes, it’s great that you’re making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22.

Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter.

I should have left Nepal a few years before I eventually did.   Going abroad is definitely good and I suggest everyone to do so once in their life time; however, how long to stay is up for debate. I would rather emphasize on THE purpose. I left Nepal because I couldn't stand to live in Nepal. I am poorer than the most of my old friends who stayed in Nepal.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Balen ko party ma “ dudh le nuhayeka” manxe aaun subhakamana xa mero😂, but sad thing balen le party hakna sakdaina and i guarantee he won’t be pm|||Good going on",

The world economy has truly been shaken by COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war. They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people.

As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||Appreciate it mate|||australian news always mentions Kathmandu's Mayor Balen whenever they make news about Nepal haha|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

While I don't support yemale, maobadi -- they are as neoliberal or more than congress-- using this to attack on the communism as ideology is also unfair. Just like you can not judge Gen Z for some hijacking their protest, you can also not judge communism because imperialist forces are also hijacking any attempt of a communist state. There are also several nuances -- of course USSR - say a *proper* implementation gave rise to famine (holodomar) and a lot of bloodshed, it also improved the lives of regular peasants. I was reading the accounts of the family who moved from absolute shanks to one bedroom apartments. Plus, there can be a lot of concessions and modifications -  like China for example moved it's modality to state sponsored capitalism -- of course it's a surveillance state and state is overarching (one child policy) but the improvement in standard of living and progress in society (healthcare and education) is out there. And also to blame famine and bloodshed in communism is also seeing reality with only one tainted lenses -- potato famine in Ireland, Churchill's starvation of Bengalis).

The choice of taking the path of socialism vs capitalism is like not choosing brands of chocolate, but it's like a choice between monarchy and modernity. They are not on the same plane. Capitalism was revolutionary compared to feudalism at the time, but everyone's material conditions around the world today are deteriorating real fast because of profit > people and many are coming to the same conclusion either by learning or economic desperation. This is why fascism is on the rise to \"bring back order\" to a failed system riddled with core contradictions that cannot be reconciled.   Freedom under capitalism is freedom for capital owners, it doesn't work if everyone has a basic level of economic security by virtue of access to means of production.

Nepal is truly blessed with low iq goodness.|||I'm a pro capitalist myself, but here's my take on why this is the case in Nepal (copied from another post of mine):  You see the problem with rich in the context of Nepal (and any underdeveloped nation) is that being filthy rich out of nowhere is almost always impossible. This is because in an underdeveloped economy, there isn't much consumer needs that you can solve which creates more value which makes you rich. The economy and society isn't sophisticated enough.  So, most of the rich people you see are mostly old money folks who were close to the monarchy, who got rich from the new political system, and that compounded with them owning land in the most important parts of the country.  Now, a select few being able to magically earn more (due to the land value appreciation) sitting idle while rest of the country has to work hard to earn some fraction of that is unfair, irrational, and unsustainable from a system design perspective.  This is contrary to what happens in a developed nation like America, where anyone can go and establish a billion dollar business by figuring out an emerging need and solving for it in the mesh of that sophisticated and good spending society.|||The earlier people in their 20s realize that communism doesn’t actually exist, the better. Many think calling themselves communist is cool, philosophical, and a stand for equality, but the truth is that communism has only ever lived in theories, never in real practice.

            "body": "A week ago, I commented on a post that my Instagram friend shared. It was about people raising concerns regarding the constitution. The post was originally made by some guy who happens to be an editor at RONB. His perspective was that we could appoint Sushila Karki as the Prime Minister of Nepal in the same way Khilraj Regmi was appointed in 2061. He was sure that it’s still possible without compromising the constitution—which I seriously doubt.  I commented that it was the Interim Constitution that allowed such provisions, but our 2072 Constitution clearly states that it’s not possible. I suggested that there might be other ways to achieve something similar. My friend, who happens to be blindly faithful toward RONB, texted me and lashed out: How can you say such things? How do you even have this kind of knowledge? Who taught you to talk like this? You don’t know shit, and you don’t know better than the editor of RONB.  At that very moment, I was angry, but I still tried to make her listen to the audio text I sent, where I explained some alternatives. She wasn’t ready to listen or even consider another perspective. I mean, the audacity of that bitch—she blocked me without even hearing my point of view. Who does that?  And the most annoying part is that she unblocked me exactly on the day Sushila Karki became PM, just to share the RONB post with me, of course, and texted “bhedaa” along with some other shit—then blocked me again. Like, what the actual fuck? Does she even realize it wasn’t the “Khilraj way” that Sushila became PM?  I don’t usually do this, but she really crossed the line here.",

There is precedent of parliamentary procedures being bypassed after revolution.  There is a concept called doctorine of revolutionary legality. This is not a first time a revolution has happened and main demands of the revolution are contradictory to the provisions as per supreme law/constitution of that nation.  End of apartheid in South Africa, Independence of India, America these directly contradicted the constitution at that time. Panchayat system made parties illegal in Nepal revolution happened against that and Birendra accepted multiparty democracy. Bolsheviks revolution of Russia and french revolution both were against constitutional provisions of that time. Most revolution that overthrow authoritarian government like Philippines and Arab spring went against the provisions of then constitution.   Sovereignty of people ultimately supercedes constitutional provisions. People themselves are the ultimate source of law. Constitutions themselves can be scrapped if it contradicts popular sovereignty.   That being said the person speaking in the video raises good points and he doesn't seem to be spreading misinformation intentionally its just that the door he thinks are closed are not necessarily closed it is entirely possible that next election will choose directly elected PM but for that president has to support it. The provisions mentioned in the constitution can be bypassed because this is an extraordinary circumstance and legality of ignoring constitutional provision comes from revolution itself it's the will of people.   After election the courts can legitimize it after the fact on basis of doctorine of necessity as those procedure/unconstitutional changes although not allowed as per constitution were the needed to protect sovereignty vested in people and was the demand of people. There is precedent and this has been done.   The big problem there is obviously possible foreign interference.   Another strong point this person makes is that an agreement should have been made. even now with interim PM an agreement summarizing demand and demanded changes can be made that agreement will have legality by revolution.

Why would the hon ones ever agree to that?  The voice reached there through the protests so can’t the President directly pass an ordinance or bill to amend these rules?

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help spray fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly. Make community run 3D printers (like a library, a public property for an entire community) a common sight in Nepal rather than just a strange novelty technology.

Even if you didn't completed a year, you can still request it according to your working period at the company.  Labor Act, 2074  Section 37: Entitlement to festival expense: 37(1): Each labor shall be entitled to an amount equal to the basic remuneration of one month as the festival expense each year for the festival to be celebrated according to his or her religion, culture and tradition.  37(2): A labor may make a written request to the employer for the payment of the festival expense referred to in Section 37(1) at one time in one fiscal year on the occasion of the main festival to be celebrated according to his or her religion, culture and tradition. In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   दफा ३७: चार्डपर्व खर्च पाउने  ३७(१): आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति तथा परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने चाडपर्वको लागि प्रत्येक श्रमिकले खाईपाई आएको एक महिनाको आधारभूत पारिश्रमिक बराबरको रकम प्रत्येक वर्ष चाडपर्व खर्चको रूपमा पाउनेछ ।  ३७(२): उपदफा (१) बमोजिमको चाडपर्व खर्च श्रमिकले एक आर्थिक वर्षमा एकपटक आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति, परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने मुख्य चाडपर्वको अवसरमा भुक्तानी लिन रोजगारदाता समक्ष लिखित अनुरोध गर्न सक्नेछ । त्यस्तो अनुरोध नगरेको अवस्थामा प्रत्येक वर्षको बडादशैंमा चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिनु पर्नेछ ।  ३७(३): चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिइने दिनसम्ममा एक वर्ष सेवा अवधि पूरा नभएको श्रमिकले निजले गरेको सेवा अवधिको अनुपातमा चाडपर्व खर्च पाउनेछ ।|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven’t completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha. One month basic remuneration maatra ho dine full one month salary haina.

We got 1.5x of our salary.|||It's not a bonus, it's an allowance. Bonus is dependent on company performance, allowance is not. All employees are entitled to the festival allowance. It's not specific to just Dashain and not even called Dashain allowance. If you are not a Hindu or do not celebrate Dashain you can ask the company to provide you the allowance at other times of the year.|||Labor Act le nei bhandeko cha, sabeile comply garnu parcha.

But building a company quickly showed me a bigger picture. A founder isn’t just a coder you’re a communicator, a coordinator, a salesperson, a project manager. Investors, clients, and teammates don’t care only about elegant code; they care whether you can explain a product in clear English, align a team, and keep promises.  Here’s the mindset shift that hit me hard: \t•\tTechnical intelligence builds the product. You need the skills to create something real. \t•\tEmotional intelligence sells it. You need the skills to talk to customers, handle conflict, and inspire a team. \t•\tEffort multiplies both. No matter how smart you are, the person who keeps showing up and doing the hard, uncomfortable work will outpace you.  Whenever you avoid the call, the pitch, or the awkward conversation because it’s “not your thing,” that’s a signal your emotional intelligence needs reps just as much as your coding skills do.  If you want to build a great tech startup, you can’t pick one side. You need to build and you need to sell. Period.",

Don’t stress about Linux, it’s pretty easy to get used to, and honestly, once you do, you might not even go back to Window. You can find multiple tutorials on YouTube for Linux installation. Search for \" How to dual boot Windows and (your preferred linux distro)\". You can remove Windows once you are comfortable with Linux, if you want.  3. If you can spend a bit more, upgrade the RAM. Use two sticks of the same size to take advantage of dual channel.  With this setup, you’ll have a solid dual-boot laptop running both Linux and Windows.

            "body": "Context: Back in 2023, I jumped into this \"SEO\" thing for my startup because I thought, “hey, this can’t be that hard.” I just have to write some good blogs, add a few \"targeted keywords\" in the content, send emails to few prospect for \"link building\" and then BOOM Google will show my site in the first page.  Nope. Not even close.  I spent months publishing content (more than 20+ articles) I thought they were amazing. But when I checked Google? Page 10. Page 12. Basically invisible. And every time I tried to ask “why isn’t this ranking?” most answer I got from SEO gurus was mostly the same two words:  “Your Content is good, but SEO TAKES TIME\"  And then, of course, the golden advice: “Just build quality backlinks.”  Okay… but what does that actually mean?  How many backlinks do I need?  \"SEO TAKES TIME\" okay, but exactly how long specifically for my target \"keyword\" I want to rank for?  And getting backlinks from what kind of sites is good enough to be considered as \"high quality backlinks\" purely for my targeted keyword?  And how the hell do I guest post without spamming “keyword + write for us” into Google and begging random sites for guest posts?  That’s when it hit me: what if there was a tool that didn’t just say “build quality backlinks,” but literally broke it down for you? Like Google saying  “To rank for this keyword, you’ll need around 42 backlinks from DA 28-32 sites, you site MUST LOAD under 2.5 seconds, have 3 supporting articles, and ~4 months of consistency. Oh, and here’s the exact strategy to actually get those backlinks without generic guest posting BS.”  So… I built it.  It’s called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com). It’s a tool where you type in your target keyword (for example: “best AI tools in 2025”), and it tells you:  How many backlinks you’ll realistically need  What domain authority range those backlinks should come from  How long it’ll probably take to rank  What technical fixes you need to make  And most importantly → the strategy to actually hit those requirements  I’m not saying this magically gets you to Page 1 overnight (SEO is still work). But at least now you can start with clarity instead of guesswork with Pikera SEO.  Right now, Pikera SEO is in early access, and we’re running a waitlist here: https://pikeraai.com/waitlist.  If you’re a founder, marketer, or just someone tired of SEO “it depends” answers, I think you’ll find it useful.  But I’d also love your feedback: if you were using a tool like this, what’s the #1 thing you’d want it to tell you about your keyword? Because I’m still improving it, and honestly, hearing from people in communities like this is way more valuable than any \"SEO guru’s\" advice.  That’s it. Just wanted to share my journey, my frustration, and what I built out of necessity.  If anyone’s been through the same SEO pain, I’d love to hear your story too.",

Its like that the notification permission is on so something like offer or anything the app gives it will display what is the harm on that??  You give permission to google/apple or any other apps so it is not a big issue..  If you are scared of privacy just use the phones with no network access..",

I was going out of valley so I thought it would be a good idea to buy earbuds and I freaking paid 3800 for it and it stops working after just 2 damn days. I haven't even used it much, I only used it to listen music when I was traveling in microbus and lord and behold the stupid think stops working midway. I did contact the customer service and they replied they'll replace or repair it if it's with warranty guidelines but I'm not returning to KTM anytime soon and what if the warranty does cover it is my 3800 gone just like that. It feels so frustrating that something I bought with my hard earned money just stops working after just 2 days.  I should have just sticked to ultima it's way reliable.",

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image. That’s not just tone-deaf, it’s calculated. The timing, the fake vulnerability, the “I’m innocent” narrative, it’s all image management. And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It’s actually disgraceful. Her silence during the peak of the movement spoke volumes, and now this video just confirmed everything people feared about her. Honestly, if this is the “final boss” of playing victim, it’s a pathetic one.|||Tyo excel sheet banauna plan gareko PR team lai fire hannei parxa Shrinkhala le😂😂|||Feels like Nepal ma kei garnu bekar ho.  Tetro 72+ le jyan gumayo but nata uniharu le justice pauxa nata kei hunxa .

Fuck y'all|||Indian news ko thumbnail banauchau kyaho timi|||I was like, nahh she’s too conceited to shoot herself. And then I read the rest lol|||Yeah, absolutely disgusting that she remained silent during the protest, not a word about the martyrs or speaking up for Gen-Z. The video just spoke me me me me me. Look at me. Oh woe is me. It would have been nice if she showed support to the movement, and later clarified from her perspective after things settled down but this is waaay too soon. Honestly, all I see is her self-centered behaviour.|||Shrinkhala has ruined her own reputation. She could have just stayed silent and people would have forgotten her.

I got a sudden boost in heart-beat thinking she actually shot herself & unlived her|||Hijo matrai I saw a YouTube video of thesadiapsychology’s scam who provides everything but proof that she is a licensed psychologist with degrees. It’s a different story but that’s exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala’s videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It’s one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we’re dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it’s not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it’s not easy, but it’s part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she’s only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||More the explanation more the lie.|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more. If she had all the receipts ,  she could have confronted these allegations and spoke out about corruption then but nope..she made a video about her sorry state.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her? I have read somewhere that people hate her now because she said she will fight against corruption when she is the daughter of Binod Khatiwoda so that made her a hypocrite. Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||K garos ta garna chai, yeti sab vaisakdaa, yeti sab accusations huda, euta manche le aafno clarification ta dihalxha ni yr.

            "body": "I know we already have too many posts on her. I know we are trying to make her irrelevant now. But there are still people who are supporting her, because sabai kura easily trust garna mildaina especially when it's mostly allegations. Gossips lai prove garna ni sakinna. Pls read until the end.  So, recently Tiktok ma ekjana le Shrinkhala ra Shambhav ko total 9 jana ko group le Shey phoksundo ma Army ko helicopter bata 'rescue' ko naam lidai misuse gareko witness gareko bhanyo. They said majjale ramairako, hasirako thyo re yo 9 jana ko group, ani helicopter aayera lagyo re. News portals ma ni news bhetincha rescue gareko bhanera. Malai chai valid proof nai chahirathyo pattyauna. Given how she has been portraying herself through social media and PR videos, it was time we start questioning their misuse of power.   I wanted to see pictures of that 'rescue' operation. Having some free time, I did some internet digging and found a facebook page of Nepal Army posted on October 2023. It exactly matches the news portals and tiktok user's claim, plus Shrinkhala’s story(it's on her story highlights). Yes, Summit air use gareko vlog cha, but my guess is ktm to dolpa jana lai use gareko ho, not return to ktm.   Picture: collage of the picture on fb page of Nepal army, then Shrinkhala’s group of 9 people who went to Shey Phoksundo. Luga haru milcha, anuhar ni milcha. You can see that it's the same group.   This really shows how much power is misused in Nepal and the recent nepo-kids trend was helpful to shed light on this. I am also against all the opportunists who posted against their exes to gain relevancy during vulnerable times. Aba chahi we should think twice before blindly following social media figures.",

Well, the rescue could have been genuine. Because anyone can get sick at any point at a high altitude, and maybe one of them broke an ankle or went out of breath.  Which could have happened just after the laughs they had or they were lighting up the mood.   We become too judgemental too quickly. And because the nepo kid trend went on, this incident invovling her was brought to light. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a genuine ask for help, and the rescue was conducted safely by Nepal army.|||Anpad gawar janta ho...the helicopter is not free..they pay for it (either the rescused people or the insurance)..the army uses these helis for commercial purpose to earn money.

So all her friends who worked with her who called her out were true. Engineering ma naam na niskeko ani Architecture ma 3rd list ma naam niskeko. Her Pulchowk project being paid and done by someone else, asking for help from classmates here and at Harvard, not a single thing was done by her and having the audacity to take credit for other’s teamwork.   Topper hoina one semester ko project ma aru ko kaam present garera winner bhaeko ho. Always knew she is faking being an intellectual but this is diabolical. Everyone needs to watch this! She emphasized she is a topper at Miss Nepal or Miss World platform. Unbelievably embarrassing!  Her entire family sees nothing wrong with recalculating board exam. Harek exam ma kasari fail huncha ani recalculate garauda high scores tyo ni 91 lyaera Engineering ma kasari naam na niskeko ta?

If normal kids pull off this kind of shit, our parents would have been the first ones to straighten us out. Hamlay bidroh gareko bhaye dui jhapad khaisakthyau.  This needs to go viral for accountability. Her words and actions don’t match at all and she is playing with people’s future since she was young. Imagine the people who actually deserved the seat but were denied because of her. This is so unfair and worry some!

She really is not as intellectually gifted as she portrays herself to be. She seems to surrounds herself with people who are actually intelligent (and hence pass off their work as her own) and her family is well connected and powerful enough to give her things she could never earn by merit. OR 2. Her family is CORRUPT enough for certain people to have a personal vendetta against her and deliberately tried to ensure her results are tempered with. Eventually her family had to do some private investigations and ensure her career is not impacted by such dirty political games...which just proves her family is corrupt and had immense political influence.   Either way, there is no winning here. She is still a liar, a hypocrite and a narcissist.|||do u mean she inflated her results misusing parent's political power? |||Shrinkhala took \"Fake it till you make it\" way too seriously|||Now i can confirm the earlier reddit post of one of her classmates of Harvard, she exposed how shrinkhala is not as intelligent as she presents to be.|||She was not batch topper usle final project ra thesis ma top gareko ho.my friend was studying architecture in pulchowk at that time and she told me she was not batch topper.

We need to share this and let people know how did this pathetic person misused power while she legitimately failed her exams and so many youth committed suicide because they were not even given this privilege, or even their voice were unheard for retotaling after the exam. Lets share this video and see what does shrinkhala lovers has to say. She is so opportunistic and selfish and its so sad to see people actually believe her.|||This ability to re-total is a privilege. She will never accept that it is  There must be Countless more privileges that led her to have the life that she has. Acknowledge it, drop the I'm self made act.

Back in my SLC, I was shocked to see an ‘E’ in Health & Population. Even after re-totaling, nothing changed. Then, my mom and I went all the way to Sano Thimi for rechecking and guess what?

If we continue to leg pull , gossip and stop questioning the system we are very much alike the generation you are pointing fingers at. There is a quote that states \" Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people\". I really hope Nepal does not end up being the country full of small minds. Come on guys, we are better than this.  And FYI,  Exam withheld doesnot necessarily mean person has failed the exam.  FYI, corruption stops via a good systemic change. Mere influncers are not the one responsible to end corruption. IT IS THE SYSTEM!|||Kati thulo issue banako dimag navako vede haru.

Many students do this alongside studies. Also, there are free resources online (YouTube, Khan Academy, NMC prep channels) that can help you push your score higher without paying for classes. Even I worked as a part time waiter after my SEE and I was working plus studying +2 to make some extra cash to support my family.. No job is small or big, try to work wherever you can for some extra cash.. start seeking for job, go to nearest restaurants, coffee shops, other businesses, someone would definitely be hiring..  If scholarship doesn’t work out this year, remember MBBS is not the only path, Loksewa and many other options can still give you a secure future. But for now, your priority should be your safety and health. Please reach out to a close friend, a teacher, or even counseling services if you ever feel like giving up. You don’t deserve to carry this pain alone.  You’ve already proved you have the talent and resilience, just keep going step by step. Things can change and will definitely change|||Proof me maximum as you mentioned here , if you do so I will help you atleast NPR 10K|||Not to demotivate you bahini, but I think Loksewa is the best option for you now.

Ani, timile tuition padhayera bhaye ni garchhu ta sochauli, but it’s quite hard to manage time. My parents are providing me money for my expenses, but I am still mentally fked up because of MBBS.  Anyway, it’s your future. Do what feels best for you. Good luck!|||Dear baini, I am a doctor myself and seeing your financial conditions and no support system it will be very hard for you to pursue an MBBS journey even if you get a scholarship. MBBS is a long and tough journey and requires a good support system from your family for at least 6 years if you do well. And trust me it is not as lucrative as it seems from outside. A lot of your youth and family money goes into it even in scholarship. From my perspective, It's better for you to do some income earning work and take your study side by side( which is not possible in MBBS ,kapal njharunjel dedicated vayera padnu parcha to be a doctor). Euta part time job khojihala. Kaam lai thulo sano navana. Right now the main issue you have is economic.

Sometimes we just have to accept the situation, ghati herera had nilnu bhaneko jastai. Right now your focus needs to be on finding a job and probably a roommate that you can share your rent expenses with. And just cut off all the contacts with your mother asap. She has mental issues probably bipolar or something, it's not your job to fix it. She brought you into this mess and it was her responsibility to take care of you, not yours to take care of her. So just cut off all the contacts and find a job.

Since you know your financial situation and your overall situation padhna vanda ni kaam khojna important xa hola ni hai, ani since you are a bright student you can give home tution, and earn some money. 5yr mbbs garera last ma you will get internship ma 15 20k, ani tespaxi MO ma 30 40k 6th year ma. You see time it will take for you to just get started even then? On the other side what you can do is, start working, and may be start applying to US universities since you have a story and good academics you can get scholarship with stipend.  I know its easier said than done, but apply garna paisa lagdaina ani decision auda samma if you give some tution or start teaching you can collect some money for visa interview.

MBBS is a really hectic field and it’s not like you imagine it to be. Aile timro financial condition herda, it’s better if you try for Loksewa, as you’ll get results and earn money way faster than MBBS. MBBS takes at least 4 and a half years , teti bela samma you won’t even earn a penny. You’ll start to earn a bit of money during internship as a stipend.  Also, the mental pressure in these 4 and a half years is too much. Endless classes, practicals, weekly exams sabai le stress dincha. If you’re thinking of taking tuition classes or doing a side job, then it’s really hard to do so for straight 4 and a half years.  Unless someone else is helping you out financially, it’s really hard. Ki ta timile IOM ma naam nikalnu parcha, natra it’s quite hard without any financial support.  It’s your future, so make the decision wisely. I'm always rooting for you!

Dropper raixau bhane paxi you might be well aware about the scholarship scheme. 140 over score gareu bhane you'll be eligible for open category scholarship (but it depends on cut off and highest score) Tara government school 6 or tyo bhanda aagadi dekhi padheko bhaye 120 or even 100 over matra lyauda ni you'll be eligible for scholarship female, indigenous category Bata. All in all I think you'll get a scholarship seat.  Fyi, I'm a mbbs student currently on 2nd semester. Talking as a med student myself, timle mbbs join garexi job garxu bhanni aas chai narakhda hunxa.. it'll be very hectic. With exams coming up every 2 weeks, the practical files you have to do, the content you have to study, these will keep you occupied enough.

Yetti expenses Ani stress dhanna sakxau bhane (which I think you can) MBBS won't be a big deal Tara side job ko almost no chance.   Lastly, what I genuinely think is you shouldn't aim for mbbs, rather you can try for other streams and do a side job to support your mom. MBBS is not all that. You can achieve a lot through other sectors also. You've gone through all of this Ani on top of that you seem to be very talented so I think you'll thrive on every stream you end up on. At the end of the day, it's your decision. Do what you think is best for you but remember SUICIDE AIN'T YOUR ONLY OPTION!|||More power to you baini. Wishing you all the very best. can't help financially, kei advice chahiye or if you need someone to talk to you can dm me|||Be strong and do what you need to get there, I also can help you thorbahut.|||Sister, I cannot help financially but I read your story. I thought I had a tough situation but yours shattered me. Please do not let it break you. Please don't let yourself be broken by this. You may cry but don't let it take you any unfortunate action.   I suggest you pursue something else instead of MBBS as MBBS is very draining and as much as I've heard very stressful study and also the job you get from it is believed to be very stressing. I am aware it is a noble job but you have to care about yourself. Know that there is always a very good chance of being loved. Don't lose hope. You would get specific advices from other fellows here but pls don't let it all break you. Loneliness decays a person from inside I understand. Focus on getting independent enough to live a decent enough lifestyle for now. Food, shelter, clothes, walk.  MBBS will take too much from your mental strength.  If you ever feel like it is getting too heavy. Know that you are open to cry but not break. It is not a permanent rut. You will get through this. Have trust in yourself. Never lose that trust. Even if you do, seek it back. Snatch it back. Get it back again. I really wish for your better.  - An anonymous brother|||ma sanga testo helpful advice xaina but if kosailai afno man ko kura bhanuxa bhane u can message me  ani I think , timro main problem paisa ko ho aela ko lagi so , kei skills haru xa bhane freelancing haru try hana, especially programming , editing haru aauxa bhane dherai ramro xa  or insurance bechera commission aaune pani is a good way thori paisa kamaune , esma dherai kei garnu pardaina just timro sathi or relative le timro marfat insurance kinyo bhani u get paid a bit  lastly tension na leu , when u are  at the bottom tyo bhanda aja tala jane batai hudaina , so aba timro akash ma jane pali aaudaixa  ani u can message me if u want get stuff out of ur heart|||Broooooooo kapilvastu dekheraa mann nai chiso bhayoo|||Lamo....

            "heading": "Mahesh Basnet is about to Host mass murderer K.P. Oli in Bhaktapur at his House!",
            "body": "Mahesh Basnet the absolute piece of shit, is bringing the child-murdering psychopath and failed autocrat K.P. Oli into my village, probably to host him in his home \"under his protection\", in Suryabinayak-7, Gundu, Bhaktapur. This here now is not just politics at this point, this is an insult to everyone who lives here. I feel ashamed, but more than that, I am boiling with anger. How can I stay silent while my own ground is being used to glorify these criminals?  I will not just swallow it. This is my home, my people, and I refuse to let Mahesh Basnet walk around unchecked, parading his power. That is why I am speaking out now, to tear the mask off Basnet and show everyone the filth he hides behind. We will revolt against him, louder and harder than ever, because he is more dangerous than many of the other goons we curse in whispers..  While one must be careful not to hold family members responsible for the actions of another, the active support this dogshit-Basnet receives from his son, a law student, raises questions of complicity, especially in light of dogshitman-Basnet's increasingly volatile public behavior and serious allegations against him.  **Corruption and Unexplained Wealth**  Recently, while insulting the martyrs of our nation's protests, Mahesh Basnet had the audacity to claim he was clean and challenged anyone to investigate him. This is an empty challenge. His wealth is obviously not in his name and kasle garne yesko investigation. This is a man who has never held a real job outside of being a party karyakarta or a minister of industry in recent times, yet he owns multiple houses. His son, also without a job, travels internationally, stays in luxury hotels, and flaunts a lifestyle far beyond their legitimate means.  Here in Gundu, his influence is everywhere. He allegedly owns the \"Yoyo\" Banquet, the \"Yoyo\" Zipline (famously visited by Prachanda), and a \"Yoyo\" Resort currently under construction. Where did the money for these massive establishments come from?? We all know the answer, even if we can't prove it . This is why a thorough, independent investigation into his assets is long overdue.  [Some of Mahesh Basnet's son's foreign travel with taxpayers money.](https://preview.redd.it/fhumen39mqpf1.jpg?width=3171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d989806f81112829eabfeeb7bb71323fb598c6bd)  https://preview.redd.it/2idrjmhnmqpf1.png?width=1357&format=png&auto=webp&s=e19d2338012fc2cab3c296cabfc4bd17498048d1  https://preview.redd.it/v8yfebydnqpf1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d5b95ffd59ede1665dbcbde9d62a05e26e23ad6  [Yoyo Resort in Construction process, just few 100 meter below  yoyo zipline.](https://preview.redd.it/w7ynwh9aqqpf1.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2088fd7ef085aafa3cf392745d88ba3755bb1c18)  **Why the People of Gundu Are Silent**  Friends from outside often ask, \"Why don't you just throw him out?\" It's not that simple. Gundu is a close-knit community, which becomes a curse in situations like this. To stand against a powerful man supported by a network of loyalists means becoming an outcast.  Need something from the ward office? The staff are in his pocket, infact some of the emplyoee are his close relatives and the oda karyalay ko chief is friends with him and calls for his \"blessing\" for any matter.    Driving down the street? The local police might stop you for no reason just for inconvinienc-ing you. His network of beneficiaries, people who got government jobs thanks to his influence, will turn their backs on you. Local shops may refuse to sell you goods. His army of goons, made up of the village's own jobless youth, patrol the streets and will not hesitate to harass or assault you.  Just days ago, a young man from our village was caught livestreaming a protest against Basnet. He was  branded a \"traitor to the village,\" and ostracized. Even my parents were talking about the guy like how people talk about Naruto in his village lol. Fucking hell.  That is why I cannot protest openly. I do not want to become a martyr for a cause that will be crushed before it even begins because no one here will stand with me. The youth who should be fighting for change are mostly party loyalists.  **Conclusion**  The silence from Gundu is not consent; it is a product of a carefully constructed system of fear and dependency. As a resident who feels unable to protest safely, I am using this platform as my voice. The hosting of K.P. Oli by Mahesh Basnet is not merely a political gathering; it is a demonstration of impunity. It is a signal that individuals facing serious allegations of corruption and violent crime can continue to operate in the highest echelons of power. This is not a local issue, it is a national concern that demands attention and action from all who believe in justice, accountability, and the rule of law. These clowns need to be behind the bar.  https://preview.redd.it/4eccc725xqpf1.jpg?width=574&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bb0a56948c40fc1347e36ec4385c13120c66af6  https://preview.redd.it/0mspnu0gxqpf1.jpg?width=1670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a5cd841240e66a776f10978672455f189c61581  [Prachanda doing zipline in Yoyo Zipline owned by Mahesh basnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpp0MzgQB3U)  [Calling genz terrorist](https://www.facebook.com/MaMaheshBasnet/videos/2664565070548857)  [Basnet's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MaMaheshBasnet/)  [Rape Allegation](https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/rape-foeticide-complaint-lodged-against-mahesh-basnet)  [Kidnapping allegation](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/police-refuse-to-register-fir-against-ex-minister-basnet-ex-igp-khanal-ruling-party-lawmaker-shrestha-for-the-alleged-abduction-of-opposition-lawmaker)  [Publicity stunt at reinventing police station](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1455707989093360) (The guy in teal shirt is the police chief here and yet everyone has to bow down to Dogshit man, shows the power dynamic in this place)",

I was like, \"Yo baney si tw kya ramro view aaucha hola hai tya bata.\" After knowing its reality, no matter how good the view is, I don't want it, man.     My brother had also said, 'talai taha cha tyo Mahesh Basnet ko gundu ho', and now I know why he said 'Mahesh Basnet ko gundu' today.  Much power to you, brother, for bringing this out.

I don't live there anymore but I still have people I care about there. So I'm absolutely infuriated about this news. This isn't just about KP Oli being corrupt anymore, his politics has put our whole town in jeopardy. Obviously so many people will try to attack and vandalize KP's residency and our town will get caught in the crossfire. It's gonna be very very dangerous for anyone living there.  I dunno if people of the community can organize a protest against that because even if you support CPN-UML this is a very bad move. It's not about political leaning anymore it's about the security of the community despite political leaning. I am trying to educate and make people aware about this to as many people I know as much as possible. But since I actually don't live there I dunno if people will realize this and come together to protest this.|||I don't ever pray bad for anyone but for some worse than stool-worms KP,Mahesh, Prachandey,I heartly curse them.

We must hold institutions accountable and ensure that no other family is forced to endure the same pain and silence.  Let us honor Nirmala’s memory not with silence, but with action.

If we relax now, those who thrive on chaos and corruption will try to regain ground. Vigilance, regular citizen oversight, and strong pressure for transparency are needed at every step. The sacrifices made in this movement must be honored by making sure accountability and reform actually reach every corner of the new system.

India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there. If he just sits in his office chair waiting mindlessly while everybody is reaching him out to take a step then its alarming, is he really a possible prime minister candidate?? doubt huna thalchha, veda harlai feri yo bhanda pachdaina, he has some done good things too as a mayor but idk has he not abandon us when we needed him most? Aba desh ko yo awasta ma he is not a good leader anyways, pachhi aba j hunchha dekha jayega. Hope we rise again from the ashes.|||Balen is just a hype, he has never been a mayor of citizens; he is mayor of RONB; if there was no RONB, he would never have existed!|||Ony the strong system maketh the county!

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out.

I mean yesterday when trying to choose a representative for GenZ nai testai vayo, everyone questioning everyone, representative candidates fighting with each other, and mind you there were less 1000 people there. Went to another server, same thing there. And of course no common interest in these two channels as well. I did raise that concern since everyone was fighting, in the chat because no one was ready to listen, just shout, that there are thousands of people who were involved, even if someone did get elected in that very server, what's to say others who were not there will follow. I left after that, have not joined it today. I see representatives of GenZ already doing interviews elsewhere so what is the point here. Also I refrain myself of any opinions since I have absolutely zero knowledge on any politician or their views or visions or nothing, but was just there to see who got elected and what was the conclusion.|||Mujii “Gen z movement “ itself fundamentally wrong xa, monarchy maan paraune pani gen z xan uniharu ko kura sunnupardaina?

They play revolution like a video game shielded at home, fed by parents, but clueless about real struggle or sacrifice.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

Prachandey already started plans the move of jail, the panick of oli to ban social media.  Everything is a blur now.  OLI got the message somehow and left sherey probably didn't.  September 8 at least 50% unrelated moles enter protest incite violence the police plays along then came the ones using actual bullets.  September 8 nighttime every single one of thugs for hire was paid to do organized premeditated almost military level planned attacks.  Sep 9 they straight up start attacking ( high rank officials usually have a ton of armed police and stuff which cannot be seen anywhere )  The lack of police on the streets says a lot maybe the ones holding the guns are the police working for prachandey or some other forces , most of the ones holding guns knew how to use it straight away so. .  The lamichane escape with freeing criminals as a distraction was nicely orchestrated.     Nepal is now in another chaos  If maoists and rsp do not come clean of this they should be hunted like pigs they are.|||Lets not be idealist :We need one caretaker prime minister .And rabi is the only choice .k chai dirty politics garyo rabi le?

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.

The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!

Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||keep exposing|||Am I the only one who cant believe that she got 3 crore just from collaborating with brands. Like I get it that she had 1M followers but she wasn't really like an influencer. How could she claim that she is the most influential person in Nepal. If she actually got 3 crore then maybe I should also be an influencer.|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart. She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||Why isn’t anyone asking her this - how much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes for the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||My mom generation dont even know the name shrinkhala|||So I assume your story is true. I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||>Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking  Sounds like a good thing if the justice was carried out right and the accused was found guilty beyond all reasonable doubts.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure.

I think there was a video where she said ki Nepal gov Wala scholarship ho vanera. Now it is not there(of course). Does somebody have that?|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||Why it is always about shrinkhala, I am never going to vote her for her being at Harvard! Propoganda,?|||I would have asked for proof instead of baseless allegations, but with the level of vocabulary you chose I guess excludes the question.|||She cannot stick to one story. She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money. |||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit. It's really easy to put dirty on people as it's anonymous|||TBH this all make no sense at all. can you post this on your public account IG or TikTok where people can see your face and account history?? The internet is dangerous and anyone can sit behind a screen make up stories and try to drag someone down just for attention. if you are really who you claim to be and if what you re saying about her is real then u need to show somethin that make sense. we need actual proof that you're a real person and that your story is true. and to be clear i 'am not asking for private or sensitive information i 'am asking for verifiable proof that doesn't expose personal data. post something that proves you are real AND U ACTUALLY KNEW HER not just a vouge words from behind an anonymous screen's.  you could show a public Harvard profile or alumni directory link with your name on it or simple photo of a Harvard ID or an official enrollment or graduation letter. without something like that, this is just baseless gossip. the internet is full of people who spread lies to ruin others, and that's exactly why nobody should take your words seriously without real evidence. if you truly care about the truth you'd stand behind your claims publicly. otherwise, what you're saying is just another reminder of how dangerous and misleading the internet can be when people use it to spread rumors without accountability.|||Give us some proof OP.

I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn’t a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that’s why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.

This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

He might be able to achieve more with a sensible government.  Sumana is smart and I feel like she has a level head on her. Head of state requires someone to be diplomatic as well as bold.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.   I might be wrong, but I believe, dissolution of the current parliament, an interim government led by candidates \"from the people, by the people, for the people\" - in it's truest sense, followed by a constitution reform for a directly elected state head is the answer.|||Prachanda has a history of working with RAW agency|||CIA?|||U janme Dekhi Nepal ma ashanti aako ho.|||even if he isn't he still needs to be brought to justice. kata lukeko xa yo chor.|||https://preview.redd.it/5spe7l1kqaof1.jpeg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0d5c200ef042d362e6344ad5b4e5d44dfd8e5e|||Probably|||https://preview.redd.it/qa507b014bof1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=594aa8a1c71a75c3eed28738e71393a88338e07f|||[deleted]|||Yes maathi inquiry garna mildaina without any influence aba.

The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again.

He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime.

As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. 🤡 I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.

I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the “Anti corruption “ protests.   Low IQ news media doesn’t count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I’m Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you 🙏|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests.

If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal.

All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him ....

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Its not true narrative this is all funded by cia|||Ye Media bik chuka hai|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there. If he just sits in his office chair waiting mindlessly while everybody is reaching him out to take a step then its alarming, is he really a possible prime minister candidate?? doubt huna thalchha, veda harlai feri yo bhanda pachdaina, he has some done good things too as a mayor but idk has he not abandon us when we needed him most? Aba desh ko yo awasta ma he is not a good leader anyways, pachhi aba j hunchha dekha jayega. Hope we rise again from the ashes.|||Balen is just a hype, he has never been a mayor of citizens; he is mayor of RONB; if there was no RONB, he would never have existed!|||Ony the strong system maketh the county! Balen is a populist and wanna be Oli.|||Am i the only one who thinks sagar dhakal is a much better than balen?

If he choose to be interim PM then people would have said he planned this all to come to power and be dictator.   Also he got death threats during that time.|||it depends on his role during these 2 days. back support thiyo bhane that is good.

His support ismuch needed in this time as he is the face of gen z, even though he wants it or not.|||Wait, you think Balen should have stepped up to be the PM? I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case. It still remains a fact that he could have interacted with us when he we needed him the most.|||such simple world if it did exist why would so many intellects be in the world of politics.

You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) 😔|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals 😂 what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could’ve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‘s important!

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore .

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us. Although I would say you have had a great loss of infrastructure which could have been avoided if the protest was properly managed.|||Abiskar Raut for POTUS  #RAUT2028|||Good speaker, I hope we learn a lot from him.|||Aja samma malai ni yo manchey(sudan gurung) ley miraj dhungana ley start gareko protest  lai hijack garera, sabai cerdit liyo vanney socheko thiye. Tara now when i am beginning to think,  Miraj dhungana was not brave enough to continue this revoltion so he gave up. Without  thinking about the lives lost, with what he have had started on tiktok. Sakidaina vaney kurai nanikaleko vaye hunthyo. Atleast daily life ta chali raheko thiyo sabai jana ko. Ahiley herda sabai damadol vaisakyo.   But since miraj dhungana didn't had courage to continue this revolution. He is not thankful enough, ki usley vaneko var ma yetro manchey sadak ma utriye ani kati ley jyan gumaye vanera. Ani when the gen z group, euta lost cause ma pugna lageko thiyo.  I feel sad to say, because i was against sudan gurung too. But i think, usley himmat nikalera yo cause lai continuity dina प्रयास garyo. Ho uslai ali bolney dhanga chaina. Tara ahiley yesto bela kaslai chahi dhanga huncha. When we all are frustrated??? And now when i think he may be acting up this way is because of all the backlash from the gen z and everyone while he is trying his best to keep the revolution alive. ra yestai bela aru patry ka jhikey haru ko pani sabai milera nana thari kura nikalera usailai gaali galoch garna thaley and even the zenz started to backlash him.

Why can't we try to support eachother instead of blaming each other??   And No body knows. Since those politicians where chased. They have little chance to establish again.  And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.   So stop blaming and fighting with each other. Please please please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  And sudin gurung, if you are reading this in anyway, now i hope you have  understood how harka sampang had felt when he was coming forward to save the country and you didn't supported him because of your personal vendetta.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window.

In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Also the harvard blog lol|||Most of her followers in isnt are fake and paid tho|||If you guys want social awareness of Nepal's issues, you should write fully in English.

She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||Why isn’t anyone asking her this - how much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns.

I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious.

I think there was a video where she said ki Nepal gov Wala scholarship ho vanera. Now it is not there(of course). Does somebody have that?|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||Why it is always about shrinkhala, I am never going to vote her for her being at Harvard! Propoganda,?|||I would have asked for proof instead of baseless allegations, but with the level of vocabulary you chose I guess excludes the question.|||She cannot stick to one story. She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money. |||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn’t a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that’s why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, “Dai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it’s been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn’t know what to say. That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

Sumana didi is a good person but certainly not the one whom we can chose to lead. I know very well of the core team and they have done a good job as a MP but she has to either quit her association with RSP if she has to become the genz representative or should be part of a guiding figure and more like a sallahakar kind of role to the genz representative. Because she has to come as Sumana as an individual , if she comes as a cadre of RSP, RSP le aaune election ma tesko rajnitik byaj khancha(RSP is going to take away a significant portion of credit, which is not at all fair. Because we didnt trust RSP in any way but we just supported a person)And everyone please be clear, RSP ko political roti sekna gareko haina yo revolution.  And Balen dai got serious dictatorial tendancies like someone here rightly mentioned. Leader got to be calm. Bhid lai unite garne leader chaiyeko cha hamlai uttejit banaune haina. Josh bharnu thik cha tara tesle naya polarization ma lagnu hunna statelai. We have already suffered alot from that.  But both of them are good leaders and massive respect to both of them for their relentless effort so far and we need their active contribution in rebuilding the new Nepal.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

Additionally, We don’t have practice of PM contesting for other smaller roles later in life. Maybe thats the reason he is not taking it.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4. He is RSP . Haven't issued anything about Ravi being released from prison by their goons.   5. She most probably planned this Gen z nonsense knowing well that it would cause this .|||Since no one knew who to send as a Gen Z representative, I chose to highlight a woman and a man who reflected the majority’s demands. BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

I get his appeal but I still think he should remain mayor for another term. He couldn't accomplish a lot of things because of the previous government. He might be able to achieve more with a sensible government.  Sumana is smart and I feel like she has a level head on her. Head of state requires someone to be diplomatic as well as bold.

Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this? To the same people who contributed in yesterday's mess and encouraged people to carry stones with them and to those same people who soft banned or removed posts when people showed concern over this idea when they realised how bad of an idea it is? Even the mods here are equally responsible for removing and deleting content where people like me were against this protest because we knew for a fact this was going to turn very violent and people are not going to protest peacefully because it did not look like they would especially here on reddit.

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger. You can only hope the rational one can eventually be the leader, and put the chaos and violence under control.|||You just need to re-steady the ship.

Congrats to all GenZ thinking this is some kind of revolution, you were controlled by deep state as usual.  Political instability causes far more problems than solutions.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal. All these people in power had to do was work towards uplifting of people rather exploit them, if they would have done 10% as well that would kept the citizens happy.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.   I might be wrong, but I believe, dissolution of the current parliament, an interim government led by candidates \"from the people, by the people, for the people\" - in it's truest sense, followed by a constitution reform for a directly elected state head is the answer.|||Prachanda has a history of working with RAW agency|||CIA?|||U janme Dekhi Nepal ma ashanti aako ho.|||even if he isn't he still needs to be brought to justice. kata lukeko xa yo chor.|||https://preview.redd.it/5spe7l1kqaof1.jpeg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0d5c200ef042d362e6344ad5b4e5d44dfd8e5e|||Probably|||https://preview.redd.it/qa507b014bof1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=594aa8a1c71a75c3eed28738e71393a88338e07f|||[deleted]|||Yes maathi inquiry garna mildaina without any influence aba.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

Millions of us depend on YouTube every day  for learning, for jobs, for communication with the world. Blocking it just because of some paperwork is such a backwards move.  If the government wants registration, fine — negotiate with Google, set up rules, whatever. But don’t cut off an entire nation from one of the most important platforms on the internet. This hurts students, creators, and businesses way more than it helps anyone.  Instead of solving the issue, they’ve basically told Nepali people: “too bad, no YouTube for you.” That’s not regulation that’s censorship.",

            "body": "Let me get straight to the point.  Nepal has a multy-party parliamentary system, which means it is a mixed election system. Which means when we vote, we vote for two things. One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
