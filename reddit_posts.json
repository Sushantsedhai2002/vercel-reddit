Brown eggs may cost more because brown-egg-laying hens are often larger and require more feed, but both types are equally healthy and nutritious as long as the chickens are raised under similar conditions.|||Different breed ko chicken vayera most probably  Like duck ko white hunchha|||Now! now!

It's just due to different breeds of layer chicken in India and Nepal.. white layer hen reared in India lay white eggs while the brown type layer hen reared in nepal lay brown eggs .. both are mostly similar in taste and nutritional values too I guess.

I’ve tried freelancing and physical labor, but nothing is available. I even thought about doing editing work, but I only have a 2011 PC, so that’s not possible either. I feel completely lost.  I consulted my mother about what I should do. She told me I just need to focus on studying, get good grades, and go to the gym, which she’s paying for. But I can’t stop thinking about our situation.

It's not your responsibility to carry the family when you are not even supposed to you are not even ready.|||I somewhat relate to you. Parents got divorced when I was in class 3 or 4. Dad transferred all the property except one which is called (rokka). Still took 25% of the land's value upfront to give up that land. We paid some loans off and bought another land near where we rent.  Got a big loan on our head now. My elder brother regrets studying expensive college like Islington where the money was gone for almost nothing. Didnt even get job related to the subject. Just took another huge loan to send him abroad. Still not able to send money back. Many other loans still on us.  I kind of saw this coming so I went for the cheaper college for bachelors. Started working from 1st semester. Almost 3 years later, I have a good income where I can atleast sustain my mom and myself while paying rent. But ya the loan is still there and we can barely manage to pay the interest.  Forgive that background. My point is you need to study no matter what. College jau. I suggest 12 samma majale padha. Good results can land you scholarship for bachelors. Bachelors suru hunu bhanda aagadi dekhi get a decent job jun you can do. Doesnt matter what, just get money for your family.

I was almost sure you messed up the homepage css but it seems you messed up on Elementor. - I'm guessing you're still young, hence I'm not nitpicking issues. I'm sure you've made some progress but I suggest not using AI for your projects.  - Stick to one tool. Kotlin or Flutter. Being a beginner in both doesn't help. UI screens, small apps, widgets, layouts are something you can make in a week. You need to learn state management, version control, documentation, and lots of things before you are job-ready. - You seem to be getting engagement from youtube shorts. Stick with it, work on the site.   I noticed you're using an AI assistant in one of your apps. Did you train a RAG for your usecase, and does it have a backend?|||[deleted]",

Usko chai aahiley renovation chali rako cha ghar ma so me being the nice bf that I am, told her she could come over to my house and ask the teacher to come there to teach. I would be all day in my classes as well so disturb ni hunthena(she has morning classes I have day classes)  So for few hours a day, she was getting tuition from the teacher in my room. Or so I thought. Ekdin chai mero classes haru chito sakkiyo and I went home about an hour early.

My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug.

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

Look, I am not comfortable with my wife wearing very revealing clothes. We talked about it and we reached a compromise- now I don’t bring it up and she doesn’t push it either. You both need to be comfortable with what is acceptable; but know that it’s still her body and she gets to make the decision.

Why would you even send her the reel in the first place knowing that you sometimes feel uncomfortable about it? Also, your “response” may have seemed good but you picked the wrong time my guy. Clearly from her replies, she wasn’t in a mood for such a response, and now she’s left you wondering if your relationship is even going to last.

If she loves you I think she should be little considerate on wearing those clothes since it's making you uncomfortable. But it all comes down to proper communication and respect at the end of the day. She choosing not to wear that clothes shows the respect she had towards you and your relationship. May she would understand what you want.|||If she's a daddy issue, don't date her, bro.|||Just leave bro, hit gym focus on yourself!|||She is your gf, not wife. Have fun.

Ani before you say i just wanna protect her or some shit its not about the clothing its about the mindset of the observer.|||Is this a deal breaker though? You gotta look at a person as a whole, not just this one side of her. Maybe she's going through a rebellious phase where she wants to experiment and be free in how she expresses herself (having a strict controlling father could do that to some personalities). Maybe this is her personality and her core value - someone who really believes we should be allowed to wear whatever pleases us. And anyone who tries to stop her in her eyes is considered insecure or controlling and she could be right in some instances (think about the burqa for example), but there could be other reasons too. But it sounds like she may not be ready to listen to these other possible reasons yet.   Her reply to you definitely seems a bit defensive, possibly coming from a hurt somewhere. In that case, try to really understand from her point of view - tell her you want to understand her stance on this better and actually just listen and ask good questions that seek to understand.   Ultimately, you gotta look at a person as a whole. In the best relationships, you don't seek to control...you try to understand each other's point of view and sometimes agree to disagree. You try to see the best in each other, uplift each other and push each other to be the best versions of themselves.   Unless there are many other red flags you see in her, or your values in life do not align at all, or this particular issue is a deal breaker for you, then you know what to do. But if it's not a deal breaker, then have that honest chat with her, telling her that she is free to wear what she desires.|||She is for the streets.

Dai got married to a girl(arranged marriage). Just two days after the wedding, the girl’s bf came to Dai’s house drunk. He cried in front of the house, created a scene and begged to return his gf. After half an hour of his tantrum, the girl also broke into tears and begged Dai to let her go with him. She too started showing tantrum. Being a gentleman, Dai let her go with him in the presence of the ward chairperson and police.  That Dai married her with her consent, and they had even talked for a few months before the marriage.

Judging a book by its cover is almost always folly.  No one is born equal and some people will get every material thing in life handed to them. While this equates to a more comfortable life with more pleasure, happiness and the feeling of security is a different game altogether.  A villager living let's say in Dolpa will generally have lower stress levels than a wall street millionaire, will generally be more secure in themselves and live a less agitated life.

Everyone always feels like they’re lacking something. What we have and take for granted might be a luxury for someone else. That’s how I see it.  Obviously I’ve seen people whose lives seem perfectly aligned and sorted, but that’s just an external point of view. Even they might be lacking something and feeling dissatisfied. So I just try to be happy with what I have, which is actually hard, but I try to stay optimistic.  And honestly, the biggest and most important thing is health. If you’re healthy and don’t have any major disease or problem, that already makes you extremely lucky compared to so many people out there.|||same. malai ni yestai hunxa whenever I see girls prettier than me, espeically mero relative mah, everyone look so gorgeous.

His relatives have shown him many girls, but they said he never agrees  . he has so much higher expectations 😏  His mama introduced me to him. He was in Australia, and we started chatting. He hesitated about my age in the beginning, which I came to know only later . otherwise, I might not have talked to him. But his mama knew me well and told him, “She is a nice girl, I know her well,” both your age match and so on.  Then he talked to me, and we had proper conversations. After few conversation , chat ,video call and after sharing everythings . He said he liked me,  he found me perfect, and  I was the type of girl he wanted to marry.  He even told his mama that when he talks to other girls, he doesn’t feel connected . some seem like they only want to marry to go abroad or for financial reasons. He has said, She is straightforward and genuine. I like her. I think I will marry her. So we kept talking and everything was going smoothly. As he was showing positive sign that he likes me. His mama was also encouraging me to talk more.  He came to Nepal this kartik. We met indirectly first he had come to attend his cousins wedding in pokhara at a party venue near my house. He is from Kathmandu but has his mamaghar in Pokhara and had stayed there during childhood. We meet at my house . he was the one interested to meet and talk , know my family as his cousion marriage venue is near .  My mom was only there at that time .I offered him tea. He talked nicely to my mom and was very nice to me. After meeting, he told me it was nice to see me, that I look good, much younger than my age and even praised me. He seems excited.   He said, After my cousin’s wedding party, I’ll meet you personally and we’ll talk about our future planss but all of sudden he told me ,  i have to go to kathmandu urgently and will come and meet in few days .   After that, he stopped contacting me. I didn’t contact him either. He became completely unreachable.   My family asked his mama, and even his mama was irritated with his behavior, because he never accepts any girl no matter how good she is and how many girl he show .   His mama asked his mother, and his mother said, “The girl is nice, but  nadi dosh dekhiyo china herauda . His mama had already checked our china, and it was perfect that’s why we had started talking. But his mother didn’t respond properly and just said, “China ma dosh dekhiyo, kasari garne?”  His mama tries to convince him , but he gives an excuse of nadi dosh . yestarday his mama said me  that his fupu recently showed him a girl who is around 23, and now his mother is interested in her.    ps:  yes my age is much  but i also geniunely like him marry and settle.i am just suprised the kind of men he is and there is few marriage proposal for me too but i am disinterested for now .  i am surprised why his mind changed ??",

What on earth could he possibly have common with someone who is 23?|||Forget about him this shows age doesn't bring maturity. at 42 he has already lived half his life still he don't know how to handle things properly. He could have communicated with you and end things properly instead of running and hiding behind his mother's pallu. Such people are really not a good choice as a life partner if you have any other option|||wait whatttyty he got a girl who is 23... wtf dude🤢🤢🤢🤢 23 Y/O girl and 42 yo suddo😵😵 hami tesai single va ta haina raxa ni 🥱|||He wants to have sex with young girl, whom he can control,  is gullible.

But even after all this, talking to you, visiting your home, meeting you and everything, he still decided not to? Then yeah, he wasn’t serious at all.  I don’t get it. He’s a dude in his 40s, so why is he still acting like a child? If he wasn’t even interested, why approach in the first place? He could’ve just said, “Let’s not move forward,” right at the beginning instead of giving someone hope.  Also, it sounds creepy. He’s in his 40s, why is he looking for someone in their early 20s? Yeah, you definitely dodged a bullet.|||He just sounds like a gay guy who doesn’t want to get married and is lying to his family about nadi dosh and china|||Atti yaar. Wanting a 20+ years age gap in an arranged marriage setting is wild. Even if he married you, there were high chances he would've cheated. Girl, find someone similar to your age. This type of men genuinely disgust me.|||It’s so funny that since ages women have been getting slut shamed for wanting a financially stable men but men have been running after young girls and getting away with it bcs our society loves to bring down only women. But it’s nice to know that these things have been coming to light these days cause i’m seeing lots of similar posts|||He's a creep for wanting a girl on her 20s when he's already a 40+  Eww disgusting 🤢  He has a pedophilic disorder.|||you deserve better|||Everything happens for good.

You may be exaggerating a bit.   No parents would marry their daughter who is double their age in arranged marriage unless they are very poor or they truly want to get something from the man's family.   The boy is 42 wanting to marry 23 does not sound right.The 10 years age gap is tolerable in nepalese society. Beyond 10 years shows that the girl (if she accepts), wants something from that man and the girl's parents want something. In that case, it is a transactional marriage.   I have seen a 65 year old marrying a 35 year old woman. But the woman was divorced and had a daughter.   I suspect that the boy might be 33-35 and rejected you and started looking for a younger girl. You got hurt and exaggerated.|||Its honestly disgusting how these older men always prefer young women with a generational gap. A mutual friend of mine who is in her early 20s married a guy in his mid 40s ( that is literally my mother's age), and that guy is my chimeki. He is divorced and has a 12-13 yr old son. The girl recently got pregnant. My god, i feel so bad for her. She is in her 2nd year of bachelor's and has to care for her baby. Tbh, the mother's of these men are also responsible for encouraging this pedophilia. These are the people who think of women as a baby machine and a slave. Just weak ass men who can't handle the girl their age.|||it is basic nash equilibrium. everybody trying to have optimal for themself. he got better so he deviated else if would have no incentive to deviate|||First of all you are 33. Which is wayyy younger than this guy who is already almost a decade older than you.  My suggestion, don’t let this random ass man get so much leverage on your brain. Move on, look for someone who’s genuine and respectful!  Nepali arrange marriage culture is horrendous!|||yup nothing wrong wanting younger beautiful women. it is same as women wanting caring loyal and rich husband|||why is your read so much like \"He wanted this, he said this,..he did this\" and not like \"I also liked him?\" and if you didnt like him then why is it an issue right now for you??|||He might be gay and can't tell his parents|||Expired.",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either.

Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason.

They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents. I work with Pakistanis tho and it’s the same case for them too.|||I can speak almost Indian passing Hindi (PUBG lobbies lol) but I never speak Hindi with Indians in the US.|||Yes, please stop to speak Hindi.|||I just tell them that i am from northern nepal so I don’t understand hindi, i have been working there for 1.5 yrs they have no cluee about itt|||That's why i only Speak either Nepali or English. I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

            "body": "So why don’t Nepalese freak out about it? Why is no one protesting?  Honestly? Because:  1. Most Nepalese just vibe. The average Nepali is busy surviving, working, studying, or trying to get that visa. No one has the energy to fight strangers every time they say “Same thing hai na?”   2. We’re used to being ignored. Globally, Nepal = Everest + Gautam Buddha + trekking. That’s it. Our language barely enters the conversation.   3. Nepali people learn Hindi without even trying. Bollywood, TV serials, Indian YouTube, cross-border trade, songs, memes  Hindi is everywhere. Even if you never sat in a classroom for it, you’ll magically understand 80% of Hindi just by growing up Nepali.   4. Hindi influenced us… but we also influenced Hindi. Half the words are cross-shared across Sanskrit roots. It’s natural for South Asian languages to overlap. But overlap ≠ identical.   5. We’re too chill about our identity. We love our nationality, but we rarely assert it the way other countries do. We quietly adapt instead of loudly correcting people.  Meanwhile Indians think… “Nepali? Isn’t that just Hindi?”  Not all, but many Indians:  Have never heard Nepali spoken properly  Don’t know it’s the official national language of an entire country  Think it’s a dialect because it’s written in Devanagari  Assume everyone around the subcontinent speaks Hindi because Bollywood is huge   And because Nepalis speak Hindi fluently, Indians assume we learned their language, not realizing we absorbed it out of necessity, media exposure, and proximity.  Why this triggers our nationality (my pov):  Because to us:  Nepali isn't “small.” It’s our identity.  It's the language of our moms yelling at us, our jokes, our culture, our songs, our poems.  When someone reduces it to “Hindi but different,” it feels like our whole culture gets downgraded.   We’re not against Hindi. We’re not against Indians. We’re just tired of Nepali being treated like background noise.   Lastly  Nepali is not Hindi.  Nepalese know Hindi because of exposure, not because it’s taught.  Indians often don’t recognize Nepali as a separate language.  Nepalese rarely complain, but deep down, it does poke our sense of nationality.  It’s a hate in my pov.  Drop your statement if you have kinda same feeling.",

We should have to serious about this right now....|||As someone who grew up abroad but born Nepali, I’ve been so proud to know that many other Nepali who have come abroad have brought the culture of hospitality and respect and committed it to their new environment. I’ve never heard of anyone in Australia bad mouthing Nepali people, in fact they remember that 1 staff member from a couple of jobs ago, and how kind, considerate and hard working they were.   I can’t say my disdain for Indian people/culture/behaviour has been known from visiting India or interacting with Indian tourists in Nepal but rather, the Indians in Australia who have created a negative sentiment to the Australian people because they are not willing to assimilate.   I guess it is the same notion that Indians see themselves and their culture/language as superior, regardless of the perception of Nepali people or the way they are perceived in Australian society. The Indians in Australia don’t integrate themselves well into society because they don’t really get what it means to be Australian, as opposed to just obtaining PR/citizenship. (Maybe someone can comment from a Canadian perspective)  Nepali people have that general enthusiasm to share and have intercultural exchange because of the diversity in language, ethnicity, drinks and food we have and the cultural traditions/events that occur almost every day of the week.. heck, the Indians who visit Nepal, come for these very reasons!   I’m just incredibly proud that real human interactions with my dajus/didis in Australia has made it easy to be forward with my heritage and culture because many Aussies have had nothing but those glowing things to say. Nepali people abroad have truly represented Nepal well despite the 3rd world experience in the country where most locals will do anything to make an extra buck and have given tourists some negative experiences.   Overall, absolutely love being a part of this Nepali generation, I don’t think I’ve ever met a Nepali person and not befriended them. Jai Nepal!🇳🇵|||I find it kinda funny whenever someone paints the Nepali language as something that every Nepali should have affinity for. Though I understand the power dynamic behind Nepalis being spoken to Hindi in Nepal by the Indians, which in my opinion kinda problematic in that context, I don't actually see any problem in people speaking in whatever language they feel comfortable with. Personally, I reply in English or use broken Hindi without putting much effort in those situations.         I am a newari guy. I don't actually care much about Nepali language aside from using it as a communication tool with fellow Nepalis. Yes, it's one of the languages spoken in Nepal, hence there's a general obligation to say that we should preserve the national langauges just like any other non-newari person will say about Newari language.      And, strictly speaking about my personal attachment or pride associated with Nepali language, it's practically zero.    So, please stop enforcing the narrative that (all) Nepalis have similar feeling towards Nepali language as the ones whose mother tongue is Nepali language.|||RELAX lmao|||It's just indian mentality i think. They got colonized but in the process they themselves have developed the same mindset. So I think it'll take some time before they realize thier own persona.  Tbh i don't give a shit about this. If somebody behaves to me like that whether they are indian or not, i speak up about it and just go about my day.   At the same time, I think we both indians and nepalese are kind of same ( like in a human character way ).|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali. Then when I reply in Nepali, they ask, “Why are you speaking that?” And I’m like, how the f* do you think I understood whatever bullshit you were mumbling? That’s all. But South Indians are actually good…they don’t do this",

If you're going on a trek, I'd strongly advise getting a guide for any number of reasons.  A solo female traveler from Germany died just last week, apparently because she followed a route that was on a map but had been abandoned in favor of a less dangerous route.  A guide would have taken her on the correct path.|||I think Nepal is generally considered safe for travelers, including solo female travelers. However, you have to follow common sense precautions as you would elsewhere.  The normal places that travelers go to, like the popular trekking routes, will be safe besides maybe some petty tourist scams. Off the beaten path, I'd be cautious of scammers more than of safety.   It's a very different situation when compared with India.|||It's relatively safe for travellers. But do use caution regardless, even if majority are harmless, the small minority could end up harmful.|||Super safe.

It doesn't apply to tier 1-2 cities in nepal as people have majorly accepted modernism. Beside scammers I barely feel any threat for female travellers. Nepal is much safer country comparatively and more safer compared to South Asian countries.|||Yep quite safe actually, you might be scam at some places. Remeber you don’t need to hire guides for a lot of places. Also foreigners usually get charged more so only go to a pkace after checking the review. Also use ride sharing app: indrive, pathao etc etc which will cost you lot less than just hiring taxi from the road. Please avoid public transportation if possible. And no streed food. Incase of diarrhea eats lots of water mix with ORS and not antibiotics or anti diarrhea stuff. Seek medical help if you feel sick.|||Avoid bordering towns with india.    Rest of Nepal is safe.

That said, it’s always wise to stay cautious especially in tourist areas near temples since a few people may try to sell cheap items at inflated prices.  Occasionally, someone might offer help in a friendly way but later expect money, though this is rare. Younger Nepalese, in particular, are usually genuinely friendly and happy to help without expecting anything in return, so don’t hesitate to approach them. Some older or poorer individuals might expect a small tip, but that’s not the norm. Most Nepalese are incredibly warm and welcoming win their heart, and they might even offer you food.

I had applied for some position at United Distributors Nepal (UDN). During the first round of the interview, the HR straight-up told me:  * “You must come in formal dress for the next round of the interview if you are selected,” * “Long hair is strictly against our policy,” * “If you get hired you *must* cut your hair,” * and also, “For the second round you *have* to come with your hair cut & in formal dress”  I had been growing my hair for almost **2 years**. It was something I was attached to; part of my identity honestly but I really wanted that job and the way HR said it made it sound like it was basically mandatory, so…  Yeah.   I cut it.   The whole thing.  And here's the kicker; once I actually went to the second interview, I was so nervous and scared (because I recently resigned from my job without any backup plan) that I messed up the interview.  And of course…   I didn’t get the job.  No feedback, no apology, nothing & now I'm having a feeling like I sacrificed something important for absolutely nothing.  I know it sounds silly to some people “it’s just hair.” But nah, when you’ve kept something for years and you give it up because someone in HR says you must… and then you still don’t get the job? It stings.  And today — months later — did my brain suddenly go:  >“Hey, remember when you cut your long-ass hair for that company and they didn’t even hire you?”  And now I’m reliving the whole thing and feeling stupid for doing it.

Being told outright to cut it feels more like a way to assert dominance than a reasonable request...

Everything is so overwhelming. Workers help you expecting money from you like c’mon i didn’t ask for you to put my suitcase in the trolly. Not to mention nepali citizens who have no civic sense. Taking anyone luggage off the carousel thinking its theirs and leaving them outside carousel making it hard for people to find their luggage.  Don’t even get me started that at that stupid escalator.

I was just there a few days ago. My observations:  - There’s no decorum or order - absolute chaos. - Don’t know how to sugarcoat this, but it smells like feet everywhere. Need air flow and ventilation. - Limited cafe/restaurants in the int’l terminal - don’t know why they wouldn’t open up nicer places. People are willing to spend $ - Grateful they have chargers, but it’s placed in the middle of the walkways. How about next to the seats? - Only one water station after security - I’d add another one - Bathrooms are disgusting and totally unusable  After being back in KTM after 7 years, the city itself has grown so much. The airport? Not so much.|||When I had arrived in Nepal via TIA well,even I was shocked everyone were pretty helpful.

They are the reason airport is messed up. Here is why:  1. They have no incentive to perform or change and fix what is not working. If they change anything or make things more lenient or easier they actually risk being ostracized. 2. Rules and processes are added for a really tight system and  for reducing false negatives. So need 2-3 means of verification for smallest of the procedure.  3. There is some unwarranted fear if the rules are not strict Indians and Americans will eat the country alive :p. Therefore they feel it is justified to make everything manual and cumbersome. 4. They are paid low and use any slight deviation to seek bribe.  5. They are too many of them. If things are automated we wouldn't need most of them. Why do you need to put passengers through 5 different lines and 5-10 staffs in each line. 6. Least travelled and least visionary people end up joining the service and are given a lot of power. Power trip makes them even worse. 7. They can't be fired.

It is **sacrosanct** and must not be touched for the Classic 350.  # Step 2: The Core Investment (50% - approx. ₹2,50,000)  * **Action:** Systematically invest **₹2,50,000**.    * *Suggestion 1:* Start a few **SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans)** in well-performing Equity Mutual Funds (50-60% of this amount).    * *Suggestion 2:* Invest the rest in blue-chip Nepali stocks (NEPSE) or a solid bank FD if you are extremely risk-averse. * **Purpose:** This money is for your future financial freedom. Your money is now working harder than you are.  # Step 3: The Classic 350 Fund (30% - approx. ₹1,50,000)  * **Action:** Place this **₹1,50,000** into a separate, easily accessible fund. * **The Compromise:** The Classic 350 typically costs upwards of ₹5 Lakhs, which means your ₹1.5 Lakhs is the perfect **Down Payment**. * **The Adulting Test:** Take a **manageable loan** for the remaining amount (₹3.5 Lakhs). Since you are already earning, you can pay this off over 2-3 years.  # 👑 Conclusion:  By executing the **Hybrid Compromise**, you achieve all your goals:  1. **You get the Classic 350** (satisfying your heart) without wiping out your entire savings. 2. **You begin your investment journey** and start building real wealth (satisfying your brain). 3. **You have an emergency fund** (₹1,00,000) for security.  The smartest move is to **Invest 50% / Down Payment 30% / Save 20%**.|||Petrol haldai ruinxa|||Deepseek:   💡 **Bottom line:**  Your 5 lakhs is a safety net + seed capital for future you.

Don’t jump into business without a plan.  **Maybe the smart move is:**   \\*Invest 70%, keep 20% liquid, use 10% to treat yourself (maybe a second-hand bike or a trip to clear your head).\\*  And remember—financial literacy isn’t about denying yourself joy; it’s about affording your dreams without panicking later.

            "body": "everyone's watching gagan thapa's interview but watch this [https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ](https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ) video of him speaking in parliament just weeks before bhadra 23 happened. only if the government had listened to him.   Gagan thapa from what I see was always fighting within the party and was always corned because he didn't have grab on the party like deuba did. in party system, you've got to be a party leader before you can have a chance to get executive role and walk the talk. but finally he has the chance to lead the party. i really hope he does.  Gagan thapa who once used to be beacon of hope doesn't have that flair anymore. Nepali society has that tendency to make someone hero every once in a while. 2063 was Prachande, 2072 was Oli, 2080 was Rabi. Gagan Thapa was somewhere there all along as youth face until Nepali society got another hero in face of Rabi. People these days criticize Gagan Thapa for failing to deliver and not meeting the expectations. I remember people wanting Gagan Thapa to be Prime Minister back then but there's no hope from him anymore.  I personally think Gagan Thapa wasn't ready to be PM back then. Yes, his speeches sounded good, yes he had that craze , yes he was a young face in politics but he didn't have experience. Politics isn't as easy as populists think. It needs understanding of how government actually functions. If you've followed gagan thapa for past 6-7 years, he's finally being a mature political face.   after 2074, though congress lost the elections badly against NCP (oli+prachande) , Gagan thapa was constantly saying that party was going to break down on their own.  Later when Congress decided to form coalition with maobadi for 2079 elections, Gagan Thapa constatly stood against that decision and look how that turned out to be. Though Congress became first party, not a single chance to be PM.   Gagan Thapa stood against giving vote of confidence to Prachande when Oli and prachande formed government after elections. Later Prachande betrayed congress and went back to Oli.  Gagan thapa focused that congress should then be a strong opposition until next elections and shouldn't play to form government but deuba didn't listen and supported oli to form government. How that worked out for him - exit from politics by getting pun\\*ched by bunch of gen Zs and public humiliation.  When congress was in government, Gagan Thapa worked relentlessly for a couple of months on few ordinances - the one to let nepali companies invest abroad was significant one and welcomed. but soon the government started losing track and gagan thapa started criticizing the government his party was part of. just a couple of weeks before bhadra 23 happened, gagan thapa was there criticizing government by speaking in parliament. only if government had listened to him lol.  only if deuba had listened to gagan when he was suggesting deuba to take support out from government when oli decided the social media ban, thing would've turned differently.  gagan gets a lot of hate from RSP supporters for being critical about rabi's sahakari case - well, if there was no substantial proof, all 3 tiers of courts wouldn't have put him in custody. I'll say let court decide the case (and thats going to take lots of years , thats how court works in nepal).",

The story: A while ago, I was going through one of the lowest phases of my life. My mind was overflowing, and to cope, I created a small Instagram page where I posted random thoughts and videos. Those little expressions slowly grew into something much bigger — a website, and now an app that I’ve poured my entire soul into. It might not relate to everyone, but it’s something born straight from emotion, honesty, and healing.  The website is already live, and I’m preparing to launch the app on the Play Store. But before approval, Google requires internal testing, where real users try the app for a few days. They may check your activity numbers or even ask a few basic questions about your experience — that’s all. So I’m looking for a small group of genuine testers.  About the app: It’s an anonymous letting-go platform — a safe emotional space where you can write whatever you’re feeling, post little journal entries, and express thoughts without identity or pressure. It also lets you download beautiful universe-style images created from those messages, so every emotion becomes something artistic.  I genuinely couldn’t think of a better community than this one to support this phase. If anyone wants to be a tester for 14 days, I’d be incredibly grateful. And as a tiny thank-you — I’ll buy a plate of momo for every registered tester. ❤️  Please let me know if you’d like to join. Your support would truly mean a lot.

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction.",

Any country can say nepal is not very good cuz lets just be honest and accept that its true but not bangladesh, india and other third world countries puhlease 🙄. They should be worrying about themselves.|||My opinion is that people should use whatever language they know that works to their advantage.  In your case, it was beneficial to speak in English to avoid having your coworkers discriminate against you.  On some occasion, the ability to speak Hindi can be beneficial.  It depends on circumstance.|||same lol, arko nation ko manchhe sanga bolda kheri universal language ma bolnu parchha bhanne pani tha hudaina yiniharu lai. sidhai hindi ma bolna aauchan. jhyamma diu jasto. uniharu kai language ma bolnu parne jhai|||I have lots of Indian friends too. We are ignorant about a lot of other countries and cultures too. You should educate them. In Nepal, madeshis are treated as Indians and Sherpas, Gurungs/ etc are treated as Tibetans.

Don’t go looking for jobs at some racist Indian.|||I always try to speak in English as i’m in foreign nation where mostly english is spoken. I try to speak Nepali only in private setup or close friends. Hindi is a big no for me, they don’t respect your boundaries after you speak in Hindi.

If someone asks me if I speak Hindi, I say yes because I grew up in Nepal and a lot of Nepalis can understand Hindi. That honestly makes me sound better.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.   This makes us look inferior infront of them.|||agreed|||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali. Then when I reply in Nepali, they ask, “Why are you speaking that?” And I’m like, how the f* do you think I understood whatever bullshit you were mumbling? That’s all. But South Indians are actually good…. they don’t do this.|||mero case ma tah jun language bole nii, malai tyahi desh ko maanxe hepna thaalxa, fyi - i speak nepali,hindi, bengali(bangladesh), japanese, basic german too. cuz i speak all these like native, fluent.|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much.

You need to speak a few languages to be able to travel. Or travel in a series/ it’s a travel agent term where they have interpreters/ cultural consultants etc.|||I don't think its a language issue but that particular problem treating you like shit issue. You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||Rent free|||\"Indian movies and serial were basically forced hindi onto us\"   How so?

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||learn sanskrit the civilizational language of all the hindus, buddhists and even kirants.

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi.

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing?

Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

I had to go to Gwarko (which was a new location for me), so I decided to use Indrive. The fare was way too high, so I dropped it down to a rate that I thought was okayiish. Smhow, I found a guy who accepted the proposed fare. He was an 18 yr old student living with his brother, doing +2/Indrive side by side with his Honda Shine. He’d only been doing it for 2 weeks because his brother had fractured his leg while riding for Indrive. Bro was so unfamiliar with the roads (as in, he didn’t know how to use G-Map and reach specific locations), and the old Honda Shine kept stalling itself in the middle of the road. After 30 minutes of riding, he said, Paisa pardaina, ma arko Indrive khojdinchu hajur ko lagi, but I insisted, Dhilo bhaye ni chalcha. He kept taking longer routes for shorter ones (I actually had fun, tho). After 1:30 hours, with traffic jams and his longer routes fetish, we somehow made it to the destination. I was the victim here, but I felt bad for the guy since he was new to the job, trying to be a responsible brother, and helping his brother out in need. Sometimes, it’s important to read the environment. You don’t really know what someone else is going through. I gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times lol.  Tldr:- Took an Indrive to Gwarko with a new rider, an 18 yr old student. The ride was chaotic, he didn’t know the roads, his bike kept stalling, and he took longer routes. After 1:30 hours, we finally reached the destination. I was the victim here, but felt bad for him since he was just trying to help his brother(injured). Gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times.",

Nothing will change even if we do. The same thing will happen to whatever new capital gets announced. Instead, we should focus on decentralization.

Most colleges are in Kathmandu, hospitals are the same, job opportunities are the same, and even the main international airport is here, despite billions being spent on two other airports that turned out to be useless.  So yes, we should work on decentralization. Make other cities better too.

I didnt think much of it.   Later at Thapathali bus stand i was stuck in traffic jam and I saw an aunty in thapathali bustand almost in tears arguing with a bus conductor. Apparently he had put her bags of clothes (worth around 30k) on the roof of the bus but by the time they reached Thapathali, only one bag was left.  I told her that I had seen several bags at Tripureshwor. Without even thinking she hopped onto the back of my bike. I was already getting late for class but couldnt say no.   I reached college 25 minutes late, got scolded, and wasnt even allowed to attend my first lecture.   All of this could have been avoided if the bus driver and conductor had done their job responsibly. After all this the 'khale' was like we dont know go search it yourself to that aunty.",

            "body": "TLDR; girl i have been speaking to for over a year is going around in reddit cheating on me behind my back.     I went to meet her a couple of days back, she and I have been speaking for a year now, we were thinking of being official soon as well. It was me, her and 2 more friends, it was a double date situation. she and another girl went to washroom and they were taking a while. i saw some notification popping up in her phone. i dont really use anyone's phone so i was not trying to check but the other friend started saying how he wants to check that notification since he does the same of his girl. i thought if it was from my parents maybe i should inform her so let me just glance at it. turns out it was a text of her from a guy in reddit. i scrolled slighty and found that they had been talking for like 4 days.  my heart sank when i saw that she was calling him daddy, baby and whatever. (mind you, she doesnt still know his name at this point,), she was making very sexual comments and this time, all of this was happening without the boy bringing it up. I scrolled a bit down, it was conversation from Sunday. That day when we were on call, she said she was not feeling well and wanted to sleep soon around 10, turns out she texted him at 10:10 saying \"i am super horny right now, send me your shirtless pic\", the boy does it, she follows up with \"send me your d\\*ck pic and i will send you my nudes.\" again the boy has done it. she follows up with \"i like how you look, lets meet up.\"  i was devastated. That time when i checked her phone, turns out the boy was texting her to meet this friday. she came back from washroom and i just informed her that she got a text, for the first time, she opened her phone while hiding it from me. she chose to angle the phone in such a way that i cant view it at all.  i asked if everything is ok, she asked did you see kasko text thiyo, i just said \"not really, I didnt check, is everything fine?\" she replies \"ahh sathi ko thiyo\"  and the more devastating thing here is the fact that there are multiple other DMs there, so dont think its her first time. But i see you now woman. i see what you want to do. During initial month of us talking, you went to every chats and DM i had to make sure i was not someone who would DM anyone or just hoeing around. Turns out, you are the one who is hoeing right now. I remember her talking about how her friend cheating was justified because everyone should have options, you tried to cover it saying that you werenot like that. but look at you now.   I know you are going to read this post since you are always active here. And so i say this to you, you are I are done. F\\*ck this shet. If you were open to me about not wanting me and looking to find new people, I would have been fine with it but going behind my back, its unacceptable.  Yours truly.",

After half an hour of his tantrum, the girl also broke into tears and begged Dai to let her go with him. She too started showing tantrum.

I make $7500/m which equates to 10 lakh+ per month.   Land prices seem to have peaked.   Fixed Deposit gives peanut returns.   Gold is at all time high, so better not to put on gold right now.   Stock market is too weak and fragile of Nepal.   Buying and renting a house doesnt give much return.   3 crore house gives 2 lakh per month income in US, in Nepal 50k or less.   People know I make good money, they dont know how much exactly, so people solicit me to invest in their hotels, goat farms, poultry farm, which i dont trust them unless im actively involved.   I dont invest in US markets, 401k, S&P, indexes, I have it all but I want to invest in Nepal as I plan to live in Nepal forever.   I'm here in Kathmandu, with just cash in bank not knowing what would be the best use of it or where to invest properly so the wealth grows overtime.   I am not necessarily seeking risk free investments, I know every investment carries risk.   But I want to put you in my shoes to crowdsource opinion.   1. Where would you invest 1 crore a year disposable income?   2. If you're already a high income earner, where are you investing your money?   3. What areas or industries you think will do in the next 20 years.   Also, if you think im lying, just move on with other posts and keep the thread to people who are here to drop genuine opinions.",

Keep some amount liquid 9. If earning in dollars, Keep the amount in dollars (dollar account) and withdraw only what is needed.  Basically diversify investments and save myself my time when possible.

But, now I am here, it makes sense🤣🤣.|||Every time I read post like this, I get very curious. And you keep adding more information in your comments, which don’t add up at all.   Only way you can do US job while in Nepal is if you are USC or GC holder (up to 6 months remote). Either way, job market in US is going downhill, why company will pay you extra if they can get same skill or better, lot cheaper by outsourcing your job. If their policy already allows doing their financial tasks from Nepal. I am sure there are tons of people dying to get those jobs in 1/4th of your pay.  Second, If you are USC, then forget about investing in Nepal, it will be really hard (from Nepal Gov side). And also, you will still pay all taxes in US, including federal, state (with some conditions and California is aggressive about that), social security and Medicare, which comes close to 25-30% depending on state.   Third, you keep saying you went to top 20 University here, which means you have spent fortune there unless you got majority as grants. Which means, either you are very smart or rich. In both case you are deeply vested here in US and there is no way you can forget all that and go back to Nepal. If you have enough wealth to pay top 20 Universities then why bother working late night, if you have received grants then you already saw greater opportunities in US.  Fourth, you said, you don’t invest in 401k, and you said your major is finance. A person with finance degree doesn’t want to invest free money they get from company? Most companies do 3 to 6% match, why you’ll leave money on the table? Especially you can choose if you want to invest it in volatile or stable options.  There are tons of red flags, which I can keep adding and make my comment longer but in short your own comments disagree with what you are saying.  Why I am writing this long comment? Coz you are disturbing fake dream to Nepali youths, trying to prove that life is so easy once you go abroad. Which is not. Where is your story about your struggle? How did you come to US? What did you do before you get financial job? How did you pay for your college? Is there any struggle your parents did to send you to one of the top 20 University?|||I think you should invest in potential startup if you have certain knowledge about how this system works?|||What do you do that makes you this much money?|||Ma chai long term ko lagi ramro dividend bonus history vako large cap ma monthly invest gardai xu  Nepse ma. certain amount yesai bank ma xa for emergency and rainy days and loan to people chai good source of income vako xa 20% jasto interest dinxan manxe haru.

When you do move to Nepal, you will have endless money to do what you want and more importantly, capital to actually invest in a business that you can actively oversee and thus best the market   If you don’t want to have good liquidity, invest in real estate with project potential.

They will keep on getting profit from you and you will alway go on loss.   Real estate in Nepal is not even an option forget it  Another great idea is investing small business.

I told one of my friend to buy that trump meme coin, and dump it all the next day, he earned some good cash that time lol. That's just how it it, I would say the dip in crypto is pretty heart breaking though, but I would still do it if I had access like you. * **Franchising / Business Investments**: Invest in established franchises for a reliable income stream or use your capital to start a business in high-demand sectors like food or retail.  One question:   I too work in a US based company, it's good, but not as good as 10 Lakh per month, if you don't mind could you share what sector you work?? Or, let's chat in DM for that matter if you have time.|||In me daddy 😗|||Real estate, buy land on prime locations.|||Hey bro, just curious, what do you do professionally? Also, what tech stack do you work with, and do you have any certifications? It would really help people in Nepal who want to follow a similar career path understand the roadmap. Any advice for someone here trying to enter your field?  Now, about your investment plans. Since you’re planning to settle in Nepal, here’s my honest suggestion based on the market situation.  This is actually a good time for Nepse. The market looks weak from the surface, but fundamentally many companies are undervalued. Elections seem to be approaching, and historically the market shows positive movement during election periods. My advice is not to invest your entire amount at once. Invest slowly in percentages and average your positions. Focus on companies with solid fundamentals and reliable dividends. Prioritize dividend stability first, then gradually move toward growth-oriented stocks.  Silver looks extremely strong long-term. EV production, semiconductors, and renewable energy manufacturing are driving global demand, and many countries are hoarding silver. In the next five to eight years, the price is expected to move significantly. Accumulating silver now could turn out to be one of the smartest decisions.  If I were in your position, I would place around ten lakh in each major sector of Nepse such as hydropower, banking, insurance, hotels, development banks, manufacturing, and others. Put ten lakh in gold but only after the price corrects. Put ten lakh in silver now. Ten lakh in bitcoin as a long-term hold, not for trading.  Instead of investing in random hotels or farms that people pitch to you, invest through investment companies. They handle multiple projects, spreading risk for you. Your stake remains lower but diversified, and you don’t have to be involved in day-to-day operations.  Hydropower promoter shares are still one of the best five-year opportunities in Nepal. Promoter-level investment can give returns in a one to five ratio depending on the project timeline and IPO stage. Investing a crore has the realistic potential to become several crores in a few years if chosen wisely.  You can also partner with serious investors, realtors, or investment companies. Pooling funds with others opens access to opportunities like land pooling, apartment developments, and commercial real estate projects that individuals cannot enter alone.  At the end of the day, money grows when deployed with patience and discipline. Nepal has a lot of noise and distractions, but if you diversify properly, invest gradually, and stick to fundamentals, you’ll outperform most people who follow hype.  May God give this kind of problem to all of us.|||oho rich kid. go on a world tour. money is temporary but memories are permanent|||invest in me pls|||Mutual funds do have average returns of 8-12%/year.|||Invest in education sector it's peak|||You can also invest in india if you want your choice, our stock market is booming, for example  LG electronics india just has the biggest ipo opening of 15 billion dollars on day one.|||u/SafetyPrestigious354  Wait why would you not invest in S&P or Roth or even 401k??

I’m Mahendra. I had posted earlier about my father, who has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer. It’s an aggressive cancer, and every day since the diagnosis has felt like a battle we’re fighting with everything we have.  On 30th November, my father went through another round of chemotherapy. He’s trying his best to stay strong, and we’re doing everything we can to keep him comfortable and hopeful.  Thanks to your kindness — your donations, your prayers, your messages — we’ve been able to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far. From the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of my entire family: thank you. Every rupee, every share, every word of support has meant more to us than I can ever express.  But the fight is still far from over.  His treatment is ongoing, and the costs continue to rise with every cycle. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, tests, scans, medicines — everything is painfully expensive, and we’ve already stretched our savings and borrowings to the limit. We still have a long way to go before we can cover the full cost of the treatment he needs.  So once again, with whatever strength I have left, I’m asking for your help.  as suggested by many people living outside i have started gofundme too , but i couldn't raise much amoutnt here . if you could donate or help me to post on the fb grps or wherever there is bidesh maa basni nepali dai/didi haru . it would really mean to us in  this difficult situation.

Please support us if you can.   And if you cannot donate, even sharing the fundraiser can make a real difference.   And please  keep my father in your prayers. Your kindness is what is keeping us going.  Thank you for standing with me and my family during the hardest days of our lives.   With gratitude, hope, and love.

All they can provide is rote learning and nothing more.  Even private schools suffer from this problem, more than public ones. Private schools hire teachers for 5-10k per month for classes 1-6, do you really think any sort of learning would happen in an environment like this?|||I don't really agree with the second book. Yeah there is the issue of private schools forcing unnecessary and expensive books on students. That needs to be regulated. But no extra book feels a little backwards. The school I went to had extra books in the curriculum. And I'm really glad they did. If a school feels like the NEB curriculum isn't adequate, they should be able to add a little bit without putting extra load on students. We were forced to read multiple literature books every year, and I'm thankful that they made us do so.  Also civic sense, elections, constitutional rights, banking are supposed to be in the curriculum. The issue is with implementation. Class 8 social studies book has all the civil rights, everything about elections too. Class 10 students are supposed to know how a government is formed, how supreme court justices are appointed. The issue is with the focus on memorizing everything.   Class 9 math book has an entire section on everyday uses of maths. Interest calculation, calculating monthly installments, everything is there. Even calculating the electricity bill from meter reading is in the syllabus, and is taught. Science subjects might be facing issues due to lack of resources for labs and practical learning. But in other subjects, it's more on the teachers than the syllabus.|||The point you made on D gave me some PTSD from my primary school days.

People learn by doing — not by taking standardized tests. I highly encourage people to have life experiences. Schools and universities sprung up around 19th century because it was consistent source of revenue for schools.  Also your degree means nothing. It is simply a way for education and job market to compare you against other individuals. A sheet of stupid paper doesn’t tell me my worth.",

There were so many questions on coordination compound and also, it did not even have much questions from thermodynamics. It just had like an MCQ and one question, it was like difference between adiabatic and isothermal process. But well oh well, the paper was good enough.

At the end of the day, my 12th-grade marks won’t matter if I don’t score well in the entrance exam. My performance in the 11th-grade entrance exam was also worse because of this. I scored a decent 3.96, but I still didn’t do well in the entrance exam.  Additionally, if I fully understand all the theory and concepts, but even after studying them, I still struggle with solving MCQs. It's been 4 months since I started studying for the 11th grade, yet even the old question papers,OLD IS GOLD feel tough, despite having studied the concepts. I’m not sure what to do next.Right now, I am revising everything daily, focusing on theory first, so that once I’m done with the theory, I can focus more on solving numericals.

My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either.

They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents.

I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

This is how it works doesn't matter election or games.  The more options there are the more people are going to be fragmented and so are their ideas and their candidates' ideas.

It need equal stamps as candidate number in election. And one person can take more than 5 minute for it. If any error occur in these ranking then what? As there was around 5% error in last election. It can cause more than 50% error. We need to increase voting booth by five times. And counting vote is extremely hard.  What will we do if someone is 2nd priority of 90% but 1st priority of 5%. While someone is 1st priority of 45% but 2nd priority of 5%.  If you do reelection of top two. Who got 30% and 27% vote.

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

That's what it is supposed to do. Now make a portfolio. Having both cert + portfolio is good.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.   This makes us look inferior infront of them.|||agreed|||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali. Then when I reply in Nepali, they ask, “Why are you speaking that?” And I’m like, how the f* do you think I understood whatever bullshit you were mumbling? That’s all. But South Indians are actually good…. they don’t do this.|||mero case ma tah jun language bole nii, malai tyahi desh ko maanxe hepna thaalxa, fyi - i speak nepali,hindi, bengali(bangladesh), japanese, basic german too. cuz i speak all these like native, fluent.|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||Rent free|||\"Indian movies and serial were basically forced hindi onto us\"   How so?

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility.

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research.

Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.

I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us.

The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed.

To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend? I'm confused and upset with this interaction with my parents.",

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away.

He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??

His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area.

As someone who has lived in South Korea for 10+ years—a country with one of the best public transportation systems on the planet—coming back to Nepal feels like entering a different century.  The buses? No schedule. No reliability. Half the time you don’t even know if the bus is going to stop or just fly past you like you’re invisible. And when it does stop, you’re basically fighting for your life trying to get inside.  Microbuses? I swear these things break the laws of physics. Somehow they pack 25 people into a space designed for 12, and the conductor will still shout “aaja aaja, thau chha!” like it's a joke.  Routes? Good luck. Wanna go somewhere? You better pray you know someone who knows someone who once took that route when they were 16. Google Maps? Lol. Schedules? Double lol.  Traffic? I’m convinced Kathmandu traffic is a social experiment to test human patience.  After living in Korea—where buses arrive to the minute, subways are clean, safe, on time, and everything just makes sense—Nepal’s transportation feels like torture.  I’m not saying we need bullet trains or ultra-modern subways. I’m just saying… can we at least get buses that come when they say they will? Or like… signs? Information? Anything?  End of rant.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.

I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS.

What did those first few months feel like — mentally, financially, emotionally? * Do you ever regret your decision to move? If yes, what moments made you feel that way? And if no, what kept you motivated? * What was the reality from day one? Did you struggle to find part-time work? Was balancing study and work harder than you expected? How lonely was it, if at all? * Did your journey turn out the way you had imagined? Or did things change once you arrived? * Are you still working in IT now? If not, what pulled you away from the field? Did you find your way back eventually? * Looking back, was the move worth it for you — personally, professionally, and financially? * What would you genuinely tell someone in Nepal who is earning decently in IT and is thinking of coming to Australia as a student? Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here?

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction.",

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.

I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||Rent free|||\"Indian movies and serial were basically forced hindi onto us\"   How so?

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec.

Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

            "heading": "I’m done with Miraj Dhungana’s nonsense. This is NOT what the Gen-Z movement stood for.",
            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.

What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig. I shouted at them once and finally they stopped.|||Kavya na jau bhanxu hai Discount kei ma xaina +2 Ko lagi SXC ya sasto, ramro ma gaye hunxa for science Management ho bhane global|||Me who completed +2 in 1 lakh|||Esto mahango cha +2 aile?|||\\+2 colleges are overrated. colleges will contribute almost nothing to shape your future in +2.|||Kavya and Ace ko last year ko result kasto cha??

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

But many can't, because of Nepal's education system, which doesn't quite allow for much spare time, and if you pair that with learning some extra skills, you won't have any time left for your partner, whatsoever.      I'm not being resentful, rather this is what i have observed and witnessed. IMO, instead of indulging into some serious relationships, you should continue this casually( friends type).|||No dude, money doesn't always matter.
