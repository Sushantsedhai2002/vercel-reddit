Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us.

We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs.

They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.

            "body": "So why don’t Nepalese freak out about it? Why is no one protesting?  Honestly? Because:  1. Most Nepalese just vibe. The average Nepali is busy surviving, working, studying, or trying to get that visa. No one has the energy to fight strangers every time they say “Same thing hai na?”   2. We’re used to being ignored. Globally, Nepal = Everest + Gautam Buddha + trekking. That’s it. Our language barely enters the conversation.   3. Nepali people learn Hindi without even trying. Bollywood, TV serials, Indian YouTube, cross-border trade, songs, memes  Hindi is everywhere. Even if you never sat in a classroom for it, you’ll magically understand 80% of Hindi just by growing up Nepali.   4. Hindi influenced us… but we also influenced Hindi. Half the words are cross-shared across Sanskrit roots. It’s natural for South Asian languages to overlap. But overlap ≠ identical.   5. We’re too chill about our identity. We love our nationality, but we rarely assert it the way other countries do. We quietly adapt instead of loudly correcting people.  Meanwhile Indians think… “Nepali? Isn’t that just Hindi?”  Not all, but many Indians:  Have never heard Nepali spoken properly  Don’t know it’s the official national language of an entire country  Think it’s a dialect because it’s written in Devanagari  Assume everyone around the subcontinent speaks Hindi because Bollywood is huge   And because Nepalis speak Hindi fluently, Indians assume we learned their language, not realizing we absorbed it out of necessity, media exposure, and proximity.  Why this triggers our nationality (my pov):  Because to us:  Nepali isn't “small.” It’s our identity.  It's the language of our moms yelling at us, our jokes, our culture, our songs, our poems.  When someone reduces it to “Hindi but different,” it feels like our whole culture gets downgraded.   We’re not against Hindi. We’re not against Indians. We’re just tired of Nepali being treated like background noise.   Lastly  Nepali is not Hindi.  Nepalese know Hindi because of exposure, not because it’s taught.  Indians often don’t recognize Nepali as a separate language.  Nepalese rarely complain, but deep down, it does poke our sense of nationality.  It’s a hate in my pov.

Nepal Bhasa used to mean newari not that long ago. And the language we now called Nepali was Khas bhasa or Gorkha bhasa. Basically Nepali is cultural appropriation of Newari language 😂. And on the other hand the language we call Hindi is just Sanskritized sibling of urdu that was created during the British Raj. Both Hindi and Nepali don’t even have that long of a heritage.

Though I understand the power dynamic behind Nepalis being spoken to Hindi in Nepal by the Indians, which in my opinion kinda problematic in that context, I don't actually see any problem in people speaking in whatever language they feel comfortable with. Personally, I reply in English or use broken Hindi without putting much effort in those situations.         I am a newari guy. I don't actually care much about Nepali language aside from using it as a communication tool with fellow Nepalis. Yes, it's one of the languages spoken in Nepal, hence there's a general obligation to say that we should preserve the national langauges just like any other non-newari person will say about Newari language.      And, strictly speaking about my personal attachment or pride associated with Nepali language, it's practically zero.    So, please stop enforcing the narrative that (all) Nepalis have similar feeling towards Nepali language as the ones whose mother tongue is Nepali language.|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

Yesterday I went to the ward office to register his birth, but the secretary denied the application saying that we need to submit a marriage certificate first.  The issue is that my wife is Indian, and for her to get the required documents for a marriage certificate, she has to travel back to India and complete some paperwork there. This will delay the birth registration by quite a bit.  I urgently need the baby’s birth certificate because my US employer requires it for processing my paternity leave.  Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? What are my options here? Is there any workaround, temporary document, or alternative process that the ward office accepts in cases involving foreign spouses?  Any advice or experience would be really helpful. Thanks!",

The issues you mentioned, like prices, jobs, and economic stability, take time. These things require policy level effort.  Right now, we have an interim government whose job is to conduct an election so that a new government can be formed. Only then can things start moving forward properly. The current government is doing what it can, working on pre-election tasks, reopening corruption files, and handling other responsibilities.  The situation is calmer now, with the police force and administration slowly becoming active again. The market is still a bit unstable, though. Since many government bodies haven’t been fully active, some people are taking advantage by raising prices.  Also, with several government buildings burned or damaged, many services have slowed down. But things are gradually getting back up.  For now, nothing major can happen. The main focus is the election, and that will decide the direction of the country afterwards.|||Jhan khanchan|||Traffic lights stopped working in pokhara|||No changes. Des ko styanas.

While on the return flight back to Nepal, my dad filled my hand luggage to 17KG which was 10KG more than allowed as he said it wouldn’t be weighed again once I get the boarding pass from check in counter. I was returning alone and I had some foreign cash but I gave it all to dad as he said I wouldn’t need it in Nepal.  But then, before boarding the flight, the staff started weighing everyone’s luggage. And since my hand luggage was overweight I was asked to pay for the extra luggage. I had Nepalese rupees but I didn’t had foreign cash and I didn’t had phone at that time.  By the way there were many other passengers who had overweight hand luggage too. One passenger was trying to convince staff that his extra luggage was mostly food for his baby. And then there was this one lady who had a bunch of ceramic plates in her luggage. She was trying to destroy it on the floor before throwing in the trash.  And there was me who didn’t knew what to throw and what to keep. Like most of the things were gift from my parents to relatives back in Nepal. But then, out of nowhere a fellow passenger came to me and told me that he can give me foreign currency that and I could give him Nepalese Rupees. So, he gave me some cash but then he quickly boarded the flight as the boarding had already started. I gave the cash to the staff who also gave me some discount like he charged me for less than 10KG. I later found that fellow passenger back in Tribhuvan International Airport in the baggage claim area where I gave him the Nepalese Rupee.  One of the major reason why I travel super light in flight after that.  TLDR: Boarding for flight started but hand luggage was overweight and didn’t had cash to pay at the moment.|||I did the same thing, I signed my friend's physics lab sheet, even though my own sheets were already signed by the teacher.

When I connect it to my PC, Windows only detects it as **Universal Serial Bus (COM3)**. No fastboot, no ADB, nothing else.  Has anyone dealt with this?   **Is this a serious hardware/firmware issue and can it be fixed?**   Where can I take it for repair and what might it cost?  Any advice would be appreciated.",

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.

I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

Also you can go for a dry picnic or library date or movie date. There are painting and pottery dates as well. You can take her to an arcade. Best of luck.|||Archery jauuuu. It's fun lol|||She loves shopping bhanesi kurai sakkyoni. First date mai shopping lagdinus and spoil her.extra huncha aaru bhanda😂|||Skinny jeans chai nalagaunu aaru j lagayenu bhayo|||Buying her earrings and bangles, then watching her wear them and show them off, praising her in that moment will give you butterflies in your stomach. It's old-school love, but it still works like magic.|||Since she loves movies, anywhere you can arrange a good romcom or go directly to a cinema hall, get a coffee and share a popcorn basket. She loves shopping, so even a simple Bhatbhateni trip with her would be fun (considering the variety Bhatbhateni has), especially if they have a small bubble tea/restaurant inside the building. Or you can also let her choose a T-shirt/Hoodie/Jeans for you in a decent place (can be Bhatbhateni). I think the best a man looks in is a simple grey/black/white/blue plain colored decent shirt/pants combo which are comfortable and fit well. Maybe add a jumper on the outside for covering cold. All the best! The way you behave matters more than the way you look, so stay polite, respectful, humorous & never let her feel she isn’t safe with you.",

There were so many questions on coordination compound and also, it did not even have much questions from thermodynamics. It just had like an MCQ and one question, it was like difference between adiabatic and isothermal process. But well oh well, the paper was good enough. Now I have to study for physics whose prelims are on the 14th of December.

My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs.

Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||They speak hindi infront of us assuming we understand and speak their language.    I do the exact opposite, speak just Nepali with them lol. They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English.

Ok let's forget that and only focus on two person/party who is going on election, do you think one getting 51% means 49% of people who voted on losing ones are wrong? This is how it works doesn't matter election or games.  The more options there are the more people are going to be fragmented and so are their ideas and their candidates' ideas. So, waiting for a perfect scenario like all voters have well knowledge, awareness, thought processing and only one out of all the options are excellent to deserve 50%+ votes doesn't exist in reality. All those candidates have own views which are good/bad in their own way and so voter's expectations. So, whose idea is best or was liked by most people in count not in overall wins like you saw in the image.|||May be we can solve If we have priority system in election where voter can rank candidate from 1 to last. It need equal stamps as candidate number in election. And one person can take more than 5 minute for it. If any error occur in these ranking then what? As there was around 5% error in last election. It can cause more than 50% error. We need to increase voting booth by five times. And counting vote is extremely hard.  What will we do if someone is 2nd priority of 90% but 1st priority of 5%. While someone is 1st priority of 45% but 2nd priority of 5%.  If you do reelection of top two. Who got 30% and 27% vote. Thats mean 43% have to vote a person that they discarded once and we also remove option for them. Thats mean their last vote loose meaning. This will very wrong than today.

I'm an older American male, so my experience may not match yours, but my impression is that you'd be OK.  That said, it's really easy to find travel/trekking companions and guides are very reasonably priced, at least in Western terms.  If you're going on a trek, I'd strongly advise getting a guide for any number of reasons.  A solo female traveler from Germany died just last week, apparently because she followed a route that was on a map but had been abandoned in favor of a less dangerous route.  A guide would have taken her on the correct path.|||I think Nepal is generally considered safe for travelers, including solo female travelers. However, you have to follow common sense precautions as you would elsewhere.  The normal places that travelers go to, like the popular trekking routes, will be safe besides maybe some petty tourist scams. Off the beaten path, I'd be cautious of scammers more than of safety.   It's a very different situation when compared with India.|||It's relatively safe for travellers. But do use caution regardless, even if majority are harmless, the small minority could end up harmful.|||Super safe. Try to avoid overcrowded space just to be safe else you will be fine|||Nepal is safe for foreigners regardless of any gender.|||Most likely yes except a few regions I believe like some regions of madeshi province and few more backward and underdeveloped  regions because of conservative society.   It doesn't apply to tier 1-2 cities in nepal as people have majorly accepted modernism. Beside scammers I barely feel any threat for female travellers. Nepal is much safer country comparatively and more safer compared to South Asian countries.|||Yep quite safe actually, you might be scam at some places. Remeber you don’t need to hire guides for a lot of places. Also foreigners usually get charged more so only go to a pkace after checking the review. Also use ride sharing app: indrive, pathao etc etc which will cost you lot less than just hiring taxi from the road. Please avoid public transportation if possible. And no streed food. Incase of diarrhea eats lots of water mix with ORS and not antibiotics or anti diarrhea stuff. Seek medical help if you feel sick.|||Avoid bordering towns with india.    Rest of Nepal is safe. Overcharging tourists here and there, petty scams. Avoid creepy places as you'd in any places, basic cautions taken. It's safe.|||Are you looking for biased-opinions?

It is safe but can’t trust human nature or natural calamities.|||is safe but there always scammers and some who look at you like crazy .. don’t wear anything too revealing unless you are in club|||Yes, Nepal is generally very safe for solo travelers, including women, as others have mentioned. That said, it’s always wise to stay cautious especially in tourist areas near temples since a few people may try to sell cheap items at inflated prices.  Occasionally, someone might offer help in a friendly way but later expect money, though this is rare. Younger Nepalese, in particular, are usually genuinely friendly and happy to help without expecting anything in return, so don’t hesitate to approach them. Some older or poorer individuals might expect a small tip, but that’s not the norm. Most Nepalese are incredibly warm and welcoming win their heart, and they might even offer you food.

There’s so much to see and experience, and it’s truly worth your time once you go, you won’t regret it!|||Insane amount of downvotes for no reason on OPs replies lol. shes just asking, let her breathe people.|||Crime against foreigners is very rare in Nepal because there is a saying in Nepal - \"Athiti devo bhawa\".

I was just there a few days ago. My observations:  - There’s no decorum or order - absolute chaos. - Don’t know how to sugarcoat this, but it smells like feet everywhere. Need air flow and ventilation. - Limited cafe/restaurants in the int’l terminal - don’t know why they wouldn’t open up nicer places. People are willing to spend $ - Grateful they have chargers, but it’s placed in the middle of the walkways. How about next to the seats? - Only one water station after security - I’d add another one - Bathrooms are disgusting and totally unusable  After being back in KTM after 7 years, the city itself has grown so much.

They are the reason airport is messed up. Here is why:  1. They have no incentive to perform or change and fix what is not working. If they change anything or make things more lenient or easier they actually risk being ostracized. 2. Rules and processes are added for a really tight system and  for reducing false negatives. So need 2-3 means of verification for smallest of the procedure.  3. There is some unwarranted fear if the rules are not strict Indians and Americans will eat the country alive :p. Therefore they feel it is justified to make everything manual and cumbersome. 4. They are paid low and use any slight deviation to seek bribe.  5. They are too many of them. If things are automated we wouldn't need most of them. Why do you need to put passengers through 5 different lines and 5-10 staffs in each line. 6. Least travelled and least visionary people end up joining the service and are given a lot of power. Power trip makes them even worse. 7. They can't be fired.

It is **sacrosanct** and must not be touched for the Classic 350.  # Step 2: The Core Investment (50% - approx. ₹2,50,000)  * **Action:** Systematically invest **₹2,50,000**.    * *Suggestion 1:* Start a few **SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans)** in well-performing Equity Mutual Funds (50-60% of this amount).    * *Suggestion 2:* Invest the rest in blue-chip Nepali stocks (NEPSE) or a solid bank FD if you are extremely risk-averse. * **Purpose:** This money is for your future financial freedom. Your money is now working harder than you are.  # Step 3: The Classic 350 Fund (30% - approx. ₹1,50,000)  * **Action:** Place this **₹1,50,000** into a separate, easily accessible fund. * **The Compromise:** The Classic 350 typically costs upwards of ₹5 Lakhs, which means your ₹1.5 Lakhs is the perfect **Down Payment**. * **The Adulting Test:** Take a **manageable loan** for the remaining amount (₹3.5 Lakhs). Since you are already earning, you can pay this off over 2-3 years.  # 👑 Conclusion:  By executing the **Hybrid Compromise**, you achieve all your goals:  1. **You get the Classic 350** (satisfying your heart) without wiping out your entire savings. 2. **You begin your investment journey** and start building real wealth (satisfying your brain). 3. **You have an emergency fund** (₹1,00,000) for security.  The smartest move is to **Invest 50% / Down Payment 30% / Save 20%**.|||Petrol haldai ruinxa|||Deepseek:   💡 **Bottom line:**  Your 5 lakhs is a safety net + seed capital for future you.

Don’t jump into business without a plan.  **Maybe the smart move is:**   \\*Invest 70%, keep 20% liquid, use 10% to treat yourself (maybe a second-hand bike or a trip to clear your head).\\*  And remember—financial literacy isn’t about denying yourself joy; it’s about affording your dreams without panicking later.

Cause some people think his ethnicity is the reason, 'they don't support him cause he is a janjati.' If that was the case then people wouldn't support Kulman. I wouldn't mind if Kulman was the PM, I kinda want him to be the next PM.  Unlike Harka, Kulman is actually a chill guy. He doesn't act like a manchild, and is very professional about his demeanour.

He does not understand basic economics, legal structures, beaurocracy (he hates beaurocracy but there is no alternative to beaurocracy rather than effective beaurocracy). I remember one reporter asked about his political spectrum (right wing/left wing), he literally said \"Hami daya baya lagera ta esto bhako ni aba sidha jane ho\" and this sentence does not indicate he is a centre wing nor his actions.    He stands with his own made ideology of shram sanksriti just how prachanda made his prachanda path. we all know where prachanda path went. Infact, truly speaking prachanda path makes more sense to me than his shram sanskriti.    All he wants is control. He might be a person with integrity but he is not the competent one.|||All politicians have huge ego. Some people prefer the aesthetic of  'professional' others like man of the people, someone with whom they can strike a chia guff in a bhatti. It's all subjective.  The bigger question is does Harkae need the alliance? As the 'alliance' is still trying to figure out what it even is. Harkae is in full campaign mode and pulling huge crowds in eastern Nepal.

            "body": "everyone's watching gagan thapa's interview but watch this [https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ](https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ) video of him speaking in parliament just weeks before bhadra 23 happened. only if the government had listened to him.   Gagan thapa from what I see was always fighting within the party and was always corned because he didn't have grab on the party like deuba did. in party system, you've got to be a party leader before you can have a chance to get executive role and walk the talk. but finally he has the chance to lead the party. i really hope he does.  Gagan thapa who once used to be beacon of hope doesn't have that flair anymore. Nepali society has that tendency to make someone hero every once in a while. 2063 was Prachande, 2072 was Oli, 2080 was Rabi. Gagan Thapa was somewhere there all along as youth face until Nepali society got another hero in face of Rabi. People these days criticize Gagan Thapa for failing to deliver and not meeting the expectations. I remember people wanting Gagan Thapa to be Prime Minister back then but there's no hope from him anymore.  I personally think Gagan Thapa wasn't ready to be PM back then. Yes, his speeches sounded good, yes he had that craze , yes he was a young face in politics but he didn't have experience. Politics isn't as easy as populists think. It needs understanding of how government actually functions. If you've followed gagan thapa for past 6-7 years, he's finally being a mature political face.   after 2074, though congress lost the elections badly against NCP (oli+prachande) , Gagan thapa was constantly saying that party was going to break down on their own.  Later when Congress decided to form coalition with maobadi for 2079 elections, Gagan Thapa constatly stood against that decision and look how that turned out to be. Though Congress became first party, not a single chance to be PM.   Gagan Thapa stood against giving vote of confidence to Prachande when Oli and prachande formed government after elections. Later Prachande betrayed congress and went back to Oli.  Gagan thapa focused that congress should then be a strong opposition until next elections and shouldn't play to form government but deuba didn't listen and supported oli to form government. How that worked out for him - exit from politics by getting pun\\*ched by bunch of gen Zs and public humiliation.  When congress was in government, Gagan Thapa worked relentlessly for a couple of months on few ordinances - the one to let nepali companies invest abroad was significant one and welcomed. but soon the government started losing track and gagan thapa started criticizing the government his party was part of. just a couple of weeks before bhadra 23 happened, gagan thapa was there criticizing government by speaking in parliament. only if government had listened to him lol.  only if deuba had listened to gagan when he was suggesting deuba to take support out from government when oli decided the social media ban, thing would've turned differently.  gagan gets a lot of hate from RSP supporters for being critical about rabi's sahakari case - well, if there was no substantial proof, all 3 tiers of courts wouldn't have put him in custody. I'll say let court decide the case (and thats going to take lots of years , thats how court works in nepal).",

My suggestion: try to find something in canada or any western countries.|||If you don't have the financial means nor usable skills to get a high paying job here, I think you'll regret your decision to return now.  What did you go to school for? If I were in your shoes, I'd level up my skills even if it means going back to school to get a Master's. Save up as much as you can before leaving Canada. Maybe you can downsize to a smaller place and save money every month.  The thing is, once you get here you'll constantly be thinking about, \"if I had just saved up $20k, I could've easily... In Nepal.\" You'll be thinking \"I could've gotten a second job and saved $20k in a year.\" $20k, $30k is a fair amount of money in Canada, but in Nepal that is a shit ton of money with which you can do a lot. You could expand your small business here, or do something else with it. It won't be enough to retire on, but you'll be extremely grateful you have that in reserve.   Good luck!|||No don't return.

            "heading": "The Rabi story isn’t winning because it’s true. It’s winning because it’s surgically designed for the Nepali psyche.",
            "body": "I’m just an observer who has watched this unfold from the sidelines for some time now, neither a supporter nor a hater, but the pattern is now crystal clear. There is a reason every 40-page fact-check thread on Twitter or an elaborate news article gets 38 comments while a 12-second TikTok of Rabi walking out of custody gets 4M views and rivers of tears.It’s because the RSP narrative is one of the cleanest, most lethal political myths ever built in this country. Strip it down, and it’s three sentences:  1. A man from outside the club started winning. 2. The club panicked. 3. The club weaponised the courts to stop him.  That’s the entire gospel. Nothing else is required. And it is unstoppable for five structural reasons that have almost nothing to do with evidence.  1. It reuses villains that 90% of the population already despises. The story doesn’t have to invent enemies. It just points at the same three parties and the same dozen surnames that have been on the evening news since people were born. Defending “the judicial process” in 2025 automatically casts you as a foot-soldier for those exact villains, even if you spent the last ten years cursing them yourself. 2. It turns Rabi into a human mood ring. He is no longer a politician with files and cases. He is the physical container for every private rage Nepalis are not allowed to voice in polite company: rage at having to beg for a Malaysian visa, rage at seeing ministers’ kids studying in London. At the same time, your own degree gathers dust, rage at the simple fact that nothing ever works here. When you attack him, people don’t hear “this man might have broken laws.” They hear “you are dismissing my pain.” 3. It replaces a 400-page legal maze with a single sentence anyone can remember. Try explaining the difference between “investigation,” “remand,” “chargesheet,” and “final verdict” to a vegetable vendor in Kalimati or a mother in Jumla. You will lose them in thirty seconds. “They jailed him because he was becoming too big” is shorter than a WhatsApp forward and feels 100 % true the moment it lands. Cognitive ease beats cognitive accuracy every single time. 4. It is an infinitely customisable therapy. Every frustrated Nepali gets to insert himself as the protagonist: • The youth who prepared for lok sewa for six years and still failed? Same story. • The entrepreneur strangled by red tape and bribes? Same story. • The family that lost everything when the cooperative collapsed? Same story. The narrative is a blank template that lets millions of people scream “this is about ME” without changing a single word. 5. It is the perfect drug for a nation addicted to learned helplessness. Nepal’s modern identity is built on a thousand small and large humiliations: the blockade, the passport ranking, the airports, the brain drain, the daily proof that ordinary effort is never enough. When your entire lived experience is “the system crushes anyone who stands out,” then the sentence “they jailed him because he stood out” doesn’t sound like a conspiracy theory. It sounds like the most honest thing any politician has ever said.  This is not a media-literacy problem. This is not even mainly a class or education problem. This is a story that was reverse-engineered to fit the exact emotional wounds of an entire country . Until someone builds a counter-story that is equally simple, equally personal, and similarly cathartic, something that gives people dignity instead of just documents, the current myth will keep winning. And right now, no one is even trying. That’s the part that should worry everyone who still believes that facts alone will eventually prevail. They won’t.   Not against a myth this well-crafted.",

He isn't proven guilty but still has to go to prison. What happened to innocent until proven guilty?? Even if he was a bad guy, why does he need to stay in jail while the state gets to extend his case indefinitely?    They tried to defame him before by questioning his citizenship status.  Balen is now Lucifer and agent of India.  Kulman is now a corrupt official and needs to be arrested.  Harka is now a Christian pastor trying to spread hate and destroy our culture.   See the pattern??|||No need for your philosophical yapping about Nepalese people. Don't make things too complicated, it's as simple as following: 1. Either he is discharged innocent. 2. Or he is proven in all of the charges that are currently on going 3. Or, he is only ordered to be found guilty over minor stuffs within his entire case, which looks most likely for now for anyone who has closely read his case.   It's not that complicated, if Rabi is truly involved in fraud, the court is free to punish him, else Rabi would be so immense of a figure that no one would be able to stop, in that situation this entire prison time would be seen as an investment of fighting the unjust system all by himself.   And, personally after careful reading all the hearings of courts regarding him, it's safe to say that he won't be charged with fraud, although he won't come out as innocent either, his only mistake would be to remain in an important position and not being aware of certain clauses and regulations, that's all I think would happen to him, rest of the stuffs aren't even close to truly charge him.   and, I don't even like him, as for me, I think as a politician he is too soft, weak and sometimes naive, I don't like weak people as new faces in politics, that's my personal thoughts about his political career.   No matter whether people like him or not, they better work super hard to charge him, else he is becoming so big that these old bastards could never hope to beat him.|||Came without murdering 17k people, without money bundles buried inside house, without killing people in his way (Don't say su!c!de case)....still people have audacity to say him bad.   Oli's actions are justified according to 30% of total population of Nepal by the way for the Sept 8.  And as for cooperative scam, I am not legal expert but at abstract level, no one can jail me just because I knew someone looted money and I didn't report to authorities, clearly usko kei haat chaina bhandai cha and he is jailed like for a year maybe...what kind of law is this ??  As for GenZ protest, he went back anyways by the way, and it was the condition of riot, when entire jail authorities fled, how can you expect rabi can politely say please folks I am going out, don't come with me. ??   What if, this was all the plan of that 3 taukes??...because tyo protest pachi Rabi ko rise ekdam swabhabik thiyo, tei conspire garera Rabi lai villain dekhauna sakdaina??

Balen, Harka, Hamal, Mishra, Ujwal Thapa all are/were populist. This is an era for populists.  Ravi can retire from politics or do whatever he wants now. He singlehandedly destroyed the so called \"leaders of Big Three\" being inside of a cell.  What man needs more? Love or Hate, entire politics is centered around him since he stepped up.

Most of the people who scammed people operating sahakari are at large while he's accused for his company taking loan from sahakari which is trivial compared to all the sahakari frauds.|||Another so called Over educated Gyani who gives no solutions, can't see the big picture and is here to for what I don't even know and most probably used GPT to write all of it lol  The bottom line is \" EITHER BE THE GUY WHO BRINGS THE CHANGE OR SUPPORT THE BEST ALTERNATIVE\" which is Rabi and RSP.  We all know how judicial system functions lol sahakari kholera directly paisa chalaune manxe chai court na gai chutne ani jo directly involved nai xaina uslai bail pani na dera jail ma rakhne and you tell me we accept that haha. There's literally a video of a law student who openly challenged to name a judge and he can say which party he serves vanera lol that's how bad it is.  No one is perfect, No one is a God everyone makes mistakes the ones they're accusing him of anyone in his place could have done that (Nagrita and shaakari both). Ani I don't care if Rabi is bad person or whatever but He's the only one in this scneario who can do something postiively at scale. He'e being framed by the old school parties cause he's a threat which is more than enough sign that he will bring some change.  Why isn't he the protagonist? If not he than who lol. He didn't rise to popularity by giving speeches he did good work as a journalist, opened his own party, gave chance to educated young deserving people, we all know the quality of MPs he had vs other parties. He openly challenges the system bravely, tried doing positive stuff when he was in power.  How about you give me anyone else who has done the same being a popular political figure?  Then why is he being jailed when there's litreally no evidence of he directly manipulating funds, 100s of crore ko issue ho sahakari ko Rabi le loan leko dekhexa that's the biggest proof they have lol ani he is being denied bail while kasto kasto cases ko manxe get bailed easily.  May be work on your observation a bit lol, Its very easy to point out problems anyone can do that, How about you give some solutions?  Or just look at the bigger picture what's the best alternative and support them instead? Cause that's our only hope for some positive change.|||Hot damn, that's an excellent analysis. He was always an opportunist but he did some excellent work regarding the migrant workers. Cooperative fraud case was politically motivated, no doubt. But I forever lost respect for him after jail break incident. There are still crapload of murderers and rapists roaming the country due to him. Gen Z weren't storming the prisons to release the criminals, he lit the fire with his opportunism.|||Summary and conclusion of this post? 😮",

[Know about your personality](https://helpabroout.netlify.app/)   Some demographic questions are required, while a few are optional. At the end of the test, you’ll get your personal results instantly, and you can retrieve them later as well. I want to understand whether certain personality traits correlate with specific programming roles (like frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.).   Once I gather enough data, I’ll post the findings and conclusions publicly so anyone interested can benefit from the insights. If you’re a developer or know someone who is, I’d really appreciate your participation. Every response helps the study become more accurate.   Thank you for helping me. 🙏",

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.   This makes us look inferior infront of them.|||agreed|||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

I had to go to Gwarko (which was a new location for me), so I decided to use Indrive. The fare was way too high, so I dropped it down to a rate that I thought was okayiish. Smhow, I found a guy who accepted the proposed fare. He was an 18 yr old student living with his brother, doing +2/Indrive side by side with his Honda Shine. He’d only been doing it for 2 weeks because his brother had fractured his leg while riding for Indrive. Bro was so unfamiliar with the roads (as in, he didn’t know how to use G-Map and reach specific locations), and the old Honda Shine kept stalling itself in the middle of the road. After 30 minutes of riding, he said, Paisa pardaina, ma arko Indrive khojdinchu hajur ko lagi, but I insisted, Dhilo bhaye ni chalcha. He kept taking longer routes for shorter ones (I actually had fun, tho). After 1:30 hours, with traffic jams and his longer routes fetish, we somehow made it to the destination. I was the victim here, but I felt bad for the guy since he was new to the job, trying to be a responsible brother, and helping his brother out in need. Sometimes, it’s important to read the environment. You don’t really know what someone else is going through. I gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times lol.

I reached college 25 minutes late, got scolded, and wasnt even allowed to attend my first lecture.

            "body": "TLDR; girl i have been speaking to for over a year is going around in reddit cheating on me behind my back.     I went to meet her a couple of days back, she and I have been speaking for a year now, we were thinking of being official soon as well. It was me, her and 2 more friends, it was a double date situation. she and another girl went to washroom and they were taking a while. i saw some notification popping up in her phone. i dont really use anyone's phone so i was not trying to check but the other friend started saying how he wants to check that notification since he does the same of his girl. i thought if it was from my parents maybe i should inform her so let me just glance at it. turns out it was a text of her from a guy in reddit. i scrolled slighty and found that they had been talking for like 4 days.  my heart sank when i saw that she was calling him daddy, baby and whatever. (mind you, she doesnt still know his name at this point,), she was making very sexual comments and this time, all of this was happening without the boy bringing it up. I scrolled a bit down, it was conversation from Sunday. That day when we were on call, she said she was not feeling well and wanted to sleep soon around 10, turns out she texted him at 10:10 saying \"i am super horny right now, send me your shirtless pic\", the boy does it, she follows up with \"send me your d\\*ck pic and i will send you my nudes.\" again the boy has done it. she follows up with \"i like how you look, lets meet up.\"  i was devastated. That time when i checked her phone, turns out the boy was texting her to meet this friday. she came back from washroom and i just informed her that she got a text, for the first time, she opened her phone while hiding it from me. she chose to angle the phone in such a way that i cant view it at all.  i asked if everything is ok, she asked did you see kasko text thiyo, i just said \"not really, I didnt check, is everything fine?\" she replies \"ahh sathi ko thiyo\"  and the more devastating thing here is the fact that there are multiple other DMs there, so dont think its her first time. But i see you now woman. i see what you want to do. During initial month of us talking, you went to every chats and DM i had to make sure i was not someone who would DM anyone or just hoeing around. Turns out, you are the one who is hoeing right now. I remember her talking about how her friend cheating was justified because everyone should have options, you tried to cover it saying that you werenot like that. but look at you now.   I know you are going to read this post since you are always active here. And so i say this to you, you are I are done. F\\*ck this shet. If you were open to me about not wanting me and looking to find new people, I would have been fine with it but going behind my back, its unacceptable.  Yours truly.",

            "body": "I just returned back to Nepal from California, US.   I know i post about money a lot because reddit is the only place i can share openly apart from my mom dad and baini.   I make $7500/m which equates to 10 lakh+ per month.   Land prices seem to have peaked.   Fixed Deposit gives peanut returns.   Gold is at all time high, so better not to put on gold right now.   Stock market is too weak and fragile of Nepal.   Buying and renting a house doesnt give much return.   3 crore house gives 2 lakh per month income in US, in Nepal 50k or less.   People know I make good money, they dont know how much exactly, so people solicit me to invest in their hotels, goat farms, poultry farm, which i dont trust them unless im actively involved.   I dont invest in US markets, 401k, S&P, indexes, I have it all but I want to invest in Nepal as I plan to live in Nepal forever.   I'm here in Kathmandu, with just cash in bank not knowing what would be the best use of it or where to invest properly so the wealth grows overtime.   I am not necessarily seeking risk free investments, I know every investment carries risk.   But I want to put you in my shoes to crowdsource opinion.   1. Where would you invest 1 crore a year disposable income?   2. If you're already a high income earner, where are you investing your money?   3. What areas or industries you think will do in the next 20 years.   Also, if you think im lying, just move on with other posts and keep the thread to people who are here to drop genuine opinions.",

Clear/deduct principal on any loans (assuming you have none) 2. Buy/Build a house for me and the family (assuming you already own) 3. NEPSE (if you have time, not doing a full time job actively) 4. PMS instead of NEPSE directly (will save my time in exchange of some fee) 5. SIPs 6. Buy Gold and silver in small amounts monthly 7. Keep 2x my monthly income in a basic savings for emergency 8. Keep some amount liquid 9. If earning in dollars, Keep the amount in dollars (dollar account) and withdraw only what is needed.  Basically diversify investments and save myself my time when possible. Higher risk/reward investment plan would be starting a business, investing in startups, etc. And housing, land requires large capital, so I would not go into it until I have more capital after doing the above.|||If you earn 10 lakhs per month then why are you scared to invest in Gold?

But, now I am here, it makes sense🤣🤣.|||Every time I read post like this, I get very curious. And you keep adding more information in your comments, which don’t add up at all.   Only way you can do US job while in Nepal is if you are USC or GC holder (up to 6 months remote). Either way, job market in US is going downhill, why company will pay you extra if they can get same skill or better, lot cheaper by outsourcing your job. If their policy already allows doing their financial tasks from Nepal. I am sure there are tons of people dying to get those jobs in 1/4th of your pay.  Second, If you are USC, then forget about investing in Nepal, it will be really hard (from Nepal Gov side). And also, you will still pay all taxes in US, including federal, state (with some conditions and California is aggressive about that), social security and Medicare, which comes close to 25-30% depending on state.   Third, you keep saying you went to top 20 University here, which means you have spent fortune there unless you got majority as grants. Which means, either you are very smart or rich. In both case you are deeply vested here in US and there is no way you can forget all that and go back to Nepal. If you have enough wealth to pay top 20 Universities then why bother working late night, if you have received grants then you already saw greater opportunities in US.  Fourth, you said, you don’t invest in 401k, and you said your major is finance. A person with finance degree doesn’t want to invest free money they get from company? Most companies do 3 to 6% match, why you’ll leave money on the table? Especially you can choose if you want to invest it in volatile or stable options.  There are tons of red flags, which I can keep adding and make my comment longer but in short your own comments disagree with what you are saying.  Why I am writing this long comment? Coz you are disturbing fake dream to Nepali youths, trying to prove that life is so easy once you go abroad. Which is not. Where is your story about your struggle? How did you come to US? What did you do before you get financial job? How did you pay for your college? Is there any struggle your parents did to send you to one of the top 20 University?|||I think you should invest in potential startup if you have certain knowledge about how this system works?|||What do you do that makes you this much money?|||Ma chai long term ko lagi ramro dividend bonus history vako large cap ma monthly invest gardai xu  Nepse ma. certain amount yesai bank ma xa for emergency and rainy days and loan to people chai good source of income vako xa 20% jasto interest dinxan manxe haru.

I told one of my friend to buy that trump meme coin, and dump it all the next day, he earned some good cash that time lol. That's just how it it, I would say the dip in crypto is pretty heart breaking though, but I would still do it if I had access like you. * **Franchising / Business Investments**: Invest in established franchises for a reliable income stream or use your capital to start a business in high-demand sectors like food or retail.  One question:   I too work in a US based company, it's good, but not as good as 10 Lakh per month, if you don't mind could you share what sector you work??

Also, what tech stack do you work with, and do you have any certifications? It would really help people in Nepal who want to follow a similar career path understand the roadmap. Any advice for someone here trying to enter your field?  Now, about your investment plans. Since you’re planning to settle in Nepal, here’s my honest suggestion based on the market situation.  This is actually a good time for Nepse. The market looks weak from the surface, but fundamentally many companies are undervalued. Elections seem to be approaching, and historically the market shows positive movement during election periods. My advice is not to invest your entire amount at once. Invest slowly in percentages and average your positions. Focus on companies with solid fundamentals and reliable dividends. Prioritize dividend stability first, then gradually move toward growth-oriented stocks.  Silver looks extremely strong long-term. EV production, semiconductors, and renewable energy manufacturing are driving global demand, and many countries are hoarding silver. In the next five to eight years, the price is expected to move significantly. Accumulating silver now could turn out to be one of the smartest decisions.  If I were in your position, I would place around ten lakh in each major sector of Nepse such as hydropower, banking, insurance, hotels, development banks, manufacturing, and others. Put ten lakh in gold but only after the price corrects. Put ten lakh in silver now. Ten lakh in bitcoin as a long-term hold, not for trading.  Instead of investing in random hotels or farms that people pitch to you, invest through investment companies. They handle multiple projects, spreading risk for you. Your stake remains lower but diversified, and you don’t have to be involved in day-to-day operations.  Hydropower promoter shares are still one of the best five-year opportunities in Nepal. Promoter-level investment can give returns in a one to five ratio depending on the project timeline and IPO stage. Investing a crore has the realistic potential to become several crores in a few years if chosen wisely.  You can also partner with serious investors, realtors, or investment companies. Pooling funds with others opens access to opportunities like land pooling, apartment developments, and commercial real estate projects that individuals cannot enter alone.  At the end of the day, money grows when deployed with patience and discipline. Nepal has a lot of noise and distractions, but if you diversify properly, invest gradually, and stick to fundamentals, you’ll outperform most people who follow hype.  May God give this kind of problem to all of us.|||oho rich kid. go on a world tour. money is temporary but memories are permanent|||invest in me pls|||Mutual funds do have average returns of 8-12%/year.|||Invest in education sector it's peak|||You can also invest in india if you want your choice, our stock market is booming, for example  LG electronics india just has the biggest ipo opening of 15 billion dollars on day one.|||u/SafetyPrestigious354  Wait why would you not invest in S&P or Roth or even 401k??

And don't use mobile for notes too  if possible . Psychologically you are using the same device for entertainment and for notes it will  distract you .  Gradually increase your study time like add 20 to 30 min per 3 days and after one month make the break time of 10 min without mobile phone  That's it you will score brilliant grade at the results|||1 year aghi ma ni same situation ma thiye lol, Ma chai management bata ho so no idea about your syllabus and course hai.

There were so many questions on coordination compound and also, it did not even have much questions from thermodynamics. It just had like an MCQ and one question, it was like difference between adiabatic and isothermal process. But well oh well, the paper was good enough.

I plan on completing it today and tomorrow combined because tomorrow I have leave from my coaching and I will not go to college. So let's see. If anyone wants questions, just dm.",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia). I know how hard it is to face all those problems at once and especially, if you are the only hope of the family handling everything.  Praying for your dad’s full recovery and may god give you strength to handle the pressure you are facing.  Did a small contribution. Please please stay strong, that’s the main thing you have to do for your family.|||Thank you so much each and everyone feeling grayeful for the love and support you guys been providing thank you have now words to say... Thank you 🙏|||If only I wasn't jobless and broke.   Sorry, I could only afford a small amount.   Remember you need to be well enough as well and any other carers.

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either. Only know old ones which I was forced to watch with my mom.|||[deleted]|||[removed]|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||Absolutely agree! Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason. Have been seeing this for decades now.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||They speak hindi infront of us assuming we understand and speak their language.    I do the exact opposite, speak just Nepali with them lol. They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents. I work with Pakistanis tho and it’s the same case for them too.|||I can speak almost Indian passing Hindi (PUBG lobbies lol) but I never speak Hindi with Indians in the US.|||I'm also in Canada. Whenever someone tries to speak hindi to me, I just stare at them until they finish talking and go \"huh?\" and keep repeating until they realize I can't understand them. F indians",

            "body": "Okay I need to rant for a second.  As someone who has lived in South Korea for 10+ years—a country with one of the best public transportation systems on the planet—coming back to Nepal feels like entering a different century.  The buses? No schedule. No reliability. Half the time you don’t even know if the bus is going to stop or just fly past you like you’re invisible. And when it does stop, you’re basically fighting for your life trying to get inside.  Microbuses? I swear these things break the laws of physics. Somehow they pack 25 people into a space designed for 12, and the conductor will still shout “aaja aaja, thau chha!” like it's a joke.  Routes? Good luck. Wanna go somewhere? You better pray you know someone who knows someone who once took that route when they were 16. Google Maps? Lol. Schedules? Double lol.  Traffic? I’m convinced Kathmandu traffic is a social experiment to test human patience.  After living in Korea—where buses arrive to the minute, subways are clean, safe, on time, and everything just makes sense—Nepal’s transportation feels like torture.  I’m not saying we need bullet trains or ultra-modern subways. I’m just saying… can we at least get buses that come when they say they will? Or like… signs? Information? Anything?  End of rant. I just needed to scream into the void.",

The public transportation will develop only when the president (or netas) have to take the bus, natra it's not their problem, and will never be overhauled.  \\[Addendum: I am very uninvolved in politics and decision making. But if anybody is in the position to make demands or make reforms, I think we should make a law that public servants (neta, mantri, president) and their family can only use public things (e.g. public school, public hospitals, and public transportation), no private sector for them by law.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.

            "body": "I’m Nepali, living in Canada, and I’ve completely stopped speaking Hindi and honestly, it changed everything for me.  I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction.",

They should be worrying about themselves.|||My opinion is that people should use whatever language they know that works to their advantage.  In your case, it was beneficial to speak in English to avoid having your coworkers discriminate against you.  On some occasion, the ability to speak Hindi can be beneficial.  It depends on circumstance.|||same lol, arko nation ko manchhe sanga bolda kheri universal language ma bolnu parchha bhanne pani tha hudaina yiniharu lai. sidhai hindi ma bolna aauchan. jhyamma diu jasto. uniharu kai language ma bolnu parne jhai|||I have lots of Indian friends too.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.   This makes us look inferior infront of them.|||agreed|||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec.

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

            "heading": "I’m done with Miraj Dhungana’s nonsense. This is NOT what the Gen-Z movement stood for.",
            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He's only at this stage cause of racism that pushed social workers like Sudan aside \"chinese, indian\" accusations ley.

He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.

What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ...

They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Gradually increase your study time like add 20 to 30 min per 3 days and after one month make the break time of 10 min without mobile phone  That's it you will score brilliant grade at the results|||1 year aghi ma ni same situation ma thiye lol, Ma chai management bata ho so no idea about your syllabus and course hai.

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia). I know how hard it is to face all those problems at once and especially, if you are the only hope of the family handling everything.  Praying for your dad’s full recovery and may god give you strength to handle the pressure you are facing.  Did a small contribution. Please please stay strong, that’s the main thing you have to do for your family.|||Thank you so much each and everyone feeling grayeful for the love and support you guys been providing thank you have now words to say... Thank you 🙏|||If only I wasn't jobless and broke.   Sorry, I could only afford a small amount.   Remember you need to be well enough as well and any other carers.

And when you say indo gangetic plain , it includes bangladesh and parts of pakistan too. Its a regional problem. And being north of these countries, well , you get plenty of emissions carried by the wind which dissipates in our mountain ranges.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again.

We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs.

They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.

Same civilization, same geography same economy. A border got created a few hundred years back doesn't make us special, if anything this attitude is the problem.  In winter the cold air keeps pollution trapped, neither blowing away nor washing down. Everything contributes here - India contributes according to its size and population, and so does Nepal. We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend? I'm confused and upset with this interaction with my parents.",

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.

His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support.

You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.   This makes us look inferior infront of them.|||agreed|||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec.

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

            "heading": "I’m done with Miraj Dhungana’s nonsense. This is NOT what the Gen-Z movement stood for.",
            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate. Let's get it 💪|||.|||Clips ki video xaina yo post KO?|||Sabai opportunistic cha kasai lai wastai chaina euta main leader nai chaina euta ley aafno party kholya cha arko yo vaye na tyo vayeh na arko paila ko party haru ley movement start garya cha genz yeta euta kei garna sakya chaina.|||movement was leaderless but quite not. but even then the aftermath can't go on like that leaderless, shapeless, formless, faceless. why don't u go take his job?|||He doesn’t know How politics works.|||so its oli/prachande/deuba jhole vs sudan jhole vs durga jhole vs miraj jhole vs ck raut jhole now   hahahahaha  mathi ko main madaari hasi ra hola goti haru ko activity dekhera|||k ho reason chai hate garnu ko? k kura garyo genZ movement represent nagarne?|||Kaam garne kaalu|||No doubt young generation is powerful and should be in politics too.

No achievements whatsoever and he jumped at the chance to be of anything noteworthy without doing anything.|||Yo, Sudan Gurung, etc. are all jokers. Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

I mean she ain't wrong...still have the Sharia law implemented on Iran, Saudi arabia, Afghanistan. You see these and say women aren't oppressed currently? She isn't talking about Muslim communities in our country as per this clip. But rather the women oppression on those countries which is very strictly and religiously done by Muslim countries.  I mean ppl still believe on 100% Sharia law even Muslim scholars disagree with Sharia law. She ain't wrong abit Society has always been patriarchal, not 100% wrong with this sentiment but If rule of oppression is set based on the religious values you'll be criticized.

Khatey khatua haru|||She didn’t say anything bad about musims living in Nepal. Its weird how Muslims were celebrating Mamdanis election win as their own, taking pride in it. Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

I did not think people here would defend this government even for this shit, this is something old fucks at least tried not to say.

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone. But I am ok now. Ek barsa drop liye and gave entrance exams again, BHOLI results aaudai chha and I feel positive about the results.  I honestly believe 11 ko results le kei matter gardaina. Ramrari padeu bhane mazza le ramro gpa lyauna sakinchha. Here's a quick tip for you...  1.Sab teacher ko chhutai chuttai notes banau and make sure to store them safetly.  2.

Napadhne keta haru sanga aali kam sangat rakha, also if you're talking to a girl ( romantically) make sure it doesn't take a lot of your time and energy.

You do have enough time after plus two.  well, ma pani college ma kehi bujhdina thiye but I managed to score 3.9 in 12th final jyst by watching youtube at peak time.  hope tou do your best. by the way science aint that difficult as people exaggerate if you just go with syllabus.|||Chill 12 ko grade katai matter gardaina tei abroad jane bhane ho aba ramro gare hunchha|||No this aint the end,I had a B+ in SEE without studying at all cause I was carefree,had an A in 11 and an A in 12 and yes I took science cause I had interest in it and no I didn't study my ass off,I just put consistent effort.If I could do it u are a hardworking student for sure,U can surely do it.U have a high chance to improve english,nepali.B's in english and nepali is not that good.|||Nah it's fine twin  Bhujhera padha aba bata ramrari all the best|||dont panic. class 10 ko ra 11 ko format haru farak huncha. first time exam didai xau tei pani yesto ramro aako xa (yo result ramrai ho) ma 11/12 ko most exams haru ma literally fail vako ho. i can confidently say ki timle aaile laga ko effort vanda halka dherai matrai lagayeu vane pani timro result babbal aaucha.  if in case socheko jasto khassai vayena vane pani kei xaina. exams haru dherai aauchan. 11 ma ali chill ma basa. 12 ma gaye paxi baru ali seriously padhna thala. that does not mean im telling you to take 11 lightly. foundation banaune yetai ho.|||broda ngl 11 ko internal exam ma esto pressure naliga learn to chill and keep your brain relax although you need to lock in for finals cause bdesh jana gpa chainxa nai tapani dehrai mental stress ligera padhni kam nagara +2 isn't the time to loose mental health life get's more tough from here on out|||Maile plus two St.Xaviers bata gareko.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail. I being a metro scholar failed real bad my terminals. It shook all the confidence within me, had me go through lots of bad mouthing from my own parents. So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track. You can put in half the efforts but improve further than me, don't be sad your marks degraded rather try improvising new study methods to help you improve.|||You do realize that there are ppl who will absolutely kill for your current grade right?|||Bro mero ni SEE ma 3.9 aako thiyo ani 11 ko first term ma 2.9 muskil le (I was from sci background) pachi 12 ma balla talla push garera 3.65 lyauna safal bhaye|||SAT is the only thing that can save you my sister/brother|||mero 11 ma 3.7 ani  12 ma 2.62 xa|||listen   you have got a+ IN COMPUTER   looks like you will do very good in tech  do tech degree bachelors ma   just my suggestion !|||ye sab moh maya hai Balak.|||This guy thinks getting 3.10 GPA is the end of the world🤣🤣🤣|||what do you mean its the END ? have you learned to give up this easy ? tetro SEE ma 3.97 lyayeko aba aayera yesari easily ta give up dont do brother. you got it myan its not the end   bharkhar ta suru bhayo lmao   still have time to improve   Goodluck|||good enough gpa for terminal exam mero 3.08 aako thyo 11 ko first term ma 12 ko boards ma got 3.79|||🤣🤣 don't overthink, this happens to everyone.|||Dw at all.

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics.

Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle.

I'm not being resentful, rather this is what i have observed and witnessed.
