While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it’s 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I’m happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He’s an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn’t benefit from it.  My father isn’t happy here  It’s been over 10 years and he’d say that if I said I wanna go back he’ll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) “Tell your father this. ‘Dad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?’ If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He’s here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him —just him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn’t want to leave his family here”  I then said “dad’s gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That’s what he said”  Grandma “he said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you’re always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn”   Me “but, I like it here”  Grandma  “Do you love your dad or not? He’s done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He’s 53 now. Come to Nepal. I’ve got money to pay for your school fees”  That’s when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it’s especially hard in the hot son as he’s an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn’t like it heere and he’s much happier everytime we’re in Nepal.  My dad did say “we should’ve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick” But I’m 23 now  And I don’t wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He’s an amazing person who’s gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say “I want to go back to Nepal” he’ll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the “power” but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here’s what she said “Your dad is 50 now. He’s been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don’t let me stop you but if I was in your place, I’d come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors”  I hate it. Also my grandma isn’t a bad person  My aunties  1 is in US 2 are in Canada  And 1 is in Nepal  So grandma lives Alone The auntie that’s in Nepal stays with her.  So Idk what to do I’ve got an Australian license. I’ve built a life here  I’m studying and don’t work atm  I’m an Australian citizen I wanna cry. I feel like I’ve failed as a daughter.",

Would it make him happy if u agreed? Of course. But that's your choice to make.|||No. Anyone who says \"oh your dad's done so much for you\" and tries to blackmail you is a terrible person.   Also, move to Nepal and do what? You grew up in Australia.. you're more in touch with Australia than you are with Nepal...

Let's say your entire family migrates back to Nepal and you and your brother fail to have a  good future here.        Do you think your father will be happy?       He will blame himself.       So will you after some times.           Convince your dad to take long vacations in Nepal now and then.        That will help ease the homesickness.   Don't let your emotions ruin your future ahead.     |||honestly i haven't read half of what you have written but i will say:  We all acknowledge your father love toward his motherland. but nepal isn't so good in condition rn basic facilites are expensive and hard to get. So stay there now for the sake of your brother and when you start to earn to support your family send your parents here the facilites maybe less but the pleasure is unmatched anywhere in the world. and seeing your condition you might me a australian citizen even so visit nepal sometimes and never forget your motherland and who you are.   \\[Just some emotional and logical dialogues your father will melt thinking my daughter is matured enough to say this and stay happily.\\]   you can dm if you want any help. :)|||It’s simple: J sukai gara! It doesn’t matter. There is no right or wrong options here. You are a nice daughter anyways since you are thinking for him, thinking about him. Nothing else matters. Tetai basey ni it’s good. Farkey ni it’s good. No need to listen to many people and make it complicated.|||if you can afford, you can come to Nepal with your family and enjoy a vacation here but not fast paced khale. Spare some time like a month or so and enjoy a laid back life for some days. He is probably exhausted being in a foreign land. But you can have your own preferences of living here or there permanently.|||I have seen many cases like that. Send your father Nepal for few years I bet you $1000 he will be back to Australia. My friend family leave USA for good because his parents wanna go back to Nepal. They purchase land and properties and lived for 3 years in Nepal but they’re back again in US after selling their house and land.   They can’t live without their kids. And their kids basically grown up in US. They love and know US more then they know about Nepal.|||Never needed to post this as your grandmother and cousin said it best but if you really want to make your happy, convince your mother to consider her husband’s happiness too as you said he’s not happy and you should complete your studies. Consult with your family about each others needs but for you tell them that you are considering to go back to Nepal temporarily but will return as even after completing studies you won’t get better job opportunities in Nepal and even then you’ll visit your family.

People were expecting some kind of stand from him during that time and even after protest but he remained silent. His supporters says that it's him being strategic and waiting for the election.

What I've noticed is that some of the member of this cyber sena are making anti Balen posts and pay to boost them on Facebook. And the same cyber sena will like all the hate comments in the post so that a regular viewer will be able to view only the hate comments against Balen. That's where even Balen's regular supporters have started to doubt him. Even Harke has started his own cyber sena.

Unfortunately Nepalese are so emotional, they are very easy to manipulate. They lack critical thinking.  But personally, I don't like Balen as well(after GenZ protet).

He could've lead the whole country and youths. Nobody would even raise a finger on him if he even became PM, but all he knows is write fb posts.  Now GenZs are all divided. I've heard there are more than 30 big GenZ factions. 76 dead in aandolan for what? After influencing youths to protest and inciting rage by declaring KP Oli as terrorist, all this guy does is write fb posts.  Even at the current state where country's people are so divided as Rajabadi, Rabi badi, Balen badi, Harka badi, Old parties badi, etc etc etc and GenZs seem like maau binako challa, he is still silent. I believe he still has the power to unite youths but all he does is write some fb posts.  BALEN FEELS LIKE HE IS SO IRRESPONSIBLE, UNACCOUTABLE, and UNEMPATHETIC.  Maybe most people feel the same as me and at this point, people will fall to negative media manipulation.|||I used to take stand for balen against my parents but now I myself don’t like him.

They only give u 6 months of warranty too but still I reached out and complained and they said I should visit their baneshwor branch in which they told me that my powerbank was one of the first batches which was deployed with problematic boards and needed to be replaced. But, they didn't have the board at the time so they told me to contact them the next month. The power bank was completely useless at this point cuz it wouldn't even charge my phone upto 5% and it would drain really quickly and turn off after 75%. I tried to reach the customer support but they just keep delaying and are very hard to communicate with. Once i told them \"huh\" and they replied \"Okay sir\" like wth. It's outrageous cuz I paid 4k for this thing and it stops working in mere 9 months. I would've opted for xiaomi or other brands instead.

After following up again, they finally asked for my bank statement and transaction details. Only then was the missing amount credited to my eSewa account.  Now imagine someone in an emergency tries to load money, and the first attempt fails, but the amount is deducted. Naturally, they try again. The second attempt works, and the money is credited. But the first deducted amount remains unaccounted for unless the user remembers and takes the time to go through the whole complaint process.  This is unacceptable.   I think I’ve had enough of eSewa’s unreliable service. I’ll be switching to Khalti moving forward.",

By the second day, the damage to the bezel had worsened. From the third day onward, the laptop chassis—the body connecting the keyboard and the screen—began to break. Several hinges and attachment points also started to fail simultaneously.  Recently, I showed the laptop to a local repair person in my village. They mentioned that they couldn’t repair it completely. The main issues are the damaged laptop chassis and the broken screen bezel. They also noted that repairing these components would be costly, possibly exceeding NPR 10,000.  I would like to know if anyone can verify this estimate the price it will take me to repair",

I’ve been thinking seriously about switching my career into **Digital Marketing and SEO**, but I’m still a bit unsure if it’s really worth it in the current time.

I’ve noticed a lot of people online working remotely in this field, but I’d love to hear some real experiences or suggestions from those who are already in it.

Try exploring your interest and find a very specific niche to excel in.|||Many companies in Nepal just do mediocre SEO ...basic on-page fixes, keyword stuffing, random blogs. You might make quick money if you’re good at sales, but that’s not real SEO.  In real companies, you actually learn. You get access to advanced tools, data, and analytics. You work with experts as mentors, in specialized teams for every single task... technical SEO, content strategy, link building, automation, reporting. There are SOPs, structured workflows, and a culture of measuring impact, not just rankings. You get exposure to complex client sites, real problems, and strategies that move actual business metrics. That’s where you develop skills that are rare and in-demand globally.  So, your first goal must me getting in a company who knows what they're doing. That's the toughest part, and then curiosity will make you successful.|||Remind me! 1 day|||Switch from what?",

Dr. Govinda KC advocates for govt funded medical colleges with 75% scholarship seats to be established in underserved areas but these mafias don’t let him do that. Instead, they want to increase the seats in their private colleges. Mind you, fee 40-45 lakhs vaye ni they charge well over 60-70 lakhs; especially ku affiliated colleges like kmc, noble etc. medical education commission ko rule mai medical students lai college ko hostel optional huna parney rule cha but these people make it compulsory and charge absurd amount of fees; normally monthly 10-15K hostel fee huna parney ma, they charge 30-35K.   Most private medical colleges currently have 100 seats but capacity 50-60 students ko cha. Yet, they somehow convinced oli to intercept and increase the seats to 120-130. The retarded oli, prachande, shere had always favored these medical mafias and these people probably give hefty chanda to their parties. Desh ma kei bipat aauda, they act like they are providing service but in reality, patients lai ni ekdam lutcha.

If there's difference in opinions, then you can leave that party and join another or form another. They can work under different names for the same goal. They both can have their own internal party politics but outside of that, they can work together for the same goal, that is, to bring down old political parties.  The new party will have to join forces with RSP. Sagar Dhakal could run from Dadeldhura from new party like last time. RSP didn't send their candidates in constituencies like this. The same thing could happen but two parties means people who are skeptic of Rabi will have another option. As long as they don't run against each other, it should be fine.

It would also make an option for RSP haters and the ones who aren't sure if they should vote RSP in the proportional representative. It will make sure the one who doesn't like RSP doesn't end voting for the Big 3 again.

When I focused on myself and improved I met people who were fond of me and even woman who were open to get to know me romantically. I realized my worth.   Ultimately its all about confidence. Not even money. You need confidence in life, and its the kind of confidence thats unshakable now that I am looking for.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "No. The reforestation campaign in Nepal has been really exemplary. The concept of Community Forests has been modal and it has had a massive impact on the  green coverage. The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

Thanks to Maobadi|||Worried about wildfire possibility in the future. the local government doesn't do a great job of managing dead trees. We are already seeing a previously never seen fire season.|||The reforestation and forest conservation is one of Nepal’s successful endeavor. And yet the old generation say that ‘sabai forest fadisakyo’ or say ‘paila kati hariyali thiyo’. However I’d say it needs more effort and forest fire is a serious issue.|||Here's an in-depth international piece on it from NZ's Māori television:   https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/04/22/re-greening-a-country-the-story-of-nepals-community-forests/|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||Kehi Haina aajkal maanxe haru hills xodera flat Tira migration vaye, gas maa reliant vaye , Gai goru, bhaisi paalna xode.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers. As ice melts there’s more land for forest to flourish.|||Hariyo bun nepalko dhan…|||Also there's a study which shows earth is more covered by forest than 50 years ago.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

Turns out my curtains are almost transparent when the room light is on.  Now I’m panicking, thinking my neighbors might have seen everything that happens in my room for months. I feel so embarrassed and disgusted. They may have seen me masturbate as i do it regularly.  I don’t even want to switch my lights on anymore. I just want to hide. I cant shift to other places cause its my own home. How do I face them now? Should I just act normal and pretend nothing happened?",

Over time, they blended with Magars, Gurungs, Tamangs, Tharus, Newars, Rai, Limbu  everyone. Nepal’s always been a crossroads, not one ethnicity.  Even though most of us are Hindu, our culture feels different  the way we celebrate Dashain and Tihar, our food, our family values. Historically, Nepal meant the Kathmandu Valley, the Newar homeland, while the hills were a buffer between Tibet and the plains. Our roots have always been both Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman.  I get what the OP means in a modern sense, Nepali and Indian identities are different. I studied in India, and the culture there feels more urban, loud, individualistic, while Nepal’s is quieter, collective, shaped by the mountains.  India itself is diverse Kashmiri to Tamil, Kerala Muslim to Bengali Muslim, Bihari to Rajput   all different. It’s a republic of many ethnic states the struggle for Gorkhaland in Darjeeling was just that a struggle for an ethno state.   So when people say “Indian influence,” I don’t get it. We share civilizational ties, sure but Nepal isn’t India, and India isn’t one thing either.|||Hmm I am from Uttarakhand and I could say along with Himachal Pradesh the Hilly cultures are similar but the planer ganga yamuna belt is quiet different from us as well.|||   India is diverse in the sense that you have every kind of caste and race living in the same country, but in separate states and with different languages. In Nepal, though, people live under the same roof, speak almost the same language, and nobody finds it weird  like a Gurung family living right beside a Newar family and all.  Also, in Nepal, the garbage truck comes every week, so we all go out together to throw our trash. But in India, that’s not so common. It’s kind of a Nepali national culture now  your mom screaming, “Throw the garbage! The truck’s here!” 😄|||India itself is diverse. There's no general indian. So yeah some part of India be similar to you. Not whole india cause there's no universal culture in India.|||It just shows how little you know about India.  India is one of the most diverse countries in the world.   The culture of Uttarakhand is indistinguishable from the culture of Sudurpaschim and adjacent regions.   Same goes with culture of Sikkhim, Bengal and Eastern Nepal.   Your definition of Nepal is very narrow and shows that you only think of Terai and Madesh as different while the rest of Nepal as a monolith.|||lol the differences that you are talking about can be seen from one Indian state to another, India itself does not have one common way of celebrating Dashain or Tihar, common social values, food tradition, etc. No matter how much we try to differentiate ourselves from Indians that's the most similar we are to any other country.|||Why do you think only Madesh has similar culutre to India? We all celebrate Dashain and Tihar(dfferent reason and rituals). Our family values are similar when it comes to education, marriage and relatives and elders. Our spending patterns are similar. Our language in structure are also similar. (Compare nepali to chinese or english that would be different).    India itself is a diverse country which makes it impossible to generalise it. So comparing nepal to one part of India is a statistical error. As Nepal borders with Tibet, its influence is observed in our culture and becasue Northern Nepal is hilly contrast to plains in south, lifestyle changes to adapt to it. But it is again similar to people in Uttarakhand or Northeast India.|||Depends on what part of India you are referring to? India is extremely diverse and Nepali culture - as it is - is more similar to Indian Culture than culture can be between different parts of India. Remember, the India we think of today is British India, but before that Nepal was no different than any other kingdom in the Indian subcontinent. Our festivals, rituals and customs are the same with superficial regional differences. Buddha and Sita both associated with India were Nepali. We are the same people, same broad culture just different nationalities.|||Compared to everyone else like west, China, Pakistan and stuff. Our culture is more similar. Maybe that is the reason.|||Because Nepalese copies indians and indian culture, it's that simple. Just like India people here are also brainrot. While india politics divide people by religion and here also politicians divide people based on parties and biasness. South Asia is Backwards Comparing other. Literacy rate is down, people are divided, education is crime here, Leaders are Clown and People are slaves|||Because India itself is extremely diverse. People from Punjab, Tamil Nadu, & Manipur are drastically different from each other yet they’re all considered Indian. Nepal also largely under that broader umbrella of Indian cultural variation.|||because we share almost same religion, culture, languages, foods, festivals, etc and etc... plus an open border with zero security and surveillance  because the so called Nepalese hate Madheshi due to these sharing characters   because most of the politicians did their Alma Mater from Indian universities   because we enjoy Indian movies   because we lack civic sense like as Indian  because Nepal does its business mostly from India  etc  etc|||To everyone else not in India and Nepal, you are exactly the same.||| Because we are? If you were to choose one culture that we are most similar with, which one would you choose?   The areas near India will have cultural ties with Indian states that are near Nepal; thats how most countries work. Would you not say Korean or Japanese culture is similar to Chinese?   Iswtg most of these sentiments come from insecurity. Just be proud of being Nepalese.|||I am from Terai, only those who are from Mithila and Bhojpuri culture share similarity and that too only with the Mithila and other similar cultures of the India, not to the entirety of India.  Plus, why do most Nepalese think that Madhesi are entirely of Terai region?? 🤦🤦|||People often compare castes and culture on internet but the real world is totally different i believe 99% of such posts are meant for mindless timepass.    I noticed something similar where in a post i mentioned Diwali somewhere instead of Tihar and one guy came up saying why did I used the term Diwali and not Tihar. This shows how stupid and sensitive some people with their views for opposite cultures and caste.

I don’t know why even me. I am also trying to figure it out.|||But nepali people make reels with hindi songs|||Dashain = Dusshera (for the most part - origin of the festival is same - how it is celebrated is a bit different)  Tihar = Diwali (same as above)  Social values are similar, no that different. We are all dharmic societies. Families are similar. Food traditions are similar (daal, bhaat, tarkari is common across the subcontinent). Flavors changes but that changes even between families living 2 houses apart. Such is the diversity.  Architecture is similar. Pahadi architecture is shared across India/Nepal, Plain area architecture is also shared across both countries.  Ofcourse we are more influenced to tibetan culture compared to India as a whole. But pahadi states of India are as much influenced by tibetan culture due to close proximity.   In general Nepali are calmer than Indians. But I have found that Pahadi people of India are calmer still and south indians (had lived in Karnataka for education) are also calmer. Only hot heads were in the northern plains of India.  \\*\\*Nepal is different to India only and only due to its Nationalism\\*\\*. Kind of like Germany and Switzerland.  So, let Indians think we are similar because we are. But that does not mean Nepal = India.|||You described Nepal like we were people that have our own unique culture and way of life etc etc  But then tied to to tibetan culture like it was a major contributor  I don't believe that at all, as mentioned above I think we nepali have our own way   Speaking of influence, indian influence is def higher than tibetan culture😂|||anything to justify greater India🙏",

I just need some short-term financial help to restart production.  Could anyone guide me on: 1.\tHow to get a business loan in Nepal as an unregistered business? •\tOr, if registration is required, what are the steps to register and become eligible for a business loan?  2.\tHow to approach small investors or lenders for short-term funding? •\tI’m open to giving better interest rates than banks usually offer.  If anyone here wants to invest or lend, I can share the sales data and performance reports from my website, everything is real and verifiable.  Appreciate any advice or guidance 🙏",

It’s increasing in population but decreasing in quality of life and peace of living.     * People spit gutka and paan everywhere.    * Public and private sector staff often act like they’re doing you a favor instead of just doing their job.    * Basic civic sense is missing.    * Many people talk in a rude way, even though Maithili itself is such a sweet language.    * Hospitality is terrible. Even in well-known restaurants, you don’t get a menu. You have to call staff multiple times, and when they finally come, they’re rude.    * Local leaders and youth behave like they own the place and can do whatever they want.    * Loud music in public transport and public spaces is normal.    * People get aggressive and start fights very quickly.    * If a policeman tries to enforce basic civic sense (like asking not to play loud music), people threaten him — “I’ll burn your police station.” * One time, Janakpur was known for quality education. Now it feels like the complete opposite. And the list goes on. Why don’t the people and leaders of Janakpur want to learn from other places? Why isn’t civic sense a priority for the local government? Why can’t people just be calm and respectful?",

There are two prophecies in the bible.  1. Jesus will return in an event called the Armageddon.  2. There will be a millennia of \"kingdom of heaven on earth\".  But there is disagreement in the order. One believes jesus will return before the millennium are called **pre** millennials, another believes jesus will return after the millennium are called **post** millennials. Both of them want jesus to come back.  To make this happen post millennials work towards the project of this kingdom. Missionary activity is that. They are trying to take over the world, and after a thousand years of that, Jesus will come back. Which is also how Christianity was used to justify imperialism back in the day.  Pre millennials are terrifying. They want to enact this Armageddon. Which is when there is an armed conflict in the valley of Megiddo, in Israel**.** And look at whats happening in that region.  I used to think the hindu idea of every next yug getting worse is bad because it develops an apathy in people. But Christianity is impressive, their prophecies affect real world geopolitics.|||Christian here. I can’t say for all - many believe that sharing good idea with people will be worth. It’s like this is one life - so if the truth of Christianityis right then all people should hear the truth.  Now, i understand some come from weird style and approach. I get the frustuation. But the thing is many want people to know what their belief system is and this is a part of “particing their religious acts” like same as with worshipping in temple - take it as a “to do” for religious duty. Now, there are some sects of hinduism that does this. People of Iscoon - they reinterpret every portion of bhagwat geeta and then mix every religion truth into it. Ask any higher pandit who has good academics in hinduism and see how they cringe on the iscoon and harey krishna movements. My grandfather was a hindu sscholar and knew sanskrit from the bottom from his heart  Be aware of people with korean face who preach christianity- those are funded and have huge cultic around.|||No religion is perfect. Evey religion has bad sides . I dont like christianity but Christ. Read about Christ and His sacrifice and see for yourself if He moves your heart.

I am a business owner i dont depend on anyone’s donation. I believe every soul has empty wound . Being spiritually awakened and renewed mindset through the words of Christ helps me become a better person and better decision making.

It is very clear that it commands Christians to 'share the good news' (Matthew 28:19-20) but the bible is clearly against bribery as written in Exodus 23:8. There is also a popular \"prosperity gospel\" which is a distortion of the bible and has given Christianity a bad reputation.   Onto the 'why, what benefit would the normal christians get from me converting to Christianity': The fundamental reason is that the bible says we all have sinned against God (Romans 3:23), doing the things we knew were evil. Now, compared to Hinduism which has a karma system, Christianity has a justice-grace system that is more tied to how courts work, which requires for punishment of sins/crimes and makes the sacrifice of Jesus necessary.  Thus, those who believe it to be true want to make it known to others for belief that it will save their souls.",

C is good for low level programming, and also one good language where you dont need to scratch your head more. 2. Write code to your maths assignment. Not only math, but other subject like graphics or anything that needs numbers|||I see people recommending beginners start with low level languages. Honestly, that's only realistic if you have insane discipline. Those suggesting it are forgetting what it's like to be a complete beginner, they're just projecting their current knowledge onto you.  In a world full of distraction like now, starting with something boring takes extraordinary discipline and I wouldn't trust myself with that.  Start with high level languages instead, especially something visual like web development. Learn html, css, js,  you'll actually see what you're building, which is much more fun.  Once you've got the basics down, set up a proper dev environment. Your desk, theme, and editor actually matter. There are phases where coding gets boring sometimes and having a setup you love makes it easier to show up. When you need a break, customize your theme or tweak your workspace. Then jump back into coding. Repeat this cycle forever.|||would have done Law instead.|||First year: Take C programming very seriously, learn web basics like html,css,js Second year: Do leetcode exercises while studying DSA so that I actually get what I study, learn FE frameworks basics like React.

If i had too start a tech journey, probably  1. Become good/decent in one language(python/javascript), no c,c++,go,rust 2. learn a backend framework and learn to do basic crud stuff, use database 3. learn frontend and become full stack or  learn linux, web server, basic deployment stuffs and choose the path of cracked backend developer with stacking devops stuffs. 4. Learn cloud, containerization, application monitoring.  Btw, if you are disciplined enough, don't waste 4 yrs of cs,    you can learn the above stuffs in around 1.5-2yrs if you push yourself reguraly,   you probably won't be able to follow through all the stuffs i've mentioned due to time/energy constraint while doing cs stuff. 80-90% cs stuff is absolute bullshit(outdated, non-marketable, non-comprehensible, trivial), you'll regret joining cs after couple of years,   bookmark this comment.|||There is no perfect roadmap  Explore gara.

Then proceed to ML with some Python programming.|||I saw many comments with their take on starting with low level programming, and some argue against it. But I think it really depends on what programming means to you. If you feel cs is just writing code in a company or making aandha paisa, then definitely you should learn those things that will land you a job faster, and a high level is the best way there. But if you are a person who loves to scratch things and is very enthusiastic about this domain, and you like to explore more, then I would suggest going with low level ( i.e., C programming). I also saw someone saying C feels boring, but that's not the case if you are actually interested and want to learn, not for the sake of others or to find a job, but because you want to have strong fundamentals in computer science. I learned C as my first programming language, and I didn't learn it in school; I didn't learn the way that schools teach C. If you learn the way school teaches, then it's definitely boring, and you never get to know how deep yet simple the language is, and how fun it can be. The most interesting and fun days of my programming career were those when I was doing low level programming. I am not saying you can't have fun solving problems in high-level languages, but i feel when you move towards the corporate world or you do something you love as a career/work for others, then I don't think it still sparks in your face. I am not saying you can't enjoy it, many people do actually enjoy it very much, but I find it draining, and THAT'S A PERSONAL VIEW|||First of all, what is your goal? Cs can be broad.   My suggestion is just as I would have done it if I could go back in the past. My main focus would be to clarify my goal and work my way up from there. Since I read your other comments and I am assuming that you want to be a developer and you are completely fresh:  1. My first priority would be to understand the database. This is where it all starts and ends. If you understand the in and out of database you will have an easier time developing a software.  2. I would study every major aspect of OOP + file handling. My go to language would be C/C++. No need to worry about which one to choose. You're less likely to use it in your development career unless you're a software engineer or a game developer.  3. I would learn javascript and css by heart. I would not listen to anyone saying otherwise. This has been a lifesaver for me for more than I can count my fingers in my hands. 4. As soon as I understand OOP, I would jump into studying python  (you can choose your own backend coding).  5. Finally, I would start with my small full stack project. My focus would be on how to connect the database to the business logic. (For example a personal finance tracker, music tracker, all in one basic tool I keep searching for online otherwise etc.) In this process I would study the logic, crud, api (ajax, hook etc), token, session, cookies etc.  6. Create a fine documentation of all the steps I took to create my personal project including mistakes and solutions.  7. A proper manual of my software. (Start now because you will need to be best at it if you want to market your software later in your life.) 8. I would keep in my mind that there are best of the best out there and keep my ego in check. Go back to basics as many times as I require. I wouldn't look down on others or stop learning from them. 7. Last but not the least, I would take care of my health. Especially my brain, back and eyes. If you want to become smart, you need to learn to give yourself a break.   I can't go into more details here but I hope it helps. Happy learning and best of luck!  Edit: git! Forgot to add it. Study from early on.|||Lean AI & ML.

I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.

I even collaborated with an app (though I didn’t get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work.

I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn’t go as expected. None of my 25–30 posts or reels even crossed 100 views, and more than half got copyright claims. It was a bit frustrating, especially since I was used to getting 8–53 million monthly views on Instagram.

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋 — I’ve been building a React-based technical blog hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and ran into a big issue:  Currently its hosted using github pages with a custom domain, if i plan to scale this and add a backend server what advice would you give, i need it for seo and potentially placing ads.  Yes this is ai generated for proper english and summarization.     Google **discovered** my pages but **wouldn’t index** them. After some digging, here’s what I found and how I fixed it.    # 💥 The Problems  1. **404s on deep links** – `/blog/post` returns 404 because GitHub Pages only serves static files. 2. **Empty HTML for crawlers** – SPA loads `<div id=\"root\"></div>` first, no content. 3. **Bad meta tags** – my build still used `localhost` URLs.  # 🧩 My Solution  Couldn’t use `react-snap` (React 19 issues), so I wrote a custom pre-rendering pipeline.  **Stack:** React 19 + Vite 7 + Puppeteer 24 + GitHub Pages  **Key steps**  * **404.html redirect hack:** custom file that redirects `/blog/post` → `/?redirect=/blog/post`, React then restores the route with `history.replaceState`. * **Puppeteer pre-rendering:** after build, launches a headless browser, visits each route, waits for render, saves full HTML to `dist/blog/{slug}/index.html`. * **Auto sitemap:** built from my blog data array.  **Build pipeline:**      npm run deploy     → vite build     → puppeteer pre-render (13 routes ≈30 s)     → generate sitemap     → gh-pages -d dist       # ✅ Results  * Every page now has full HTML before hydration * Google shows “Page can be indexed” * Deep links work (no 404s) * Correct canonical + OG tags * 13 routes built in \\~30 s  # 🔍 What I’m Asking  1. **Scaling:** Pre-render is sequential (2–3 s / route). Ideas for parallel or incremental builds? 2. **Content storage:** Posts currently in one JS array — split JSON per post or use a CMS? 3. **Approach:** Is Puppeteer pre-rendering worth it vs moving to Next.js / Remix? 4. **SEO:** What else should I add beyond sitemap + OG + canonical + JSON-LD?",

Like WOW. False hopes? How can Israel be blamed for giving “false hope” when they didn’t even know the hostages were alive or dead. They simply just speculated and hoped all of them were still. How can Israel give you a concrete report unless Hamas release them officially, which they did now.|||Nepal’s soul is crushed. Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel’s crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining “context” over our dead. Nepal, rise, reject this death cult, or lose more Bipins. #NepalStands #HateKills #GenZFails|||Awful news. Even until the last minute, sources were saying he was alive.

Look at the UK: Muslim grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale, and more raped thousands of girls, 1,400 in Rotherham alone, protected for years because officials feared “racism” accusations. Muslims defend it saying, “That’s not Islam, just radicals!” But dodging the problem is the problem. Ignoring the pattern, jihad, Sharia demands, 2.9 kids per Muslim woman vs. 1.6 for natives, lets this fester.  The “Free Palestine” posers? Silent on Bangladesh Hindus raped and displaced, Boko Haram’s 35,000+ murdered Nigerian Christians, or Yazidis and Kurds erased by ISIS. Middle Eastern Christians? Down 90% from bombings and beheadings. No hashtags for them or Bipin, just trendy anti-Israel chants. Islam’s radicals push “final truth” and jihad, yet apologists pretend it’s all a misunderstanding. That denial got Bipin killed, lets grooming gangs thrive, and leaves our temples trashed. Nepal deserves better.

I don’t know the exact philosophy of the religion or the teachings of the Quran, but based on what I see in many Islamic countries and among some Muslim communities, Islam is the most violent and intolerant religion in the world. Muslims struggle to coexist peacefully with other religions and never accept religious diversity (The same case with the Nepali Converted Chsitian, they cannot accept the Hindus and Hindus festival whereas those Foreigner who have been practicing Christianity since Century do no have any Obligation to celebrate and take part in different festival and celebration of different religion)**  In many non-Muslim majority countries, Islam is allowed to grow and Muslims are free to practice their religion. But in many Islamic-majority countries, the population of other religions often declines over time, sometimes due to violence, forced conversions, or systemic discrimination. For example, just look at the religious demographics of Pakistan 40–50 years ago compared to today.  In Europe and North America, Muslims frequently protest and express their views against the Ruling people and religion too, often quite aggressively. But can you imagine Hindus, Christians, or Buddhists openly protesting against Islamic leaders or Islamic policies in Islamic countries? It would likely result in severe consequences or violence.  In Nepal too, while Muslims may seem peaceful now, it’s worth noting that the long-settled Muslim communities (who have been here since the time of Prithvi Narayan Shah, when they were brought in for weapon-making and other skilled work) have generally coexisted peacefully. However, the more recent or growing Muslim population seems peaceful possibly only because they are still a very small minority.  Lets jus see if their population ever reaches 10–15%, there could be a rise in communal tensions or violence.  **This is not a hate-filled statement, just an observation based on patterns seen in various parts of the world. I am expressing what I see and fear, based on history and current events.**|||Finally someone makes sense.  RESITANCE DOESN'T MEAN KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE. Islamists will only play the victim card in a place where they are in the minority.

That doesn't surprise me at all though especially because of the covert (and sometimes even overt) backing - financially, logistically, militarily, intelligence, etc. - those terrorist groups receive from some nations - especially (but certainly not limited to) the US and Israel.  In short, the lack of coverage isn’t just neglect, it’s structural. It reflects editorial priorities shaped by political alliances, audience demand, and the need to protect state narratives.|||Well, I am a straight right leaning Christian. What Isreal's government has been doing to Palestinians since 2020, is objectively a genocide, and we Americans are tired of funding their war efforts, heck we don't feed the impoverished and homeless here in the states, but we can fund a stupid war? Both sides are wrong, Hamas and Isreal's government. Both should be brought to justice, and both need to give us our damn money back.   Listen up, over 50k innocent Palestanians have died, mainly women and children, they didn't deserve that. The people on Oct 7 didn't deserve that either. Screw Hamas, and screw Netanyanhu. Put these monsters in jail where they belong and remove Isreal's entire government and arrest the IDF bombers as well. By force, if necessary. America before the 60s wouldn't have funded this crap, neither any European entity/country.  Yes there are other genocides, yes Christians are being genocided in The Middle East/Africa, yes there's radical Islamists, yes there are rising crime rates in the UK ETC. This should all be addressed, and CAN all be addressed. Empathy doesn't have a limit and its not situational, or else its not empathy. None of that excuses what Isreal's government body has done!! What would Jesus do? Only pick one side or another? We have to universally be against all evil and murder, which The Bible demands us to do!|||the logic that tyo middle east ko problem ham@s le garda matra vayeko ra nepalko problem raja le garda matra vayeko vanne chai misleading, incomplete, biased, ignorant ho. dherai lekhina afai research + study garera bujha.|||Do you have any credible sources confirming that Bipin Joshi was killed by Hamas?

And wanting to be with someone younger is predatory behaviour regardless of gender. 6 setting boundaries entails telling 6 to wear, who to talk to etc etc, which is controlling behaviour. I feel like both women and men are shamed for not wanting to date financially instable people. There is an added layer of prejudice with respect to single mothers since they are considered used goods, left behind while no one questions the men who left their own children behind with supposedly bad women. Actively seeking out submissive women is also very weird because it generally indicates that they are looking for someone with no opinions of their own.|||Men want older women = preference   Women want younger men = Cougar/ Predator   Men don’t date women they find ugly = preference  Women don’t date broke men = Gold digger   Men does no household work = Normal  Women thinks men should help sometimes = pseudo feminist   Men stays with their own parents after marriage = Normal   Women wants to stay just couple so that they don’t have to serve their inlaws everyday for 40+ years = All hell break loose|||These examples are overly skewed to fit your narrative, you are not comparing like with like.

Just don't do illegal and predatory shit.|||Noone calls men predator if they want younger women. Specially Nepal ma ta 90%+ bihe sabai younger keti haru sanga.

Women dating significantly older men is called being groomed. Noone is going to call you immature for not wanting to date single mothers, timi nepali so its unlikely ull be in that situation anyway.

Nobody gives a fuck about what you think about a single mother irl? What's all the fuss in internet? This isn't even a real issue in our society.  Women wanting dominant is ipso facto them being submissive. wtf are you on about? there degree's to it. Whether you want a concubine or a wife. Guess which one seems off?  Men don't have boundaries, y'all are desperate mindless standardless fuckers. I am sure majority of men would pursue just anything that's XX and whine about it later if things get south. And there are degrees to it, are you limiting your partner's ability to think independently? It's wrong in either case.  Some Double standard exists, will continue to exist and it's not a big deal.

Survive or get lost.|||![gif](giphy|l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS)|||I think a lot of this is accurate to a degree depending on the circumstances of each situation.   For example, men can absolutely have boundaries but some men are absolutely controlling about what their women wear, hang out with, do etc.  Am I saying all men? Absolutely not.  Am I saying women can't be controlling or crazy? Absolutely not.   Bottom line, both men and women are capable of being manipulative, predatory, and crazy.   So while I agree with some of this, I will say it has very little context in each situation as all situations are different.|||no because when women say “we want older men” they mean 3-8 years older, as men tend to be immature. Men say things like “after 25 women lose value.”   women don’t date broke men because they have kids, can’t work and need someone to support them. You need money to live. Men don’t date single mothers because they don’t want to raise someone else’s child. This is a stupid comparison anyway, because you can earn money but cant get rid of your kids + women date ‘single fathers’ all the time.   Women want dominant as in ‘someone who can look after me’. Men want submissive as in ‘someone who does everything for me’|||Wanting someone younger is okey unless you are going for minor either you are a guy or a lady. Nepal ma heri ta men(older) woman(young) is normalized, astinai ko le ho yei sub ma rakheko thiyo about one of her 18yo cousin getting married to divorced uncle in his 40s with 1 son.

Men already have a lot of advantages in this patriarchal world and statistics show how men have used this advantage for crimes. This is why women having to set boundary is for their own protection and all the standards women have set is for basic safety and a good life .|||Society has always been judgemental!

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "No. The reforestation campaign in Nepal has been really exemplary. The concept of Community Forests has been modal and it has had a massive impact on the  green coverage. The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

And yet the old generation say that ‘sabai forest fadisakyo’ or say ‘paila kati hariyali thiyo’. However I’d say it needs more effort and forest fire is a serious issue.|||Here's an in-depth international piece on it from NZ's Māori television:   https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/04/22/re-greening-a-country-the-story-of-nepals-community-forests/|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||Kehi Haina aajkal maanxe haru hills xodera flat Tira migration vaye, gas maa reliant vaye , Gai goru, bhaisi paalna xode.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming “pay after getting the product in your own email”).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > “Scam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.”   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine — said “no need to pay before getting access,” and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies — nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he’s “sorting it out for all clients ,” but after that — no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.  I’ve attached screenshots below — just sharing this as a lesson for everyone. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.  Stay safe guys 🙏",

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I’m not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US. Cold emails and reach would be the way to go 4. Research countries where Big Tech will sponsor software engineers and bring them there. There’s big tech hubs in Poland, Amsterdam, Singapore and more. Research if the tech companies there also sponsor talent from abroad.|||I know a bunch who came directly from Nepal. The companies in EU don't differentiate based on where you're from.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It’s really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well?

These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023.

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

My first-term exam went unexpectedly bad no matter how much I studied, the questions turned out very difficult. I feel extremely demotivated and depressed right now. I used to be one of the best students until grade 10, but after entering +2, the syllabus feels vast, and my study approach doesn’t seem to be working anymore. Now I don’t know what to do. Should I join tuition classes or not? I’m seeking advice from seniors and experienced people. My college runs from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.The problem is how to manage everything together studies, my interest in webdev, and personal time. On top of that, my first-term result has put me under a lot of stress. I keep wondering can I really make a comeback from here?",

I can understand you and what I'd suggest you is to focus on the class properly sit on the first bench, listen to the teacher and mark important things that the teacher says. Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts. Understand the concept and youtube ma gayera search important topics and questions from that chapter ani practice questions regularly. Ani sabai subject thorai thorai everyday study gara.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.

Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest.

The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.

I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I’m very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It’s up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I’d also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don’t like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I’m going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we’ve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don’t reckon like that at all. From my point of view – and from any fair-dinkum Aussie – you’re more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.

They’re asking for any proof people might have videos, photos, eyewitness accounts, documents, or other evidence related to excessive force, abuse, or violations during the protests.  📩 How to share evidence:  * Email directly to [investigation@nhrcnepal.org](mailto:investigation@nhrcnepal.org) * Or submit physically at any NHRC office (central, provincial, or branch — full list in notice). * Whatsapp - Dr. Tikaram Pokharel (Spokesperson): 9851053127, Shyam Babu Kafle (Asst. Spokesperson): 9851199095, Prakash Bhatta: 9849733001  I’d also like to add that the InDepthStory team to my knowledge has collected a huge amount of material from the protests. If they could share their evidence with NHRC, it would massively strengthen the investigation. Let's DM them or email them directly to encourage them to contribute to this cause.  Let's make a meaningful contribution as an internet community and help bring the victims justice.  Source: [Home | NHRC NEPAL](https://www.nhrcnepal.org/)",

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don’t look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are. Nepal's population comes from the region similar to them. I have no clue why peru has low population, maybe there isn't most habitable land. Like how russia is so massive but its population is low |||If you know Peru, it's almost all mountainous terrain like a huge chunk of it is the Andes, and another chunk of it is the Amazon, with the rest being deserts where most people live.  Absolute extremes. The terrain absolutely messes things up.  Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ²|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Since Class 12, I’ve been financially independent. I invested in NEPSE, paid for my own bachelor’s admission, and worked full-time (40 hrs/week) while balancing a day college schedule. It was tough, but manageable. Whenever I felt burned out, I’d take a break and go trekking or visit lakes with friends.

The culture and people are nice but you will always be pigeonholed here. Experiencing new culture, being self independent and the journey could be rewarding.   However, it all depends on your financial background, your skillset and courage to step into the world that is full of surprises. Not easy but you never know.|||Many people go to different parts of the world because they want to explore other countries and wish to be independent from their family and societal norms.

My parents left Nepal when I was too young to make a decision, and I followed them. But the feeling of being back home is unmatched. I have been to many countries throughout the years, made many successes in my career, but nothing matches the feeling of walking in Boudha in the evening...or racing to see a sunset on Poon Hill.   Congratulations on your successes. I hope your life continues to be very rich in experiences and opportunity.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you’re trying to position yourself as “smarter” or “better” than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That’s impressive, but it’s also a privilege many don’t have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn’t about “hype” but it’s about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn’t be possible back home.  So yes, it’s great that you’re making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22.

I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content.

Bidesh is worth your skill and knowledge so absolutely  unique experience for everyone.|||I didn't have a choice but to stay in Nepal. My family wasn't in the financial position to send me abroad. I didn't ponder in remorse, but told myself- if I have to stay here, let's try. I had a good career, I was happy even though I didn't get paid a lot of pay. I managed my finances, got two degrees, and lived a modest life. I climbed the ladder swiftly, but then hit a peak.   I anticipated rapid economic regression in Nepal, so I decided to leave the country. I am pursuing my third degree, in a subject that I absolutely love in the US. It's barely been a year, and I have seen such a pivotal shift in my perspective, and I always ask myself, \"What if I had been able to expose myself to this standard of education and community?\"    Nepal is great, if you want an easy-paced life but there's so much more out here, a lot more. I am happy I left, and I wish I did it sooner.|||Honestly don't let peer pressure get to you if you find it comfortable where you are then stay or if there's a place you desire to be then go when you can. No matter what money will always be an issue wherever you are. I'm American and my boyfriend is Nepalese were living in the US and yes we have to work a lot of hours especially planning on buying a house soon hopefully. What company do you work for if you don't mind sharing? My boyfriend is trying to get a webdev or any remote job since his current job is an hour away|||You do you.|||If people thinking going abroad means just flipping burgers then yea very narrow minded ho. Doctors, Engineers, Tech, Accountants, Business-people unlimited potential all kinds of people are abroad from nepali heritage.|||Now let me know, how much is your parent’s income?|||If one goes for higher studies abroad for an undergraduate degree, with no certifiable skills whatsoever, they end up with employed in unskilled minimum wage jobs. With sky-high tuition in all Anglophone countries, they have to work 2 or 3 such jobs. No wonder they're struggling. However, that struggle has an expiration date for genuine students and eventually they'll end up with a higher quality education and a relevant high-paying job.|||for some people going abroad is about independence, freedom from stereotypical society and parents. atleast for me, it is. i am still here but planning to move abroad as soon as i can. but stable career ko sath ma, so ACCA padhxu yetai basera ani janxu abroad, is this idea okay? or will i still struggle financially? give your advice to this brother of yours.|||  I’d say you were fortunate. In Nepal, survival and a better future are manageable if your family is financially stable and owns a house in Kathmandu. Living here then allows you to pursue anything. But for those from outside the valley without a steady family income, it becomes very difficult. Whether by choice or necessity, many have to go abroad to earn, not just to follow a trend but for survival and a better future.|||Unrelated but I'm proud of you OP. I wish I'd started working sooner just to actually feel what it's like in the shoes of someone who works and earns for themselves.|||Kun field ho ni? IT ho?|||You have been financially independent since 12, but not all can secure a job after grade 12 and might not have interest in Sharemarket or may not understand how it works, or might not have enough money to start with it. Also, moving abroad is more about emotional independence also.( Like even for me I might earn good amount in Nepal, can pay my own college fee, but somewhere down the line, I am still dependent on my family for a lot of things, not because I want to, tara sano sano kurama my family will help me out with) tara once I go abroad, I am on my own, no matter what. So that make you selfdependent and start ma garo vayeni after a certain year, it will be new normal.|||\\>> how do you feel about your decision now? Is going abroad worth all the hype?   I left Nepal when I was way past my teenage years. Even though I am not as happy or rather don't have peaceful mind as I would hope for, my decision to leave Nepal was a good call! I should have left Nepal a few years before I eventually did.   Going abroad is definitely good and I suggest everyone to do so once in their life time; however, how long to stay is up for debate. I would rather emphasize on THE purpose. I left Nepal because I couldn't stand to live in Nepal. I am poorer than the most of my old friends who stayed in Nepal. Spiritually and mentally, I am as fucked up as before, which was something I thought I would get over by moving abroad.       However, I have a hope and \"I can do\" mentality. I HIGHLY appreciate the way I think these days mixed with whatever I had learned back in Nepal and the new things in this new environment. I wouldn't give this away for any price! (well a few million dollars might do the trick :D )      Thing is, we tend to have this bias that the things that are familiar to us and we identify with always seem better and superior to others. One should come out of it to see how things actually are. Hence, staying abroad is a must! It provides options and more importantly new perspectives on everything!|||Lol you had a choice. Most people dont.|||this guy is FAKE !!!!|||[removed]|||Oh my god, so much hate here. “ not everyone is like you “ , “ you are lucky “  What a bunch of bullshit. I am happy for you and i have a lot of friends in nepal earning as much as me ( i am in Australia rn ). You are doing great   Meanwhile i have hardly any savings. Life abroad is tough, the standard of living in western countries ( Australia included ) is on a decline. If you already have a house in Nepal, you are better off back home.  If i could work in nepal and earn half of what i earn now, my life will still be more luxurious in Nepal.   The only challenge is, one has to be highly skilled. I don’t think i am skilled enough to secure the same kinda role back home but when i am , i will definitely return.  Most Nepalese here do degrading stuff for work. 🤢🤮. The only reason people want to go abroad is that they are not skilled enough and are willing to do anything for money.   Nepal doesn’t have a problem with brain drain, cus people with brains are not the ones going abroad to clean toilets, cus they don’t have to.  The smart ones are able to survive in Nepal.  I am lucky that i come from a well off family and didn’t have do low level work for money, but i am  as dumb as them for sure. I just got lucky  People should be inspired from you, instead of getting trapped in a hopeless lifestyle abroad.",

To say RSP karyakarta are no different.... This is very true, but why do you expect it to be otherwise? That's HOW our nepalese civitlity is rooted in, and you can't expect the RSP kartakarta to be entirely different.  This is a problem not just with RSP/Ravi but with everybody else-- Balen, Harka..etc, Even current GenG,  hell even with Rastriye Bibeksheel party supporters... Such changes takes ages and generations. Look at the current US, Europe and other top civilized countries...they are no different either.   While they all are no different, at least the karyakarta of these 'NEW' forces had the audacity of breaking out of the chains of Major political parties and confront them, which was almost IMPOSSIBLE before the era of Ujjwal Thapa/Balen.   2. This current narrative of 'NO DIFFERENT' is the most   dangerous campaign against all the NEW FORCES.  Its the first step by the 3 BIG POLITICAL Parties), and soon will turn into we are better than all others.  Back to the Cycle!   3. Sumana quitting is a big loss to RSP and could be a loss or gain for herself, which only time will tell.  BUT it's a massive loss for us, for sure. It's all according to the Divide and Rule by the major political parties. Unless she is joined by Balen, etc, and turn into another or even bigger alternative force that the RSP itself. Even then, you will still see the new karyakartas no different.|||Nepali haru nai testo ho. Bholi Balen le party kholnu parcha, tyo party ni Balen kai face dekhayera vote khane chalaune ho.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate.

But   the thing is older gen didn't account that the interim leader would be choosen within 2 day and in discord.  That was their blind spot.    That was uncalculated,  from what i know many things went south, in many places the people involved vandalism where not many local.   its an open secret that protest was overtaken by many parties.    we can't know everything but the best option we have is we are not a member of any party, we are un-predicatble cause we also don't know many things. this is double edge soward we can also be manipulated, this miraj vs sudhan blaen vs harka   and the ekanitpur shit.   so, my suggestion listen to old folks they definitely are all vedas, they know someone and that someone might just have many sources.   i am not asking to be a spy and report,  but its better to learn many things but also don't believe everything.   And i can't share many things i learned as it account as Rumour and flase narrative and can be dangerous but i think someone behind seen things might be going on,  best source of information look for people whose gob is to protect all, you know.   i don't want to leave this country, Adding loan to family with their own debt while others country are hating on foreign students now and how i might not able to meet them in next or another dashin or for years, if i did go out thinking about this all, i don't wish for money this dashin but hope till i graduate form college, i am not forced by the conditions to go out to in name of study and work.|||I think for a fair election, the Nepalese government must ban 500 and 1000 notes.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

            "body": "I recently completed my bachelor’s in CS and spent about two years working full-time as a developer. Right after my final semester exams, I lost my job and haven’t been able to land another job or freelance project since.  For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this “retirement dream” of buying farmland and settling down someday. Now, after not writing a single line of code for over two months and spending most of my days watching YouTube farm tours, learning about crops, livestock, and regenerative agriculture, I’m wondering if this is just burnout talking or a genuine calling.  Has anyone here actually made the leap from tech to farming (or any completely different field)? What was it like financially and mentally? Any lessons or regrets you’d share?  I’m trying to figure out whether I should push harder to stay in tech for a while or lean into this urge and start small with agriculture. Would really appreciate honest stories, advice, or even reality checks",

I'm always thinking of quitting and start farming cash crops, unseasonal crops and some mixed fruit garden. I'm in IoT and embedded so always daydreaming of having a small farm producing high value products like saffron in a climate controlled environment.|||I am a second generation industrialist in poultry working in agritech intergration, very rewarding if you understand the loopholes of market. The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge. I am engaged in poultry currently and my company does have cold chain system so I know how it works (specifically for chicken) and the model is very rewarding.|||I feel your pain of not being able to find a job right now. Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails. Or shadow someone in the business closely first.  Also if you really want to leave tech then you can choose any field I am assuming youre still young - be it farming or some other thing. If you feel you dont have enough experience to pull yourself a job at this point or just the market is saturated, try specializing in something in tech? like AI/ML? Data? then apply for jobs. It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.  Or you could do 50/50 and spend some time researching on the farming business and also upskilling in tech.

            "body": "Hey guys, just wanted to share this so nobody else falls for the same trap I did.  So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming “pay after getting the product in your own email”).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > “Scam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.”   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine — said “no need to pay before getting access,” and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies — nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he’s “sorting it out for all clients ,” but after that — no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.  I’ve attached screenshots below — just sharing this as a lesson for everyone. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.  Stay safe guys 🙏",

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I’m not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It’s really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well?

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

Aru bank ko ma dekhayena, nic ma dekhayo|||No worries, I’ve already tested this, nothing is sent to the backend. It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it’s not. They likely initialize and tear down the camera process in the background to speed up access.|||SBL does that too|||Samsung OneUI 7.0 ma ni xina hai yo problem, maybe device specific ho ki.|||They keep logs for the fraud detection, yes almost all the banking systems keep the camera logs while logging in to the account.|||aru ma no yasto hunxa camera ko permission on bhayara ho|||Same thing used to happen in kumari and prime bank mobile app, I noticed as I used to turn off camera from the software so any app that needs camera would ask first, but for some reason as soon as I logged in those 2 apps asked to open camera and mic settings, but as of recently it seems to be fixed|||Your account might be hacked!!many of peoples' don't know shit..which is why iphone is too good for protection of ur account..if yu using Android then for sure you are on watch..

Aafno aafno opinion lai fact jasari prove garna nakhojam.   Questioning the tradition is valid and should be done. That’s how we will get more information on the practice and then we can determine whether the tradition is actually jeopardising the child’s mental health or not.   But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. 😂|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don’t oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through 🩸. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you’ve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you’ll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  · A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. · The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). · For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  · The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. · Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  · Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. · Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. · Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. · Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn’t everyone forced and fed their parent’s beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari’s time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari’s are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

You’ve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families. Where do you think that is abusive? You are living in a bubble. It is a different culture and a tradition it doesnt mean that it is abusive. Kumaris have had a long history, have you ever heard one of them come out and say that it was traumatic? Stop your virtue signaling.|||I would like to hear it from past Kumaris, if they dont have a problem, who are we to stop this 1000 yr old practice|||As always kumari tradition is called as a child abusive and inhuman act again. Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended. So please watch podcasts of ex kumaris. Btw I'm not Newar. I'm not from valley either.

To those insisting Kumaris are always “grateful” or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We’ve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it’s what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it’s not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she’s missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let’s be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there’s more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we’re talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around “bahun,” “Christian,” or “other cultures” like that somehow answers the question.

And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

Over last few days, I read some articles, listened to podcasts and was surprised to learn that Kumaris until 2000 A.D. were not given any education. That must have set those girls back and must have struggled to transition. A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.  This little kid is Royal Kumari now and will be raised by care takers and I guess her parents can visit her once a week. Atleast Kumaris of other places have option to live in their own houses. Her opportunity to grow as a normal kid is taken for her.|||Usle ghumna milxa? If she wants to go to let's say , manag Mustang? Or ilam? Ani cafe garu jana milxa?

Ofc social gatherings in the name of tradition and culture are the pillers that bind a community/society together, yet there should not be a pain in anyone involved!  Let's raise our voice against: 🔊🔊🔊📢📢📢  1. Perception of Menstruation/Period (from east to west Nepal, including chhaupadi)  2. Kumari tradition  3. Slaughter in the name of \"deuta/kul puja\"   4. Restrictions on women (many young men don't allow their wives to work outside, this still exists!) (need to rise above manly ego, and bring equality and sort of freedom)  5. Character shaming of women (many young people are involved in disrespecting and character shaming women in social media -- it's mostly targeted to women) (objectifying a human)  6. among many others ........🚨🚨🚨   (protecting our culture traditions and values is a must but not at the cost of someone's freedom or pain or human rights)|||https://youtu.be/iT1D1WVQjMU   please watch this video and decide for yourself.|||Also this https://youtu.be/zOYgX5csQ4k|||Are you paid by india to force out nepali culture to replace with theirs,  are you the same person who will celebrate Halloween, new year and Christmas|||Bro, w/o the permission of the family, yettikai kasailai kumari ta banaudainan hola ni?

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let’s be real: he’s the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus — with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what “stable democracy” exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India’s backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra’s Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let’s talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we’d have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage — Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about “democracy dying in 1960.” These same historians never admit that the so-called “democrats” of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It’s easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here’s the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king — a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don’t lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It’s less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs’ heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It’s easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra’s reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here’s why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal’s first elected government (1959–1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn’t long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala’s government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king’s absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal’s sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren’t “ready” for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king’s will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   📌 Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There’s no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let’s not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don’t fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

This also coincidentally occurred around the time F1 decided to move its office to Pulchowk, adjacent to M&S Tower, which is basically Sirohiya's Den. It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control. Let's ask ourselves, who benefits the most from this control? Who was suffering from not having control?   Media? Politicians? Oligarchs?   To everyone wondering about the extent of the control. Never forget how soon videos started to vanish from TikTok during and after the protest.   This is what this entire fiasco was all about.

Imagine them having total control of social media going into 2084?   Even though we've ridiculed them for being 8th standard, they had an ambition- that is total control under the cloak of democracy.

It’s the people who build the infrastructure around themselves. That’s why Harka Sampang is a revolution because his shramdaan simply means, “get up your ass and do something instead of complaining”.  Think about it. Humans were once living in jungle, then they eventually turned it into a village and a city. It’s not one person who did it. Maybe the reason we are underdeveloped is because we are lazy and expect someone else to come and make our lives better.   So we first idolize a person with new ideas, and then demonize the same person.|||Bruv where in dharan you from? I am from dharan as well. Fuckers just creating hate.

And, not all the projects are carried out using shramdan, projects that require technical expertise are obviously given to companies.

He is not a conventional leader with sweet tounge . Dude is cocky as hell and always spits harsh words. But nobody even his haters can deny his love for the nation. Even I don't like him and criticize him all the time because of how critical and straight forward he keeps himself all the time. It's idiotic. But the criticism is more of a constructive one to keep him in check. But these jholeys with all sorts of anonymous names claiming to be dharanis have similar patterns.

Honestly, I don't care who is in the right or wrong; the only thing I wish is that Hamas pays for killing Nepali brothers and Sisters.|||हार्दिक श्रद्धाञ्जली वीर सपुत…  विपिनले कोठामा छिरेको ग्रिनेड बाहिर फ्याँकेको भनेर उनका साथीहरूले भनेको थियो।|||It has not been officially confirmed whether Bipin Joshi is alive or dead. The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel? I hope the war is not over. Hamas needs to be brought into their knees. This cease fire is a win for then.|||https://preview.redd.it/ceus40waktuf1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a16b17c85993ea6e147deac0acc96858a1434e  from [https://www.setopati.com/politics/371509](https://www.setopati.com/politics/371509)|||Is the news of his death confirmed?

We failed him, and he was murdered because of it. Why did he have to move to Israel? Staying in Nepal would have made it nearly impossible for him to support his family.  Rest in peace, Bipin Joshi. Our eternal martyr.|||And nepalis will still defend Palestine|||may god give strength to his family and may he rest in peace 💔|||Damn people here supporting those hamas terrorist driving me crazy    It was palestinian people who voted hamas so they could commit genocide in israel thats why they killed bipin irrespective of his background they only care for their muslims   They could have elected others but no Just like nepalese elects the corrupted leaders every time and then blames leaders  Its the people elected people are nothing but representation of the mass corrupted people elects corrupted leaders Terrorist elects terrorist|||Nepal’s soul is crushed. Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel’s crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining “context” over our dead. Nepal, rise, reject this death cult, or lose more Bipins. #NepalStands #HateKills #GenZFails|||also euta kura sachhauna mann lagyo yo Rest in peace vanne sabda christain haru ko ho , they do not believe in re-incarnation so they say that rest in peace so that they won’t come back but hamro hindu sanskar ma we believe in next janma and we say “ Hardik shradhhanjali “|||[deleted]|||Bro what|||We had hope.

Topper hoina one semester ko project ma aru ko kaam present garera winner bhaeko ho. Always knew she is faking being an intellectual but this is diabolical. Everyone needs to watch this!

Who made you the pioneer or the calculator of Nepal’s culture deciding what is and what isn’t? By that logic, we should throw away all mobile phones and stop using the internet because we didn’t create them ourselves, they’re imports so are they not our culture? Should we just wear old traditional clothes, grow rice, eat, and live “peacefully” in the name of culture like old time?  Why can’t you all just let individuals be happy if they’re not hurting anyone?

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‘real’ identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba. That selective outrage is nothing but hypocrisy.|||I don’t think it’s a problem at all. You need to be inclusive to all religions and culture.

Don’t get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that’s why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one’s own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today’s world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. 😭😭2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye 😭|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

It is about the Everest within us all — the weight of doubt, fear, and resistance.He shows us that true sight does not come from the eyes, but from clarity of purpose and unwavering determination.",

Most Nepalis obtain citizenship at 16 while others obtain citizenship later. Why can't the freaking Election Commission (EC) get the data from that source? Some mechanism to incorporate those that were missed out might still be needed, but it would drastically reduce the work for the EC.",

Gang fight leading to some serious consequence. They'll be spending crazy amount of parent money on cafes and dates and shit. Girls also be flocking towards the jhyaple bad boy type. Both sides will have attachment-less fun for some months and proceed to the next like no big deal.  My own classmates used to change bf like changing clothes. One was stupid enough to send her bf n-des and the whole school got hold of it, just imagine the trauma it will give her in future. Everyone doing whatever the fk it is in the same of true love which changes every few month.      Being a serious guy with some goals in mind used to be the black sheep, still is in colleges. I used to get kinda bullied and the odd one just cuz I didn't have a chick and I didn't goto the cafes and inhale some expensive flavoured shit lmao. (not the reason im attacking this topic tho).

Let’s ignore Computer, Nepali, and English for now .The main challenge for me is Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. My first-term exam went unexpectedly bad no matter how much I studied, the questions turned out very difficult. I feel extremely demotivated and depressed right now. I used to be one of the best students until grade 10, but after entering +2, the syllabus feels vast, and my study approach doesn’t seem to be working anymore. Now I don’t know what to do. Should I join tuition classes or not? I’m seeking advice from seniors and experienced people. My college runs from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.The problem is how to manage everything together studies, my interest in webdev, and personal time. On top of that, my first-term result has put me under a lot of stress. I keep wondering can I really make a comeback from here?",

I can understand you and what I'd suggest you is to focus on the class properly sit on the first bench, listen to the teacher and mark important things that the teacher says. Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts. Understand the concept and youtube ma gayera search important topics and questions from that chapter ani practice questions regularly. Ani sabai subject thorai thorai everyday study gara. And before exam, dont panic and give your best.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",
