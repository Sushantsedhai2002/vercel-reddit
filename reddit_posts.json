And, me thinking to return nepal with not enough savings feels like im letting go of a chance of making my family happy and helping financially.  i’m also no too sure about what im gonna do after i return, but im thinking of doing something of my own.",

The problem is — competition has increased a lot, everyone is selling the same thing, and the profit margin keeps getting smaller every year.  We’ve never really marketed online or built a brand, and now I want to scale it up and bring it online (Facebook/Instagram/TikTok). But I’m not sure how to stand out when so many people are already selling flags at low prices.  If anyone has experience in small manufacturing, online sales in Nepal, or scaling a traditional family business —   **What would you suggest I do to grow this business?**   • How do I build a brand in such a competitive, low-margin product?   • What products should I add to increase profit?   • Any tips for marketing or reaching B2B clients?   • Should I focus on customization or bulk orders?  Any kind of advice would really help. Thanks! 🙏",

            "body": "Applied at Radhe Radhe Yatayat (https://maps.app.goo.gl/oT7TFKJxKghyYrDb9) 1. Apply online form. Search for \"DoTM online form\". A mobile number needs to be used to get the OTP. The OTP will be used for future logins too. DO NOT fill the citizenship number in Nepali.  2. Download the applied form from the portal and take orginal citizenship, it's copy and any test report of blood group from a clinic or hospital. However if your are 100% sure about the blood group you can make a \"blood group card\" outside of the office too. Lots of stationeries have it. Also don't forget to stick a 10 rupees stamp on the form; also available at the stationeries. 3. Then with the documents visit the selected DoTm office ( to be selected in online form with the preferred visit date too). The the journey of queues starts 🙂. The office opens at 10 am so better to go early as there is going to be hell lot of queue. 4. First at the DoTM office, biometric is completed (room no.3) [photo, fingerprints and signature]. Then Rs 55 is to be paid (take change money) for eye checkup (room no. 4). For the eye checkup, direction of \"E\", pointed by a person on the chart kept roughly about 2-3 far will be asked by closing either eyes. Then for colorblindness test, a book containing numbers blended with background is asked. 5. After that fee of Rs 500 is paid(at room 5) to get the admit card and recipet of the payment. This took a lot of time. They print the card and recipet in bulk and supply outside for distribution. Then  the work for the day is done. It took me nearly 3 hours to complete all this ( reached the office at 10:30 am). Also don't forget to take the photo of notice that will be posted for the day at the office. 6. Then the shortlist of the candidates to attend the written test will be published. Now a days, official Facebook pages of various DoTM publishes them. Note the S.No.of your application that will be asked during the verification before exam( For radhe radhe DoTM, the written test was carried out at Budhathoki Driving school, https://maps.app.goo.gl/oQCbDisjNyYoTBh48). Take the admit card and orginal citizenship for the test. There is a app named \"Likhit\" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pandabytes.likhit) great app for preparation. Great app and don't be overconfident and go unprepared. READ as it will be really helpful. In a 30 min exam, completed the MCQs within 10 mins and left the exam hall all due to good preparation. Way lots of people fail written and you have to wait 90 days to reapply so do prepare. After exam do take the photo of notice posted there too. 7. Then at around 1-2 pm of the same day the results of the written test will be published at Facebook or the respective DoTM website along with the trial examination dates.  8. Take the same admit card and orginal citizenship for the trial. 9. If you are planning to reach early for the trial and are going alone its no use. Do take someone to stay at the queue because they paste the name of the candidates to appear for the trial for the day at around 11:10-11:30 and if you are alone, you have to leave the queue and check the new Serial number for the trial ( different from the written test). There will be lots of name to check so the list is arranged in ascending order of the \"application id\" for easy filtering and sorting. Honestly this could have been posted in Facebook or website too, people needn't have to push here and there to read the list. 🙄 10. Now comes the wait; if you have taken someone and you are early great you don't have to wait so much. Otherwise, I waited nearly 3 hours for the trial as only 5 bikes were available and there were nearly 300ish candidates and I was at somewhere middle of the queue. Gods know how long the people at the back of the queue had to wait. 11. Then you pay a amount of Rs 270 for trial agaaaain and say the serial number that you noted earlier. 12. Then agaaaain the wait at the waiting area begin. They take the admit card and call you for the trial. I had to wait for almost 3.5 hrs. 13. Don't expect the bikes to be at top notch condition. They will be in the worst condition. Got a bike with accelerator too loose, had to extra rev the accelerator resulting touching of the lines at \"8\" twice. 🙂 14. Didn't get the chance to even touch the bike for even like for couple of minutes ater spending nearly 4 hours at trial's queue and 3 hrs at DoTM office's queue. 🫡🙂 15. Now for rehtrial, you can apply three times within 90 days from the first failed attempt. Now, I am actually drained so will not be applying for the re-trail soon.  All the best guys. Hope you conquer the Nepali license of bike/scooter 🥳  YouTube video explaining the trial: https://youtu.be/MukZKxaLpPQ?si=Fe-ZxX1iFWRR8NZS",

Can people travel to Namche Bazar in January. I understand it is an off-season month but is it possible to travel there in winter? And what will be the budget to get there? What mode of transportation should one chose? What about all the preparations like what basic neccessity items should one carry with them?   Thank you all in advance for your kind comments.

But at the end of the day, the laptops are the same - the only difference is the “authorized” tag.  Anyone can import laptops, and the warranty depends on the importer. Authorized sellers are retailers, not service centers. Basic hardware or OS issues can be fixed anywhere, and major issues are sent back to the original source.  So if someone offers a better price with a VAT bill and warranty, go for it. Boxes are often opened because resellers place warranty stickers on the screws to prevent tampering. You can ask for a sealed unit too, but you will definitely get the warranty sticker either way.  In the end, it’s your choice: pay extra for the authorized tag, or get the same laptop from a regular store at a lower price.|||Yes yes Mero ni yei thiyo question|||Check out authorized resellers of respective brands.|||Ask for the box: if the specs on the box doesn't match the laptop or is blacked out it's a sign.

Layout wise, everything is decent.   However, something just seems off.   You don't get the feeling like its a pretty or good looking design when you look at it.   Stuff may be functional but design wise, its not so good looking.   The hero section can be much much better.    Plus, there are tiny UI related bugs or mistakes.   1. In the accordion, both rows (accordion) opens up when you open only one.   2. You can click the login/sign-up button without even clicking the text.

Afai heram, esto sanity testing kura aucha. Sanity testing means \"Yo manche khusket ho ki haina\" test.  Anyone who is average(>40% in plus two) can easily complete engineering in Nepal.

(Even if the exams are open book, they are rigorous).|||Hmm I did CA  and I have left it. But the things are fundamentally different compared to engineering.  1. In CA you are barred from advancing to the next CAP or level if you don't successfully pass in the previous ones. In engineering you can go to the next semester.  2. The passing thingy is different. You got to pass in every subject and must score minimum of 50 percent in aggregate. Else you have to give exam of every subject even the subject you passed(unless you scored more than 60). The group system and exemption do make it a lil bit easy. Its different and sensible in engineering. If you passed you passed.  3. In engineering if you work hard its guaranteed that youll score well and do well. In CA passing percent is controlled by the institute ( thats what people say)so that is why people take a long time. As per ICAN the median age is 28-29 i guess to complete all levels.  4. The fields are completely different so  i can't say about the syllabus and content comparison.

You can get cheap nepali shared hosting for around 1700/year (including VAT). Load kati ko dhancha chai thaha bhayena since haven't faced high traffic lol. Domain can be free if you get .com.np (requires company registration documents), else around 2k NPR per year. Nepali payment integration ko high cost cha (check [recent discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technepal/comments/1p6irqa/onetime_api_charge_is_so_highkhalti_esewa_what/). They suggest using NepalPay, but seems you can't pay to it through eSewa). Haven't looked into int'l payments. Maybe look into dodo, paddle.   ECommerce site bhayesi automated emails chai alik dherai jancha (account created, OTP, invoice, ... WooCommerce le ni by default pathaucha). Email account ta hosting might provide for free. Shared hosting use garyo bhane there is risk of your email account getting blacklisted if other users using that host / ip address get marked as spam (but bhayo bhane dekha jayega. gotta reduce cost). Main chai you will need to setup SMTP to ensure emails get sent reliably (from contact forms, woocommerce automated emails). I use [Brevo free](https://www.brevo.com/pricing/see-all-features/) which does have limits on no. of emails you can send per day / month.   But all in all, Woo could be a good, cheap choice to get an ecomm site up and running quickly. You can use free themes or Elementor Pro (can find it for free due to having GPL license) to build the site without needing to write code. Elementor PRO + few plugins is really powerful. There's tons of features, plugins for ecommerce related things like product variants, collections, sales, discount codes, multi-currency support etc. Woo also has mobile app for managing orders, products and more.  Jati ramro design, best tech stack bhako site banaye ni, I'd say focus on business, marketing aspect too to ensure you actually get users and sales. Garne le daraz, blanxer bata ni garchan.

If this continues, it can lead to:  🔹 Reduction in rebar diameter due to corrosion   🔹 Volumetric expansion of rust, causing internal pressure   🔹 Concrete cover spalling   🔹 Loss of structural capacity at the affected sections   🔹 High risk of localized failure  When rebar corrosion becomes visible on the exterior of concrete, it indicates that the internal rusting process is advanced and has caused structural damage. Rusting rebar can expand up to 10 times its original volume, generating immense pressure that cracks, flakes, and ultimately breaks away the surrounding concrete. This leads to several visual signs of deterioration on the surface.   This clearly indicates potential quality compromise during construction, especially in curing, cover thickness, compaction, and concrete protection.  Gwarko overpass condition - [Gwarko overpass was inaugurated by Oli on June 20th. Took 2.5 years over deadline to finish and the result is a structure with water seeping into concrete likely corroding the exposed rebar sticking out. Now is a good time to force the contractor to carry out maintenance and waterproofing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1okjbcg/gwarko_overpass_was_inaugurated_by_oli_on_june/)  And while we’re at it, what’s with the constant honking?

            "body": "I remember not stuttering at all when I was a kid. Perhaps after I turned 5, this speech impediment started. And life has not been the same ever since.  Stuttering takes away your confidence, your ability to speak your mind and socialize in events. You sometimes can be something your friends or kids around you joke about. You have a hard time speaking on phone calls, saying the names of the places you want to get off to or saying where you caught the bus from. When you have to say the word that begins with something you have a hard time pronouncing, you stop, you go completely blank and instead of being ridiculed you shut up. It’s difficult. To have a voice and to not be able to use it to its full potential.  Lived long enough with this that now I am used to it. It is incurable or say it can be helped a little bit with speech therapy or some surgeries if it is caused by some physical defects (maybe in my case cuz I was born with a cleft palate). Now, I just try to find my way around with words.  But yeah, stuttering vanishes away when you’re comfortable talking with people or when you’re singing. I speak in NepalSocial discord and they will be shocked to learn that I stutter irl.   Do any of you stutter? How is life treating you? How bad is it? When did it start?",

Two Big Hydropower Projects; Upper Arun Hydropower Project-capacity of 1063 MW and Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project-capacity of 1200 MW, is officially announced to be commenced “without” any foreign back-support. GoN stated that these projects will be developed by fully utilizing the domestic resources.   The Ministry of Energy announced the development modality for Budhi Gandaki, which will follow a 70:30 debt-equity model. The project’s base cost is USD 2.77 billion (Rs 374B), rising to Rs 406B with interest during construction. The Government will invest Rs 247.47B, NEA Rs 24.37B, and a Rs 104B loan pool will come from EPF, CIT, SSF, insurance and re-insurance firms, HIDCL, Nepal Telecom, and commercial banks. Meanwhile, Nepal is independently advancing the Upper Arun Hydropower Project after uncertainty over World Bank financing. The project is estimated at USD 1.75 billion (Rs 214B) and will also use a 70:30 debt-equity structure. Of the equity, 51% will be promoter shares (provincial/local governments, NEA, Nepal Telecom, EPF, CIT, SSF, HIDCL, insurance companies, NEA subsidiaries), and 49% public/ordinary shares, including NRNs, migrant workers, promoter institution employees, affected communities, and the general public. Domestic banks and financial institutions are expected to provide Rs 168B in co-financing.",

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

            "body": "I never thought finding a simple flat in Kathmandu would be this exhausting and ridiculous. Me and my friend have been looking for a room or flat for more than two months now. Our budget is around 15k, which is pretty normal for two working professionals. He is a civil engineer and I am a software engineer. We are at the early stage of our careers so of course we have budget limits. That is why we decided to look for a 1BHK or even a 1BK. The place we are staying in right now does not have a kitchen and it makes life so hard.  We have already gone through two brokers and both experiences were just painful. The landlords they take us to have the weirdest criteria ever. Things like at least one girl must be there or no flat to only boys or no flat to Madhesis. Like seriously how is that not racist or at least straight up generalizing an entire group of people. It is so insulting. How is this not straight up discrimination. How are people so comfortable saying this out loud. They literally generalize an entire community without even blinking. We keep explaining that we are working professionals and responsible people but they do not care at all.  And the brokers themselves are another level of scam. First thing they do is ask for a non refundable registration fee. They promise they will find something according to our requirements and the moment you pay that fee the real nonsense starts. They show you rooms that are the complete opposite of what you asked for. They keep saying this is all that is currently available. After two or three useless visits they just start ignoring you. They stop picking up calls, they leave your WhatsApp messages on seen, they basically pretend you do not exist.  And when you finally go to their office to confront them they suddenly start calling their agents and acting like they are trying really hard to find options. Then they show you more places that are nothing like what you asked for. If you remind them that you clearly mentioned your requirements before filling their non refundable form they start making vague excuses. Like Landlord does not want bachelors. Landlord does not want only boys. Landlord does not want Madhesis. It is like they have a whole list of excuses ready.  At this point I am honestly sick of this flat hunting. It feels like every step of the process is designed to waste your time, scam your money, and judge you for things you cannot change. We are literally just trying to find a decent place to live.",

We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.  So chill, we \"South Asians\" are just starting to develop, delayed due to our colonial past. We got caught in the world population boom due to collective human knowledge growth, but unlike the rest of the world we had richer land and environment that could sustain billions of lives \"year round\". The education boom caught the world only after the population boom, making this rich land have more unbalanced population growth than the rest of the world.|||India is a permanent problem for Nepal.

(The last joined seat row and the seats in front of the bus will not be counted in the number of rows) (Example: for a bus of 6rows of seats on each side of the aisle, only 3 people will be standing). This will ensure that even for people who are standing, there is enough room to walk around while getting off the bus. For microbuses, the max passenger capacity should not exceed the number of seats available because in a microbus, it is not possible to travel standing comfortably.  2. Ban on speakers inside the bus: The noise levels when we are on the road are already too loud, and the driver playing music in the speakers just adds to the noise levels, and the loudness often exceeds the average of 80dB. It is illegal to exceed the loudness by 65dB in public places, even in the daytime, it's in the law.   3.

They even said all the employees who haven't completed 1 year didn't get dashain bonus, and they can't give it to only me.   I am so angry and confused right now. I even mentioned that labour law states every employee gets dashain bonus regardless of their work duration and they said well our sector doesn't follow it. No company in our sector gives dashain bonus before 1 year.   They even added if you are talking about the law. Then you should only get 19,550 mimimum monthly salary as that's the minimum salary requirement. WTF. I replied that's the bare minimum not what everyone gets. Especially not one with 2 degrees and with this much responsibilities. They meant that everyone should only get 19,550 no matter what work they do.   I am so pissed off and confused right now. They haven't even given my kartik's salary and I don't think they will. They might just tell adjust it from bonus.   What to do guys???",

Return the money, Kaile kai company mistakenly gives you wrong amount of salary too, it’s not your money, you should return it.  2. Do not burn bridges, its company policy not personal policy.   3. Look for another job, the best time to search for job is when you have a job. The company you’re  working for sounds toxic.  4. Get/Ask everything in writing. Use company email if possible. Spoken words don’t mean shit.  5. Labor office/labor court ma you can file petition of violation of labor if you think it’s necessary.   6. The minimum salary argument from them is dumb asf and won’t hold up in court.|||I am not sure about the return policy but as far as my knowledge holds, it is pro-rata basis so if they are saying 17k, please calculate and degrees, experience and responsibilities are not related, I guess.|||Many offices give bonuses to staff after a probationary period of usually 6-12 months.

I recently got a dog myself so I want to explain how much a big responsibility it is. If anyone is wanting to get a dog please take the time to read this.  I had adopted a stray dog when I was a kid. But few months back I purchased my first breed dog. And there is a lot of difference between them. Stray dogs are tough but I found out that pure breed dogs like golden retrievers need a lot of care and they are more vulnerable to sicknesses.  If you can’t handle the expenses and care, do NOT absolutely get a pure bred dog.   You have to care for puppies like a human Baby. You have to feed it highly nutritious meals that can be costly, vaccinate them against multiple diseases like rabies, parvo, distemper, Covid, etc on time in quality clinics and vaccinate them yearly, give them health supplements, spend a lot of time daily grooming them, clothe them, clean after them, take them walks, pick up their poop, train them, and Teti matra nabhaera spend quality time with them to make them happy.     Also they can give you allergies (skin, respiratory, etc). You will have to clean your house a lot because they shed hair.    Also maybe you are thinking that you have a house maid or helper so they can take care of the dog. If so , please keep in mind that the dog will see the house helper as their owner - not you.  Since the house helper is feeding, grooming her and taking her on walks, the dog will get attached to them. So in case one day the house helper leaves or anything, the dog will miss them a lot and get depressed.  Mero thulba ko ghar ko dog ran away after the house keeper left. The poor dog thought her owner had left her and ran away to look for her and never returned.    Pure breeds can get easily ill and vet treatments are expensive. My dog got parvo and her treatment cost around 30k.  So, please, unless you have the time, devotion, and money to afford a dog, don’t.   For myself, getting a dog has been the best decision. But I had never imagined that I would have so much responsibilities with it. I want my dog to have her best life so I’ll do anything for her.  I have had so much expenses since I got her, I have cried so many times, my sleeping, working, daily life schedules have turned upside down. But still I could never imagine selling her or giving away.   If you don’t have this much devotion, do not get a dog just to regret it.",

It definitely depends on the breed and how you are handling the dog too. Some people go way beyond and above and treat them like a literal human child deteriorating their own natural immunity. Unless its like really toxic they are fine with most human edible stuffs hai. The most crucial part is its going be a time commitment. If you are going to have a dog you should be prepared to have them actively in your life for a better part of a decade. Many people dont realise this that its going to be a huge time commitment and of course you do have to spend time with your dog and take it out on walks for it not to destroy your place. Mostly do research on the breed before hand and research its temperaments and if it matches your lifestyle.|||General rule of thumb vaneko do not get any pets unless you can afford, me and my sister got rabbits, tara ek hapta paxi nasakera feri bech dim😆😭|||Thanks for sharing this.

Its the same with RSP|||You technically can't just give your shares back Nepal ma without selling so you have to make it like you sold it.  Sweat shares ko concept nai xaina legally.  Rabi is an MD ani that loan was taken for Galaxy TV in his name tara wihch is why Galaxy company has paid installments for Rabis loans  There's literally no proof of Rabi directly benefitting from Sahakari ko paisa.  Galaxy ma GB le tyo paisa lyao ani Rabi was MD so he is liable to that but that's not sahakari ko case that's company related case.  Rabi is accountable he has logically answered all of his allegations. There's a paper I had read its like a short book that allegadly Rabi wrote from prison where he has answered all of your allgeations I read those all and it kind of made sense.  I don't know if its available online.  I'm not sure what agenda you're trying to push with your half research and all.

Just look at the bigger picture and you'll understnad if he really did something wrong or is being framed vanera this is pure political revenge.|||let me clarify. Rabi joins Galaxy TV and his fee was share of the company. But legally you cannot obtain share without evidence of money deposit. So in name of rabi GB rai have to deposit money. For that he took loan in nae of rabi from Suryalaxmi sahakari and deposited it to Gorkha media and give ravi lamichane his share certificates.   While this is ilegal and ravi knows it being done. but thats how most of system works. But this doesn't make ravi a sahakari thug, ravi is in jail mainly becasue he was about to go after congress leaders.|||Looks like these are what matan kaji brought as evidence.

Anything above 40 Lakhs is HNWI.|||Am I the only one wondering how to make the 6 figure income staying in Nepal here?|||I have a family of four (me, my wife and two young children). We built a home 12 years ago. We have a petrol car and my wife has a startup. We have around 40 lakh debt remaining from financing our home, car and the business (important as debt servicing has cash outflow implications).   Here is our monthly cash outflow  Children's school fee - 45k Home operations (food/kitchen, cleaning supplies) 30k Car operation (fuel, insurance, servicing, tax etc) 25k Internet, cable/streaming - 3k Clothing 5k Entertainment (restaurants/movies/holidays etc)- 8k Debt servicing- 85k Health - 4k Life insurance - 30k Others - 5k  Average monthly cash outlay = ~240k  This is the way we spend our money. It might look different based on your lifestyle, the choices you make etc. For us, we make a little over this amount (after tax and SSF deduction). As far as \"have we made it?\", sometimes I feel like we have and then there are days when I feel that is not enough as there is still so much we want to do. It's all relative, I guess!|||280k gross monthly. 75k goes to tax, 75k goes to PF, 175k on hand. No rent, no loans. Already have 1 car, 1 bike. big expenses are child's school and babysitter. Feels good to go to any restaurant and order without considering price, and also take 1 bidesh holiday per year. 175k seems like good money, but with more money, you tend to spend more, buy premium products, so saving is always difficult, especially if you are married with children. Still does not feel like I have made it in life lol.|||The answer to your question is very subjective and depends on your situation.   If I talk about myself, at 26 years old, I earn between 150K to 175K a month (in KTM), including income from part-time and freelance work. On the surface, that might seem like a comfortable salary, and many might assume I’m living a lavish lifestyle. However, the reality is much different.  A significant portion of my income goes toward fulfilling responsibilities, like repaying monthly EMIs for loans taken by my parents, covering rent for my flat, and handling utilities like food, internet, electricity, and water. I also support my younger brother, who is currently studying undergrad, which adds another layer of financial strain. Any leftover income is typically put toward reducing the principal of family loans, which I’m struggling to make much of a dent in.  Despite having earned this amount for over two years, working day and night with only 4-5 hours of sleep over the past few years, I’ve barely been able to save 40K for myself as of today. I haven’t had the chance to upgrade my old 2015 bike, because even that would require extra money I just can’t spare. And when it comes to spending on things like dining out with friends, I find myself hesitating, weighing the cost every time.  In short, while my income might seem substantial, the financial obligations I carry have left me with little room for personal enjoyment or saving, making it a constant balancing act. The gist is that the same figure which allows someone to enjoy a lavish lifestyle may not be enough to sustain a bare minimum living standard for others.|||Hey commentator, who are saying 1 lakh,2 lakh and much more idk which job pays u that i would love to know, most of government jobs pay  around 30k monthly, idk how we get into 1 or 2 lakh|||People with 50k salary ni Nepal can afford to be out of job for much longer than people with 100k salary in US.

By that logic, since Nepal gets massive aid, grants, trade concessions, open-border benefits from countries like India, China, Bangladesh, the US, and half of Europe… what does that make Nepal then?  Exactly, it doesn't make logical sense.  Special rates and agreements are granted by countries to neighbors based on treaties, history, and mutual benefit. In fact, that's how literally every region on earth operates.  Bhutan did not one day wake up and say, \"Let's charge Nepal $100 just for fun.\" They have a sustainability model that applies to every international tourist, except the one country that they have a unique treaty with.  Nepal gives reduced visa fees, scholarships, and trade breaks with some countries. Does it mean Nepal is \"owned\" by them?  No. That means there's diplomacy. I know, shocking. Maybe instead of calling Bhutan a \"slave,\" people should accept that Bhutan values controlled tourism, clean environments, and long-term planning, something other countries struggle with because they chase volume over quality.

Disclamer, Before doing anythig do research for at least a months. You can always find people who have done this before.    Invest in NEPSE? Which stocks and why?   = Because Investing in NEPSE is investing in Nepal and Nepal price will increase on time.   Start a business? What’s profitable in 2025 Nepal?   = Yes, there are lots of businesses that you can start or invest in a business with the capital and take a stake at those company. But do some research.  If something is Made in Nepal the product is seen as a pride. If you can market well you can make a business.   Buy land outside KTM before it pops?   = Land outside KTM, but it must be a busy area where other local people can lease the property for a do their business. But land near Kathmandu is also hiking so 20 lakhs mignt be not be enough. You can invest with someone with similar intention.   Import something new and flip it?   = Importing a most used product from China and then selling it to the people within the country or abroad is also a great idea. But it requires lots of market research. Your financials must be very strong. You have to add Shipping, logistics, dead stocks, rent, manpower, and electricity costs with other costs. Don't go for the unique product rather go for a product that is an advanced version of a traditional product yet useful. For a unique product, you have to create a market for yourself and you don't have a better cost estimation.   Do nothing because Nepal is too risky?   = Not really, Nepal is a growing market. Of course the government is not stable at all and it can change many things on business. However, investing in insurance, SIP, promoter shares have been a good alternative.     And if it was me with 20 lakhs, i would go for establishing an experience center where i promote new product of younger business with some charges. And for the experience center, i will change the product in a weekly or monthly basis.

Around 8 lakhs should go into strong NEPSE dividend stocks like good banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds, which give stable 10–14% returns plus possible capital gains. Another 8 lakhs should be used to start a small, high-demand business such as water jar delivery, a mobile accessories + repair shop, or electric scooter rentals—these businesses typically generate ₹40,000–1 lakh per month and can realistically add 12–18 lakhs in a couple of years. The remaining 4 lakhs can be used for a high-margin import/trading side hustle (earbuds, powerbanks, smartwatches, small electronics), which can double if done correctly. This balanced method keeps your capital safe, gives monthly income, and adds a high-return element—making it possible, in Nepal’s current market, to reach 40–50 lakhs without depending on unrealistic hype or luck.|||I might increase a bit , but the 50 l|||I'd invest it some low cost index funds and then just work my arse off.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

There, people respect your ideas, give you support, and actually let you try new things. You learn a lot in that process, and there’s real accountability for your work  and that’s what makes the job interesting. But in Nepal, most companies are full of office politics. People focus more on chilling than building something meaningful. Then suddenly, one day, all the “fun” stops and you’re expected to show results overnight. That’s when everything turns into chaos. I personally feel Nepal’s IT sector is not growing the way it should because of this mindset. Management hesitates to try new ideas, and most companies are still following the same blueprint they’ve been using for the past 10 years. No innovation, no mindset shift.  In my opinion, work becomes fun and challenging only when you are given responsibility and the freedom to try new things. Otherwise, it’s just the same rat race, the same routine, and the same day repeating again and again.|||That is why I quit, and I am doing something on my own.

The same boring schedule is real but try to enjoy the weekends to reset. And take out 25 - 60 mins of time everyday to practice interview questions and maybe some personal projects that interests you. With 1 YOE the only way to overcome what you are describing is switching the job itself which should increase your salary, network and confidence to have a kinda fresh new start. About finalizing the whole thing, most companies don't research or even have time to do so ig. Also the requirements changing are frustrating af but i think we learn something at least. So i highly recommend start making a proper portfolio with proofs of work in GitHub and CV, apply to new jobs and prep for interviews and try to switch the job.   My current life is also same as yours rn ( 3 YOE ) Clg - work - learn - sleep - repeat. I kind of have passion for coding though. I admit it gets boring but there is always a small excitement that keeps me going. And my only formulae is i try to enjoy the weekends to my fullest so that the whole week becomes worth it. And final suggestion which are just fundamentals ig.. take proper breaks, hydrate throughout the day, workout and have proper sleep schedule. I hope this helps a little.

I got my laptop when I was in class 10 and ever since I started my grind. At first, I used to watch a lot of video in youtube which didn’t make sense later. Firstly I started learning flutter which I did not enjoy that much so I switched to python and later learned few ml tools, frameworks and concepts but it was way more hard than I thought it would be. All this from class 10 to 11. After that again I switched to web development. I previously made few projects with HTML and css so I moved directly to js. Due to little previous knowledge of programming leaning js was abit easy for me then I continued till my 2nd year of college learning MERN stack. All of this when I choose biology due to family pressure in +2. I’ve even stayed till 2am grinding my ass off. This was my passion. I didn’t have much time for internship due to college so I started hunting projects in fiverr and upwork. Finally all those hard work paid off. I got a project few months ago which turned out to be a long project based agreement and it’s going on. I still try to manage work, college and everyday learning as much as I can.  I feel so nice that I am living the life I wrote on sticky note as a motivation on my wall. Just wanted to share my 4 year long story. Maybe this can motivate newbies who has same passion in tech. Thank you",

You just talked about AI then how can only few IT fields be saturated.   The concept of programming is same with some differences in various language. Nobody wanted to switch because we forget (as you know). Every language has their nuances, painpoints that we learned through experience BUT NOW, that gap is filled by AI.  If you have high experience in one language, If you can know the tasks that you have to do to make a software then you can Easily switch to another.   Like Backend devs know that in frontend they have to make UI elements through libraries and the way to apply styles but styling is a pain-in-ass without Xp. But now, they can do it by uploading design photo to chatgpt, copilot itself. AI wont build entire project, but with its help you can go step by step. Copilot Agent in premium is Fkin beast that scares me tbh. It reads ur related files and does changes so well (within a minute).  Frontend devs are not blind to Apis and how backend apis connect to DBs. Backend has become more easier with AI imo. Because you dont even need to upload images, just a structure or design pattern in mind from DB to Api. AI will do that task for you. If you need to change, ask AI for better way then AI will do that too. And, Language syntax isnt even an barrier at this point. Since, you know what u want, AI will correct ur syntax. C# , Java, Python, doesnt matter if u know them or not, at this point.|||you are just in third sem, dont worry, i have completed but jobless haha",

WP does have limitations, such as security issues in third-party plugins, performance, cost, scalability, flexibility, granular customization etc. But it's completely fine to use WP for a basic website with less traffic. Not everything needs an over-engineered solution. Another thing to consider is that you will have more career growth opportunities when you learn programming languages like JavaScript and JS frameworks like NextJS, React, NodeJS, etc. Also, no one codes everything from start to finish. Every dev uses frameworks, libraries, packages, and, these days, AI to make life easy.|||I worked on a three page or five page website building job on WordPress... Fourteen years ago |||For cms site like news portal, wordpress works like a charm|||After you get comfortable with basic HTML and CSS, you can play around with WordPress and Elementor to get better at visualizing what your code does. Elementor is just drag-and-drop, and it also adds something extra to your CV. After that, I’d suggest learning JavaScript and following the roadmap from there.|||WordPress isn't really a no code tool. It has been in market for quite some time, so there are plethora of plugins available making it possible to be used as no code platform.   If you want to make the best use of WordPress, you need to learn coding. it's a CMS at it's core with website builder like capabilities on top. You can even create the frontend in next.js or any other framework and just use WordPress like a cms backend.|||i tried once and i personally felt using wordpress more difficult than coding in HTML, CSS and JS.|||Depends on the need. For a static simple website, WordPress is good|||Depends on what the site will have. Simple page bhaye index.html matra handiye huncha or some drag n drop builder. Aru choices ni cha but I've been leaning towards using WP for almost every new site. WP is a good choice for company information / brochure sites, blogs, ecommerce too (using WooCommerce).  There's a ton of different ways to use WP. You can write the site [fully through code](https://developer.wordpress.org/), use no-code builders (Elementor is bloated but does the job for any brochure site), or use WP's built-in Gutenberg editor + blocks (kinda awkward but recommended by many), plus many more ways. Check discussions on r/Wordpress as well as this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/dmcedr/complete_beginner_into_wordpress_development_need/f510kko/). Probably best to not follow their advice on setting permissions to 444 though. Can be a pain later if you need to modify those files.   I'd suggest writing blogs on WP (& trying to improve SEO for it) or building client websites w/ it to learn. Static website ko lagi WP could be overkill (i.e. having an entire database, having to maintain plugin updates semi-regularly to prevent security issues, paying for hosting). Check this [list of static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/). You can use simple markdown files for content, host them for free and not have to maintain them as much. Hugo is very popular but docs are kinda hard for beginners. Astro is pretty cool (is JS-based & lets you bring in any frontend library like react) but doesn't have concept of easily changing themes like Hugo / WordPress.   Having said all that, these frameworks will come and go, and maybe change how they work massively. WP has been around for a long time and is also easy to update and maintain. A lot of websites are built on WordPress so your knowledge will carry over if you need to help out on / inherit someone's website. Lesser chances of coming across these other SSGs unless it's NextJS.

So, it's easy for U.S companies to get this talented people cause they don't have to do extra hardwork to find talented people from all over the world. Their requirements are fullfilled by these Indian and Chinese talent pools. And both India and China have large population than any other countries. So, it's obvious that most of the talented people come from these countries.  Whereas, Nepal is a country with small population with worst education system. So, it's hard to find that Nepali People in Quant Finance. I know some Nepali people who are in Finance but not in large companies. So, Large Companies like JP Morgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and Morgon Stanley hire students mainly Indian and Chinese students from Top universities. And US is known for attracting international talents. Even US doesn't have talented people even tough they are 3rd largest population countries. So, Finding Nepali in U.S top companies at Quant Finance is almost impossible.|||A lot of people from Nepal are in big tech firms and are involved in software engineering.

These neo religious cultist folks see every spot with a view as their own treasure box. Build a temple. Than a cable car. Then rent out or lease the land for hotels.

Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

There was also no mass campaigns raised for voter awareness etc. The outcome will most likely be the same, if the election is held again considering the amount of votes UML and congress received proportionally.   Instead of fighting a united front everyone opened there own party which further decreases the vote share and increases their chances.

You will be amazed how popular Hitler was in Germany.|||Depends on what type of ans you want.   Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He became popular by lottery and so as did Sudan, nothing special, which is why the political party leaders are openly challenging the zen-z protest outcomes|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Democracy doesn't work trying to find a perfect leader!  And that guy Miraj is a trash 🗑️|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

He was brutally questioned, trolled, slammed from every direction even by his own people. But he never complained. Not even a single word. He quietly accepted all the pain, all the criticism… and as a fan, it hurted to see people mock & make fun of him just because he couldn’t win something for his country despite giving everything he had.  But he never gave up. He kept trying again, and again, and again.  Today he has achieved everything. And honestly, it’s not even his trophies or the goat status that matter to me. What truly inspires me is the kind of human being he is. I learned the meaning of loyalty from him. How someone of his caliber with the whole world at his feet can still be as humble as the guy next door. That rarest of humility is what made me admire him the most. And spirit.... so quiet yet never-give-up spirit without any arrogance but just pure passion.   Thank you Messi, for being that figure in my life.❤️",

So tomorrow I have a mathematics test. I like mathematics. I am like, you know, I'm not completely clueless. I'm not clueless at all in math. I just need to learn the formula. And that's it. I know math. Okay, like I'm a little bit, even a tiny bit and that is a very big bit, confident in math. So tomorrow I have a test on four chapters combined. I think it is of 50 marks or something. I don't know. So, the chapters are indefinite integration, differentiation, probability distribution, binomial distribution. I will not have to pull and all nighter today.   So, yeah! Xoxo!🎀✨",

For eg: students could just understand a concept even without the teacher writing anything on the board and just explaining verbally but not get a single thing watching a video showing examples on the screen. (Assuming the videos aren't well picked - again improper utilisation of those tools)   Though I'm also in favour of some different approach than the same repetitive traditional whiteboards. Screens and digital teaching isn't a must if it's too far away for Nepal but still those shouldn't be the only next step. There could be various other ways of teaching. Like those videos online that showcase real life examples, or those involving student participation in learning concepts.  The \"teacher's should be respected and obeyed at all times mentality.\" Can lead to students never attempting to even question anything.   The best way of putting how I feel teaching should be can be taken from the show (I know show but still it's not impossible you know) : Boy meets world 🌍 and It's continuation Girl meets world.  - Mr. Feeny, - Mr. Turner, - Mr. Matthews ,  (All from those sitcoms are by far my versions of what should be aimed for. Though it's fully fictional it's how I feel)|||Real world examples",

Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours.

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option.

Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

Traveled to two countries for free via a BIG COMPANY, Won so many tech competitions and made a good name in the tech community.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

These neo religious cultist folks see every spot with a view as their own treasure box. Build a temple. Than a cable car. Then rent out or lease the land for hotels. This is their modus operandi.|||Ganesha is actually inspired by Mahayana and Vajryan Buddhism Elephant God.  Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Democracy doesn't work trying to find a perfect leader!  And that guy Miraj is a trash 🗑️|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before.

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

            "body": "It is now clear that kulman had already planned out to make new party. He was waiting for green signal from RSP if they give him president or not. I respect him for his contribution in reformation in electricity of Nepal. But that don’t give him excuse to whatever theater he is creating now.  He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions. Mahesh karauna thale dekhi he is kind of caved in totally and his silence has taken many hopes from people.",

Three different blokes with 3 different political agendas and most importantly three famous social media personalities.|||People practice democracy = People are mad anyway|||Kulman isn’t gonna be the chairman of his new party.  Former energy secretary is going to be. He is just going to a member. So the premise of your argument is flawed.|||Why should he join RSP? He is the probably the most capable person to lead a country right now and you want him to work under Sobita Gautam and DP Aryal.

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge!

These neo religious cultist folks see every spot with a view as their own treasure box. Build a temple. Than a cable car. Then rent out or lease the land for hotels.

Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

You will be amazed how popular Hitler was in Germany.|||Depends on what type of ans you want.   Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He became popular by lottery and so as did Sudan, nothing special, which is why the political party leaders are openly challenging the zen-z protest outcomes|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig. I shouted at them once and finally they stopped.|||Kavya na jau bhanxu hai Discount kei ma xaina +2 Ko lagi SXC ya sasto, ramro ma gaye hunxa for science Management ho bhane global|||Me who completed +2 in 1 lakh|||Esto mahango cha +2 aile?|||\\+2 colleges are overrated. colleges will contribute almost nothing to shape your future in +2.|||Kavya and Ace ko last year ko result kasto cha??

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle.
