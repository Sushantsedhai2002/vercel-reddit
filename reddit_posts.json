            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

The people who threw trash on the ground were probably biharis and school kids. Honestly Pokhara lakeside has a great potential to be a great tourist place internationally, especially the night life. I was just grateful that the lake was totally clean",

Some accused them of abandoning Nepal, saying things like “They should be banned from entering Nepal” or “Their Nepali citizenship must be immediately revoked.” Others even called them traitors and insulted the Nepali government for allowing it.  But in a surprising twist, it was later revealed that the couple weren’t Nepali at all—they were from Sri Lanka and had never even been to Nepal.  When the truth came out, both the Sri Lankan couple and the Nepali commenters were left shocked.  This incident, sparked merely by assumptions based on their Nepali looking faces, became a reflection of how quickly and blindly many react online without knowing the full story.",

            "body": "Lately, I’ve been noticing something across different political posts on Nepali social media.  Whenever there’s a post about **Balen**, I check the negative comments — and almost every time, they come from people affiliated with **Yemale**. Same thing happens with **Rabi related** **, Sudhan Gurung related, GenZ's related posts**. It’s always Yemale-affiliated accounts doing the unnecessary or hateful commenting. I rarely see that kind of behavior from Congress supporters or unaffiliated Gen Z users.  Just recently, a youth affiliated with Yemale even filed a case against Balen. And again, the comment sections on those news posts were full of Yemale supporters spreading nonsense.  Even in real life, it feels similar. The other day I went to a stationery shop to buy a practical file, and a 40–50-year-old guy was loudly saying people who protested should be punished. After he left, my thulbuba (the shop owner) told me that guy is a Yemale-affiliated gunda — comes to read newspapers for free, praises KP Oli non-stop, and then leaves.  Honestly, at this point, I feel like that saying — *“You can make a person Yemale, but you can’t make Yemale a person”* — wasn’t just a meme or a joke. 😂  Am I the only one seeing this trend, or is it really that Yemale supporters have turned into the most intolerant bunch lately?",

I'm sure many of you are freelancing, working for a firm among many things, i want you to take 1 minute of your time to explain what is your ideal company in Nepal that you would love to work on? Think how people are gaga over working for Meta, Apple etc.  What would you make you feel that type of excitement?  If its money, then how much?  If its more than money, then what?

More over if we tweak a geo-politics side then China will never allow west to get their desired goal for AI. The biggest move China can play is to simply attack TAIWAN and 90% of chip supply chain will be gone. No NVIDIA, No Apple,No Palantir,No Meta  will survive this CHIP defecit. The logical argument would be \"why won't the west just buy chips from SAMSUNG \" But we knew what happened to NVIDIA 30 series GPUs when they use samsung chips.

It will keep growing. We all have experienced the ease that AI gives us.  The lack of hardware and chips to support this huge usage of AI seems impossible.

There is many other issues like the focus on profit from big wall street but also the limitation of scaling beyond gpt 5 and more.

Recently, I thought… why not revive it but this time, make it more valuable for us — BCA/MCA students and tech/engineering aspirants?  So, I’m rebuilding the server and adding a new section mainly for studying and exam preparation, especially for:  CUET / NIMCET aspirants  IT/CS-related entrance exams  General study discussions, coding help, and peer learning  Link to the exact server - https://discord.gg/wq7MW6MPg  I want this to be a chill yet productive space where we can study together, exchange notes, share resources, and support each other in our academic and technical goals.  👉 I request the mods not to remove or ban this post, as I’m genuinely doing this for the betterment of our subreddit members — to give everyone a focused and helpful community space outside Reddit.  If you’re preparing for CUET, NIMCET, or any IT/CS competitive exam, or even just want a study group with like-minded students — you’re welcome to join our Discord server (link in comments).

            "body": "Already have 4 daughter and still trying for 5th time in hopes of getting a son, let the woman rest now.      \"Bangsa naas huncha\", lol why does it even matter if it's woman's health on the line. There are so many people still trying for son for this exact reason.  My one relative lost her life cause they wanted a son and she was old and couldn't survive it. Sister is growing with a step-mother now.     It's just sickening to hear those words now \"bangsa naas huncha\", daughter is also your \"bangsa\", what's wrong if her caste would be different after marriage as your blood is still in her and it will live with her and later with her daughter/son.     While there are lot of good parents who don't care and just happy with their daughter, we see lot of people having a daughter and then a small boy child.   Maybe it's just they want another kid and not specifically a son but there are huge number of parents getting pregnant again for a son for only \"bangsa\" reason.     If both wants then maybe it's right, my only problem is that when woman is old and have 1 or more daughter and yet they are still trying for a son which can put her in serious health problem later just so that \"bangsa naas nahos\".",

Within a few days or even hours, they start sharing everything personal - physically or emotionally, thinking it’s real connection. But many times, it ends with heartbreak, betrayal, and depression.  Dear sisters, you came here with a goal. Your parents back in Nepal have big hopes for you. You are studying, working hard, building your future. Please don’t let loneliness or emotional pressure make you trust the wrong people.  Yes, it’s not easy living alone in a foreign country. We all feel the need for love, care, and company. But remember, some people take advantage of good hearts. Once you lose your confidence or self-worth, it’s hard to rebuild.  So please, be smart, protect your dignity, focus on your dreams. Real connection takes time, and real people will respect your boundaries.  If you’re reading this and it hits close to home, take it as a reminder that you are stronger and more valuable than you think. Stay safe and take care of",

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||No offense but submissive girls are cute|||Khoi k ho k ho on 1 side you get normal girls who you talk and see ra aba tyo sites haru ma ra prostitute garni haru , are they the same ki euta invisible line xa we can't see to differentiate idk....|||widebody    bhutanese refuge   etc etc yestai haina?",

            "body": "Hi everyone, I wanted to get some honest perspectives here.  I’m 24F, work full time in IT, and have never dated anyone.   Growing up, I always thought I’d marry someone from my caste and background — mostly because of my upbringing and the fear of disappointing my family. I live in a part of the U.S. where finding someone who fits my family’s preferences has always been tough, so dating was never really on the table for me.  Now that I’m at an age where my parents are starting to bring up marriage more seriously, I’ve told them they can start looking for someone for me. Part of me feels like this makes sense and aligns with my values, but another part wonders if I should be more open to finding someone on my own.  Dating apps honestly scare me, and I’m not sure what other options I even have if I don’t go the arranged route.  For those of you who’ve gone through something similar — how did you handle it? Did you go through an arranged process, or did you try meeting someone on your own? Any regrets or advice you’d share?",

My monthly expenses don’t even hit 40k npr, since I live with my family, and I can save around 300k npr per month.  I have flexible work hours and can work from anywhere in Nepal.

Earning in $$$ feels like heaven.   My advice for young Nepalese on Reddit:  \\- Bachelor ma pick up a strong tech skill. You will never regret it later.  \\- Ani, If you are a tech student, don’t ignore coding, it opens a lot of doors later on.  **My role: Offensive Security Engineer, Certs I’ve earned: OSCP, OSWE, CREST (CPSA + CRT)**",

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||Bhik me kuch dedo humko bhaisahab|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

(For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

We need to fully control private businesses centrally, develop 5 year plans like China to take advantage of the global trade market and allow foreign companies to manufacture inside of Nepal.   Once they start production, we learn how to produce our own products by looking at how they produce and then we can upgrade from a resource exporting country to a manufacturing economy.

The snowfall in the larke la pass made impossible to complete larke la pass and had to return back to starting poing ( machhakhola ). The way back was also not easy due to rain and landslides.   On the way donwhill there were plenty of landslides and one of the foreigners slipped off while crossing one of them. It was in between pewa and nyak. Although her body was trapped in stones she was breathing. The porter and guides willing to help couldn’t do  so because they didnot had anything to rescue her. Maybe a strong rope could help. There was not even a rope or other emergency kits on the way. Later after so many hours, the police had to carry rope from down where they could not make it till the incident place where the victim has to die helplessly. This is just extreme level of careless despite of taking so many permit charges for the foreigners trekking in manslu circuit.  They have no emergency rescue plan such as information flow system, emergency tools on the way. If you have been to this circuit trek its very risky.  There is need for lots of improvements in terms of safety in the cricuit. What do the so called authorities of conservation area plan for this?  The trekkers are paying their lives.",

            "body": "TLDR: A Nepali student at Ole Miss asked JD Vance why legal immigration is being cut after leaders promoted the American dream to those who followed the rules. The exchange was calm factual and brave.  Video:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8)  At the University of Mississippi a Nepali calmly and clearly questioned JD Vance during a Turning Point event. She asked why leaders who once promoted the American dream to legal immigrants now argue to shrink legal pathways and say we do not belong. Her poise facts and courage were inspiring.  For many of us this moment feels personal. Legal immigrants study work pay taxes and strengthen communities. When people in power target legal pathways it is fair and necessary to speak up with respect and clarity.  Gen Z in Nepal recently showed remarkable civic courage during protests against corruption. That same spirit peaceful principled and focused on justice belongs in every place. From Kathmandu to a college campus in Mississippi we Nepalis should raise our voices against injustice misinformation and the scapegoating of immigrants.  This moment matters because it centers fairness and the promises made to those who followed the rules. It highlights how rhetoric at political events touches real lives of people waiting in long lines for visas and green cards. It also connects to a wider wave of youth led civic action that insists on dignity and accountability.  Note:   She is Nepali, but most Indian media are portraying her as Indian. Did not expect anything less. 😅",

The education system lives up to the expectation, if you choose to study. There is still an opportunity, if you choose to work hard.   There are a few extra hurdles along the way, which aren't permanent.|||I didn’t like it that she is holding US responsible for us coming here- you were the one who wanted us here and made us spend our money and time. Nobody from US came to me and asked me to come here, I did it because of that image I had of the US.   Other than that she was amazingly calm and quite reasonable in her questions.  Vance was refreshingly good in his answer, but he always has been good with words.|||Didn’t know she was a Nepali. I didn’t like some of the questions but otherwise she was very thoughtful and calm about it. Kudos.|||I'm going to be honest, watching her make assumptions about what US is and Isn't was very frustating. Noone in US sold her a dream, she came up with the idea of the dream herself, but the dream isn't guarenteed, especially if the native citizens are already strugging. Immigration is a hot topic right now, especially in US. Youth unemployment rates for US Citizens are already bad enough, why should the country then put the immigrants dream above their own native people?

Just because we don’t like someone or don’t agree with something they say, they cant be wrong at all times.  The immigration is an issue in the US and is in all over the world. The system is talking about putting proper immigration law in place which is valid. It is not saying that we will give you student visa but won’t let you study. It may be saying that if you come as a Student, you shall remain a student and have to return after you complete your education.

            "body": "In the long course of history, nature’s most capable predator evolved not only in body, but in mind. With consciousness came conscience — yet we still ask: is that conscience innate, or carved into us by our surroundings? What is good, and what is bad? Is it truly universal, or only what our minds accept as moral, rational, or ethical? Perhaps “good” and “bad” are just perspectives formed by the finest instrument nature ever created: the human brain. From west to east, humans have vast differences. Was it evolution alone that shaped us into social beings, or the cultures we built around our fears, hopes, and beliefs? Culture — different everywhere — has long been our guide, telling us what is right and what is wrong. Alongside faith in deities, these traditions became the unwritten rules that shaped our conscience. But what have we carried from the past? Often not the reasons behind our rituals, only the instructions on how to perform them. Not the “why,” just the “how.” We repeat steps inherited from centuries ago, even when the world around us has changed. What we sow today determines tomorrow, yet what we need to do today may not be what was needed hundreds of years ago. We follow traditions hoping they will bring the same results they once did, without asking whether the original purpose still exists — or whether our actions need to evolve just as life evolves. Evolution hasn’t stopped, but sometimes we stop it from making sense. Out of fear of the unknown, fear of being separated from the group, we continue as we always have, even when our conscience whispers that understanding the reason is more important than repeating the act. We are social animals, yes — but we are also thinkers. And perhaps the real evolution lies in questioning what we follow, not abandoning it, but understanding it, and guiding it toward the world we live in today.",

But for future-proofing this type of incident, I highly recommend a vehicle tracker. You gan get cheap ones from Daraz. If you get a Sinohero device, you don't have to pay the yearly subscription. It's free for life, will just cost you higher upfront (mine cost 8k). I recharged Rs.500 and it ran for 2 years. For advanced features(that require internet or calls), you will need to recharge often, maybe like 1500/year. But for basic tracking, Rs.500 will basically run the GPS until your validity expires, I think. You could even recharge lower - just upto the point where you maximize your validity.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

Even I don't know OP. I am sure he/she will get in because nepal ma internship pauna first hunai parxa.  Mero kati jana sathi le ni sodera hunxa to bare Bootcamp ho ki Internship nai vanera  and as I was a one of the recent one who did bootcamp last year . Bootcamp lekeni its an internship.  Ma taw bootcamp vaneko pay garna parne hola vanethe but it was free. Hybrid tiyo so I could manage my timings  And as I needed certificate for my internship for college they provided me with a internship certificate.   Best part chai they actually looked into my CV and askes relevant questions.  Its kinda competitive as many students reach out as per I know 800 students applied last year Here are some of the things you should understand to increase your chances .  Dont reach out to other developers or anyone who isnt directly in the hiring process. One of the main thing in that post Internship ma referral ko kam nai xaina and thats to the point. Paxi bujdai jada taha vayo ki as they dont get any bonus referral internship ma so they dont have to do so.  CV ma use numbers instead of full form of text ,no photos hobbies or GPA. Proshore doesnt care about those. They just want people who can show they want to learn. Mero Gpa nai dosta tiyo and Projects were also kinda average  but still I got in  because I could explain any thing they asked about my project. Drive chai huna paryo.  Always and remember always apply through Company website. Linkedin just visibility pauna use garxan derai jaso company le this included. Many dont even check those pages so always apply through companies websites and portal. Because it shows that you are actually interested and aren't mass applying. So first hunai parxa.  Yesko faeda vaneko chai Proshore uses different process to track applicant and your chances would be high.  Aja email garyo vane taw ajai ramro. This was the biggest thing that helped me the most. Ma chai apply garepaxi ni email chai garthe as Hr haru le email open rate uni haru ko manager le herxan so it helps.  And I took into into next level .

Hola you have no referral but you can write refer from linkedin or whatever platform you got the first news. I did exactly this  and body ma Refer by Linkedin lekethe and well I got a call tomorrow  had a very good laugh with hr as she said it was creative.   Kei unique nagare taw garai xa internship lai.  Post is getting long so if anyone is interested to know more let me know here and I would reply to you. Malai yo lekna taw partena as why would I do marketing of a company but I had good experience in that internship so I just wanna help my other friends jasle chai sachikkai tyo drive xa and believe to start career here as toxic companies ko list lamai xa.  Common questions hola so comment if you wana learn more and instead of DMs (hate that gatekeeping ) I would answer those here.",

Here’s my story:  * Finished high school in 2016 with a focus on management. * Worked in tech support for a while, then did a 2 years of IT training (focused in Network and Cybersecurity) from India * After that, I worked as a Network Engineer at TCS (in India) * In 2022, I switched the field and became a Security Analyst (worked in Oracle) * Now, I’m freelancing as a Security Analyst for APAC and EMEA regions and doing well financially.  So here's the dilemma: I’m wondering if I should still go back and get a Bachelor's degree, it feels that not having a degree is dragging me behind or if my current work experience and skills are enough to keep growing in my career.

Malai taw interview onsite hunxa ki vanera tension parethyo as mero clz rw tyo office alli tada xa but then got to know that interview was done through google meet.  And I joined the call Hr was on time (well already a green flag for me ) and then another senior was also on the call.  After basic convo the senior dai asked me uestion about my project. Interesting was I didnt do project on React but they didnt care becayse they say that for joining that internship you need to have drive than just knowldege of 100+ languages.  And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.  And the final question I asked why its called bootcamp but not internship ans they say internship vanyp vane final year ko matra auxan but this is for anyone interested wether its just student who crossed 12 or passed masters.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

But the very reason eating beef is prohibited because it is against so called 'hindu' norms.  During the Rig Vedic period, beef was a diet. After the 'puran yug', so many new dieties were created like Narayan and Laxmi. And thus eating cows became a taboo.   But a law is a law. Laws need to change too as per the dynamics of society. If you don't change the law, people will always create chaos over such things.  Regarding this and other so called 'hindu' values, we khas people and Hindusized Kirati are far liberal. It is a very disturbing fact that even them people can't comprehend that 'Hindu'  values were imported from modern day North India.  'Hinduism' is not the de facto religion of Nepal, mainly the hilly and mountainous region. But in the Terai region that adjoins with Bihar and surrounding provinces, 'hindu' values are very deep rooted in their genes. It will be almost impossible to get them behave in different ways.  This issue is a serious one. Rai, Limbu and other Kirati tribes want to eat beef. It is not that they are not eating already. But they want it to be legal.  But the 'hindus' whose ancestry goes back to modern day North India and those khas people who think 'hinduism' was always their roots find it very hard to digest.   If you understand the root of the problem,  solution is easy.   If it was up to me, I would change the law leaving it to be individual or provincial freedom. Tolerance need to be practiced. No 'hindu' will be forced to eat beef or witness the killing or trade. But no non-hindu should be prohibited from eating it.  I'd advise my 'hindu' friend that they learn history beyond puran ages. And again, I request them to understand Nepal is not as very much 'hindu' as as India. Our ruling class adopted 'hinduism' so the common people were forced to follow 'hinduism'.  I also request them to understand that they do not always have the final or decisive say because we are not a Hindu kingdom anymore and there is no hindu king to enforce the law strictly.  Disowing those who raise question is very bad practice. They are as Nepali as anybody can be and in their mind they are fighting to preserve their long held values.|||Extremist area ma estai ho.

At first, I thought some theif robbed the house but when I asked a uncle about it, he said a girl of my age (19) did suicide.  I heard some aunties saying \"koi kta le xodyo vandaima suicide garna hunthena, pariwar aama buwa vanda mathi koi kta kasari huna sakxa\". So the reason could be due to breakup but I just came back home because it didn't have anything to do with me. Although my mom is there right now, I will update if the reason for suicide is anything else or how it is being handled. Rest in peace girl😔  Update: My mom came back - So the reason is still uncleared, mom said that girl was from village area who came here to study bachelor but she wasn't able to study for bachelor. She was in a room and in another room there lived a female friend of her, today morning when her friend knock her room door she didn't answer so she sneak from the window and saw that she was hanging in fan.",

I hope she rests in peace.|||Ofc people’s first guess is heartbreak. That is the first rumor people spread when they find out a girl took her life. As if women have nothing else going on in their lives.|||Absolutely gut wrenching news, that poor girl had her whole life ahead of her. May her soul rest in peace🕊️|||The amount of commenters worried about rent is insane. Someone died but sorry for your inconvenience. There are deeper mental issues than breakups going on in someone’s life.  An yes of course the aunties first assumption will always be whether she was having an affair with someone, because that’s how their gossips start, assuming the worst possible accusation against someone who just died.   Rest in peace 🪦|||Rent ma suicide hanya?|||Thats horrible I just woke up man 😔|||This is sad.  Valley vitrai ho?|||I’m sorry to hear that. The breakup might not even be the real cause, but just a rumor people create to justify what they cannot understand.  In Nepal, mental health awareness is still so rare. People often fail to see that behind someone’s smile, there might be silent battles, unhealed wounds, and unseen pain.  Our parents believe that paying school fees, buying clothes, giving pocket money, and providing food and comfort is enough. Yet they forget the most precious thing: time, presence, and the warmth of genuine understanding.  So many children and young people hesitate to speak about their struggles, not because they don’t want to, but because they were never truly heard. And it’s not their parents’ fault entirely, because their own voices were once silenced, leaving them unsure how to listen with compassion.  As one philosopher said, “Suicide is not just an act of ending one’s life; it is a quiet murder committed by society, a society that failed to understand the weight an individual carried alone.”|||May she rest in peace, padhai future kei ko pressure thyo hola. muji auntieharu le chei manxe marda ni ke ke assume garnu parne.|||I hope you're fine. you must be very disturbed with the incident|||CEE Deko ta Haina ne hijo?|||Can u pls tell me which area?|||Rest in peace|||These gaule aunties just assume things and come to conclusion you should ignore them|||thats so sad man|||Now people will judge her, Lol.

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||No offense but submissive girls are cute|||Khoi k ho k ho on 1 side you get normal girls who you talk and see ra aba tyo sites haru ma ra prostitute garni haru , are they the same ki euta invisible line xa we can't see to differentiate idk....|||widebody    bhutanese refuge   etc etc yestai haina?",

            "body": "My (ex) friend let's say “**Shakiraaaa**” was the one who actually did it.  She was 26, living alone in a tiny 1BHK in Baneshwor. The ceiling leaked, and her landlord would bang on the door every 1st of the month asking for 15k rent. Her salary was 22k after tax.  One month, her brother’s remittance from Qatar got delayed. Dashain expenses had already drained her savings, and the landlord threatened to change the lock.  Scrolling Instagram one night, she found a Dubai-based account DMing random Nepali girls:  >***“Clean feet, good arches, 500 AED per set.”***  That’s around 19,000 NPR for 10 photos. No face. No name. Just soles on a white bedsheet.  She laughed at first. Then opened eSewa and saw the balance: Rs. 1,500.  The next evening, she went to Bhatbhateni, bought a Rs. 400 white bedsheet, painted her nails red (the guy’s request), locked her door, and took 15 photos on burst mode. She sent the best 10 through Telegram.  Money transferred in 10–20 minutes. She paid her rent, bought groceries, and treated herself to a Rs. 300 coffee like nothing had happened.  We stopped being friends a month later, not because I judged her hustle, but because she started scaling it. She began coaching other 1-2 girls from of her friends circle and took a 20 percent cut as their manager. Last I heard, she had stopped doing it, got married, and moved out of Nepal.  The funniest part, she actually suggested I do a pedicure and make my feet look good like a girl because, apparently, my white feet would sell. I just laughed and stayed out of it. 😑🥲  But, the worst thing she did was turn survival into a startup for few months.  Okay, now I’m curious. What’s the wildest thing you’ve seen someone do for cash?",

What changed is a new court interpretation that looks more at who paid for what and whose name the property’s under.  In short they are approaching it in a more nuanced way.It’s gender-neutral and still considers years of marriage, kids and even non financial contributions but it’s not some blanket rule like “wife gets nothing”. Basically, it’s about clearer proof, not banning claims. Stop oversimplifying laws and for once, read past the headline before running with it.   And btw, alimony is a gender-neutral term it’s not solely “for women.” The reason most recipients are women is because many are still financially tied to their husbands. If the husband earns less than the wife, the court can absolutely order her to pay alimony instead.|||https://preview.redd.it/djl1pbukrczf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d953bd1827a3a6fbe3e523a22994eca84b54a572  [https://www.quora.com/China-executes-white-collar-criminals-Has-this-proven-to-be-a-great-deterrent-from-crime-in-general](https://www.quora.com/China-executes-white-collar-criminals-Has-this-proven-to-be-a-great-deterrent-from-crime-in-general)  Nepal ma yo chai garnai parcha.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

Being an intern at Web Studio Nepal i found every team member are frustrated on work because of not getting salary for long period of time. Everyone contribute our 100% and not get paid and most of us left jobs there. Still the company doesn’t care about you and ignore the messages. Don’t hire if you don’t want to paid someone family is waiting and someone is building their future. #unpaidintern #frustatedemployee",

Everyone was told not to mix, so families did the matchmaking. Also, Nepal actually has more women than men, so statistically it’s not a supply issue, even without arranged marriages, people will still get married because, well, people are gonna to get married.|||Our society is weird on relationships and all. I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

Life is hard and difficult everywhere not just abroad .  “You will be judged by how useful,capable,disciplined you are” “Read and learn everyday” bro chill it’s literally not that dramatic.

If you ask anybody who’s moved from outside Kathmandu (especially rural areas) to Kathmandu, they will let you tell almost a similar version to what you said.|||So basically it's the same as in homecountry. I don't understand why people think life is only hard abroad. Bro you choose you choose to go abroad. So earn your choice and yes survival is hard everywhere.|||As an older Canadian brother -  I have housed 3 Nepali guys.   Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol. Like mental toughness is something one can just learn. It comes with experience, dealing with hardships. It's not something you can just build at home. \"Read and learn every single day\" LOL.   Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||J pani overdramatic banauna parni hau Nepali harulai..

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted. TLDR: rpeating years, doesn't equal to same amount of preparations every year. Some years are good, some are not.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||Bhik me kuch dedo humko bhaisahab|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

And the army doesn't have all the blame to take. Lord knows what security council was busy in. What purpose does a security council serve if it cannot hold a meeting in emergency. Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:** If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from [Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.   Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:** The Reddit user can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:** NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:** They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code `*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#` to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:** For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:** The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:** The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.   Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:** Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:** The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves. |||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..😝|||At this point, I’ve accepted there’s no way to get a refund.

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder.

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.

Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

Many talented individuals are even losing jobs and opportunities simply because there’s no reliable way to get paid for their work.

Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

You don’t want to make fun of someone without evidence, period. Whatever Sandeep has done regarding such youtube content is very right. The cheap YouTube channel should be banned.|||OP youre a fucking pig, i know for a fact you're a paradygm employee being paid a measly salary they can afford writing this to try to defame him even further lmao, its his fault that he got defamed and now its \"victim\" mindset to ask for compensation and closure?   When a whore and a group of manipulators ruined all his effort, talent and the career he had built for himself?   fuck off. Your post is gpt generated garbage, with no human critique or elements be a man, be a human instead of a corporate slave being paid next to nothing.|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women.

These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023.

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!! Pic 7 year ago this day.  My last bhai tika.",

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples. If one has core understanding of the subject and knows how to manage time with good handwriting, it isnt difficult to score 70+. You will need to be consistent though.|||Maile ni 2 barsa almost every exam ma 85 katako ho tei pani 2L jati ta tirnai paryo so its kinda hard tara ali mehenat garyo bhane chai sakchau easily 85% just math lastai dami banaunu paryo ani aru ma decent bhayepani katcha|||Hello u/Technical_Cat6948, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",
