Lenin would burn them all if he sees how Nepali Communists are.|||The Maoists party in Nepal just uses Communism as an aesthetic while they sell all the nation's resources to the oligarchs. Also Communism is not when \"both die of hunger\"  it's, nobody should die of hunger while some eat in silver plated food.|||Communist as the party or ideology?    Even China is not true communist.|||Would you like two people make same income and live in a happy community or would you prefer income inequality causing chaos, widspread unhappiness, rampant greed, and ultimately poor people killing rich?

Stop arguing under it about my statement, because what I said is obviously stupid and the obvious reason is to tell OP that his question is equally stupid.|||We both die of hunger. But the problem isn't as simple as that dumfk these people work alongside the government to make projects easier, corruption money funneled into their business, influencing policies and supporting polticial parties for their agenda while exploiting the people.

Many think calling themselves communist is cool, philosophical, and a stand for equality, but the truth is that communism has only ever lived in theories, never in real practice. Every so-called communist state eventually turned authoritarian or adapted to markets, and today the entire world has moved toward mixed economies—a balance of capitalism for growth and socialism for welfare. What sounds ideal in books is far from reality, and understanding this early saves a lot of misplaced idealism.|||The only true communist you speak of is china who has successfully implemented its concept( although there is still corruption they neutralise it instantly if found guilty unlike our country)Rest country who has adopted it has just formulated it in surface to show illusions in the eye of dumbass public like us in nepal. The no of millionaire in nepal suggest if they have become millionaire in legit manner or by 3rd ways. Yes become rich i dont mind but if you buy crores of property even though you have just stepped into financial field itself is a red flag. Nobody can generate that much profit in mere 1- 2 years.

Exactly  To answer your question in your scenario the rich ones earning 50 crores would cause me and others to die of hunger|||Communist is not about no one being rich…   It’s about everyone being rich.|||I'm a pro capitalist myself, but here's my take on why this is the case in Nepal (copied from another post of mine):  You see the problem with rich in the context of Nepal (and any underdeveloped nation) is that being filthy rich out of nowhere is almost always impossible. This is because in an underdeveloped economy, there isn't much consumer needs that you can solve which creates more value which makes you rich. The economy and society isn't sophisticated enough.  So, most of the rich people you see are mostly old money folks who were close to the monarchy, who got rich from the new political system, and that compounded with them owning land in the most important parts of the country.  Now, a select few being able to magically earn more (due to the land value appreciation) sitting idle while rest of the country has to work hard to earn some fraction of that is unfair, irrational, and unsustainable from a system design perspective.  This is contrary to what happens in a developed nation like America, where anyone can go and establish a billion dollar business by figuring out an emerging need and solving for it in the mesh of that sophisticated and good spending society.|||https://preview.redd.it/zaoba8alb8qf1.jpeg?width=181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35e8a49d3d78520777e381ad26f7b63987c363b4|||The idea of individualism and indiviluistic freedom is something that won't allow Communism to fluorish.  A lot of today's problem - that we see in our society - communism would solve it. But in paper, communism needs a way and mechanism for functioning properly and in transparent manner.  I'm against Communism - as I believe Socialism could be a potential solution. But you need to bound by heavy patriotism feeling for this to happen - and I don't think that is feasible for a lifetime of a human when other options provide better lifestyles.|||Capitalism gives intensive to hard work and innovation. In India the manufacturing industry was working on Socialist models as there were many government owned companies which had Monopoly that's why it never prospered.  But the Service sector contributes to 55% of GDP which works as an \"open market principle\" because there is no Government company or strict regulation.  Communist ideology looks good in theory but nature itself is capitalist, even ants collect their food before rain, and whoever will work hard will collect more.  The government's job should be only to create a level playing field (equal opportunity for all). This can be done by giving free education, healthcare etc.   India too was struggling with growth rate of only 3.5% till year 1991. And then we shifted towards capitalistic (open market model).|||Communists are made for keeping the poor people and the poor. If the poor become rich, their voter turnout declines. That's why they keep on people as it is. It's a failure principle not applicable anywhere now. They will be shipped out very soon from Nepal.|||Communism only works on paper.",

But when I talk to them, many don’t sound happy they’re working nonstop just to survive and cover tuition fees.  I chose differently. I stayed in Nepal. Since Class 12, I’ve been financially independent. I invested in NEPSE, paid for my own bachelor’s admission, and worked full-time (40 hrs/week) while balancing a day college schedule. It was tough, but manageable. Whenever I felt burned out, I’d take a break and go trekking or visit lakes with friends.  Now I’m in my final year, working remotely for a US company with good pay, and planning to launch my own startup soon. Looking back, I don’t regret my decision at all. Unless I’m forced to leave, I don’t see myself going abroad.  **My question is:** For those of you who did go abroad or decided to stay how do you feel about your decision now? Is going abroad worth all the hype?",

I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content. But I miss being in Nepal more than anything.|||Nepal is a small landlocked country. The culture and people are nice but you will always be pigeonholed here.

In Nepal, payments that you receive are deducted at source, meaning the payer or employer is liable for deducting tax and depositing the amount to the respective ird on behalf of her.  So what she received  must have been gross pay minus 15% = net pay, her take home amount.  Because she has multiple sources of income, all employers would have deducted 15% and paid her the amount.  Some companies or brands, however, bind you in contract and spread the single payment in a smaller amount paid in a longer period like monthly salary. This way, the tax amount would have been different.   But, given that employers are responsible for the tax deduction at source (TDS), it is assumed paid.|||Tyo Shrinkhala bichara bakra matra banni raxe.

There is nothing anyone could do because of the constitution for the old leaders to try again.   But this time, if we play our cards right, next election ma voter Id card banayera we need to vote for the party/person who we think can bring a change.  Change doesn’t happen overnight, we need to be patient.  Either start doing politics by yourself, or support someone who does. That’s the only thing our constitution allows.|||Lol, things never chang overnight. Expecting these corrupt people to just give up their power and privilege is not that easy. They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal. Unless we convict then for crime in court they are free to start doing that.  Let's keep being vigilant. Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".   What the jenji protest has done is create eye opening moment for a lot of the old generation people and has made the younger generation a major stakeholder in the country's governance and politics.

America is still fighting to establish a democracy almost 250 years after it started.  Come election time, find and support candidates that reflect the GenZ values. Grill them with a questionnaire and debates to make sure they have the right views. Hold endorsement meetings where they have to defend their policies.  Most importantly organize a strong get out the vote program to ensure that those with the most to loose have their voice hear.|||I was born and raised in Nepal until my teenage years before moving to the United States, and it has been over four decades since then. Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas—warriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn’t even facing him. That wasn’t bravery—it was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed—hundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of “justice”—wasn’t justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn’t stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power—the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces—bear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation—if this is the standard of “justice” that today’s youth believe in—then Nepal’s future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||you guys wanted monarchy?????????",

Transport situation are as usual, no price increase, network is fine and you should have coverage in majority of the areas, wifi is also available in almost every hotel|||I’m not from Nepal but have been for an extended period. I would feel comfortable going right now. Best long transport would be buses or shared vans. It’s possible the schedules are a bit disrupted right now, and I would just recommend asking your overnight accommodation for their recommendation. To travel within places like Kathmandu valley or Pokhara, the best transportation is InDrive. You can trek the Annapurna region solo, just make sure you get the ACAP permit from the ACAP office in either Kathmandu or Pokhara. Cellular connection isn’t so bad when you’re in populated areas. Occasionally on bus routes, you may have limited connection. Connection will be poor or nonexistent on many parts of any trek including in the Annapurna region, however it reached further than I expected. You can also expect overnight trekking accommodations to offer WiFi for an additional charge.|||Its generally safe , but do stay alert and updated and avoid big crowds if you can.|||Btw if you are in US and in H1B status read the new executive order before deciding to leave the country. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/|||Nepal is really safe for travelling but come here next year. The political surrounding is not stable rightnow. I don't want tourists to feel that political tension.|||Its safe. And was always safe. Even for corrupt politicians its safe, why bother when you are traveller. Even safe if you are a tourist.   Transportation works always. If it halts for few days, the transport employees would suffer.  Its festival time so transportation will be irregular as people will be travelling. But will be available.|||Nepal is truly safe. All is going well as always...|||Yes, you can still travel to Nepal. The Gen Z protests made things unstable for a while, but a new government has already formed and the situation is calming down. Daily life in Kathmandu and Pokhara is getting back to normal, though it’s smart to check updates with your trekking company before you move around.  Transport is running again. Flights and buses to places like Pokhara and Besisahar are working, but expect some delays here and there. Prices of food and hotels have not gone up much from the protests, only small changes in some areas. For trekking the Annapurna Circuit, you can go solo right now. The trails are open, teahouses are running, and trekkers are already back on the route.  Network is fine in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and most towns. Once you leave Chame and go higher toward Manang and Thorong La, the connection is weak or gone. After crossing the pass, Jomsom has decent network again. Between villages you should expect no signal in a few long stretches.  So yes, it is safe, just travel smart and check updates locally when you land.|||Yes|||No. 15000 prisoners escaped and only 5000 have been found or arrested. 10,000 inmates are still missing.|||Given the current situation, I would recommend rescheduling your trip.",

Keep reminding everyone what we're fighting for.  Some recommendations:  * financial audit and public reporting of everyone who's elected to a position of power and their immediate relations. This should be done periodically for a period that's longer than they're actually in the position of power. An extreme example would be up to the age of 65 if people can be involved till 55. This report should be made available to the akhtiyar at all times. A simple net worth figure and a list of their investments should be available to general public. * for elected folks, document every issue that they're taking a stand on and what work is being done.

On the other hand, a directly elected President is a better option because this system clearly separates powers.

Nepal needs technology (hardware) that is cheap and reliable enough to be used by farrmers. Imported technology, imported food, imported clothes are making Nepal poor. Go and study what is the most imported items in Nepal, exclude the imports that ate imported just to be exported,(eg supari).  Nepal has perhaps the best  Tangerines/Mandarin in the world, yet we have not exploited it. Why! Because no scale. Our own suntala hardly suffices 3 months demand, rest of the 9 month, its import. Where are proper cold stores and cold chain logistics. Importing evey thing makes most of the output expensive. Weakening of rupee rubs the wounds.|||Def not chiya pasal.|||Nepal may need many things, but that need doesn't emerge visibly until the average has a good spending power. Probably the need right now is outright survival and physical safety.   So the lens from which one should be thinking right now (esp. government) is how do we export software based businesses from Nepal that can be consumed by the world. So that it could bring money home and that would increase the spending power for those needs to emerge.       An example is an Astrology app catered for the spirituals of the west. Or a yoga centered app that sells the spiritual aspect of Nepal. Selling the uniqueness of Nepal to the world by mixing it with software.  Right now, we're doing the opposite, we're just importing the needs from the west. Who knew Matcha and Boba were the needs of Nepali folks.|||Solar.

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help speay fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly. Make community run 3D printers (like a library, a public property for an entire community) a common sight in Nepal rather than just a strange novelty technology.

            "comments": "Well, the thing about masters in these top universities (which is not research backed) is it's mostly a cash cow program (yes, even the top unis). I had an interview with a prof from one of the colleges and they said I should first go for the masters (which I promptly denied). Most US universities have funding shortages right now so your chance of scholarship for the masters competing for the limited positions for the international is really competitive. Do you have a paper published in the top journals like the ICLR, NeurIPS or whatever in your respective fields? Similarly, I came to know that the most important part of the application for the graduate schools is the recommendation letters from your professors, now considering the amount of profs in Nepal are dime a dozen and even few internationally known, I would say you would have a very low chance of actually competing against Indians, Chinese, Koreans, and Iranians. It, however, is not impossible and right research match is important.  I would emphasize you to get more experience (research side) or be ready to pay a lot of money to these uni if you really want in which in my opinion is fair enough if you got the capital.|||Research experience is everything for a application of graduate program. |||It matters on your academic scores, research work and overall experience. Getting to top universities would be really tough as acceptance rate is really low and people all across the world would be competing for admissions.  There are very limited funding opportunities in top schools so you will also need good amount of financial backup.  My suggestion would be prepare for IELTS and GRE. Gather some experience and work on research projects. Don't just focus on top unis only. Apply for your dream unis and some mid tiers too.  Getting assistantship/funding is more important to get the visa approvals too|||i can very relate with your situation. i've done my schooling in india and wanted to go abroad for bachelor's, but family didn't want to. so i was just enrolled in a local college in the city.  with all this, i already knew i didn't want to study further, rather earn a lot fast and study abroad with my own money etc. started doing internships, freelance in content, design, and marketing. currently making decent money, got a full-time job before passing out, and im hopeful towards my study abroad dream.  give time to yourself and explore what you like - tech, non-tech, data, etc. and just show up to any opportunity possible. i found my best fit working in web3/blockchain domain.  not sure if this helps but yeah just putting out there.",

            "heading": "I was tired of Bullshit SEO advices so I built a tool that helped me ranked on google in 3 weeks",
            "body": "Context: Back in 2023, I jumped into this \"SEO\" thing for my startup because I thought, “hey, this can’t be that hard.” I just have to write some good blogs, add a few \"targeted keywords\" in the content, send emails to few prospect for \"link building\" and then BOOM Google will show my site in the first page.  Nope. Not even close.  I spent months publishing content (more than 20+ articles) I thought they were amazing. But when I checked Google? Page 10. Page 12. Basically invisible. And every time I tried to ask “why isn’t this ranking?” most answer I got from SEO gurus was mostly the same two words:  “Your Content is good, but SEO TAKES TIME\"  And then, of course, the golden advice: “Just build quality backlinks.”  Okay… but what does that actually mean?  How many backlinks do I need?  \"SEO TAKES TIME\" okay, but exactly how long specifically for my target \"keyword\" I want to rank for?  And getting backlinks from what kind of sites is good enough to be considered as \"high quality backlinks\" purely for my targeted keyword?  And how the hell do I guest post without spamming “keyword + write for us” into Google and begging random sites for guest posts?  That’s when it hit me: what if there was a tool that didn’t just say “build quality backlinks,” but literally broke it down for you? Like Google saying  “To rank for this keyword, you’ll need around 42 backlinks from DA 28-32 sites, you site MUST LOAD under 2.5 seconds, have 3 supporting articles, and ~4 months of consistency. Oh, and here’s the exact strategy to actually get those backlinks without generic guest posting BS.”  So… I built it.  It’s called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com). It’s a tool where you type in your target keyword (for example: “best AI tools in 2025”), and it tells you:  How many backlinks you’ll realistically need  What domain authority range those backlinks should come from  How long it’ll probably take to rank  What technical fixes you need to make  And most importantly → the strategy to actually hit those requirements  I’m not saying this magically gets you to Page 1 overnight (SEO is still work). But at least now you can start with clarity instead of guesswork with Pikera SEO.  Right now, Pikera SEO is in early access, and we’re running a waitlist here: https://pikeraai.com/waitlist.  If you’re a founder, marketer, or just someone tired of SEO “it depends” answers, I think you’ll find it useful.  But I’d also love your feedback: if you were using a tool like this, what’s the #1 thing you’d want it to tell you about your keyword? Because I’m still improving it, and honestly, hearing from people in communities like this is way more valuable than any \"SEO guru’s\" advice.  That’s it. Just wanted to share my journey, my frustration, and what I built out of necessity.  If anyone’s been through the same SEO pain, I’d love to hear your story too.",

This way parties would focus more on stability because their leaders would have limited chances to hold these top roles and would try to make the most of their time in office.  At the same time making sure that all institutions stay fully independent would stop political interference and build stronger checks and balances.

I don’t hate him as person or anything to do with it but  I can  you you can’t trust him with country|||A potential leader of a country has to have many characteristics, so I can't just agree or dismiss \"Rabi\" or any person is the \"best leader\". Just as I am running my thoughts over this matter. Some characteristics I would like in a leader of  my country.   1. Genuine interest to serve the country without a motive for just personal gain.   2. A good diplomat, negotiator with ability to stay calm in adverse circumstances.   3. Personal intelligence, ability to understand problem and propose solutions to them.   ... so on         I think what general public feel is that he would try to genuinely serve the country. He would try to speak the voice of voiceless, that's how he got majority of his admirers through this tv program with this persona. I tend to agree with this. I would expect him to genuinely try to do good. And RSP would at least be an alternative to demonstrably corrupt leaders and party structures of the three musical chair players. That works for his merit I think.         But I have very strong doubts about 2. and 3. I mentioned above. He always appears to be angry at something and most(all?) of his his addresses  are high octane anger filled expressions. I very much doubt that he would be able to manage a lot of adversaries and provide a calm leadership. This requires personal characteristic of being calm and on top of that requires intelligence as well. I have more serious doubt about his intelligence.     सहकारी case is a bit of an absurdity it seems. I tend to believe that the major parties UML and Congress were trying to weaken him with this behaviour of keeping him behind bars and not letting him fight his case from outside. Especially because he became major political player in a very sort time threatening the establishment. But I also don't believe he is clean. All of them courts can't conspire simultaneously against one single individual as many people may believe. If our stance against corruption and misuse of power and \"crime\" is that of \"zero tolerance\" शून्य सहनशीलता,  then we can't just let him off the hook. He has to go through all of this and clean his name if he genuinely is innocent as he claims to be.  If he was genuinely clean, he would have remained calm. Him trying to cash in the protest sentiment by waving his arms (even sneaking his head out of sunroof of car?) with allegedly fake  documents (the language of which was very seriously suspicious) tells he is also some sort of attention seeker if it was not already clear.|||Genz jey bhayeh ni party ko mindset bhako family ko santati ho ni ta.

Attention within the Nepali Congress–CPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner.  >With Congress obtaining the governor’s post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party.  >Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor. In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday.  >Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner.  >Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant.  >The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.   >  >|||Politician be like \"Dam I tell you it was all AI\"  ![gif](giphy|p8Uw3hzdAE2dO)",

Many students do this alongside studies. Also, there are free resources online (YouTube, Khan Academy, NMC prep channels) that can help you push your score higher without paying for classes. Even I worked as a part time waiter after my SEE and I was working plus studying +2 to make some extra cash to support my family.. No job is small or big, try to work wherever you can for some extra cash.. start seeking for job, go to nearest restaurants, coffee shops, other businesses, someone would definitely be hiring..  If scholarship doesn’t work out this year, remember MBBS is not the only path, Loksewa and many other options can still give you a secure future. But for now, your priority should be your safety and health. Please reach out to a close friend, a teacher, or even counseling services if you ever feel like giving up. You don’t deserve to carry this pain alone.  You’ve already proved you have the talent and resilience, just keep going step by step. Things can change and will definitely change|||trust yourself, 130 aairaxa vane it's already great. ek choti dashain namanauda kei hudaina. 1.5 pani haina ajhai less xa din haru, ik aba sabai ignore garera padha vannu matra sajilo xa but think wisely timi sadhai mami ko gaali ra kutai khane ani sano tino kaam garera life kataune ki few more days endure garera marks increase garna ma dhyan dine  end of the choice is yours, goodluck!!|||Not to demotivate you bahini, but I think Loksewa is the best option for you now.

Sometimes we just have to accept the situation, ghati herera had nilnu bhaneko jastai. Right now your focus needs to be on finding a job and probably a roommate that you can share your rent expenses with. And just cut off all the contacts with your mother asap. She has mental issues probably bipolar or something, it's not your job to fix it. She brought you into this mess and it was her responsibility to take care of you, not yours to take care of her. So just cut off all the contacts and find a job.

MBBS is a long and tough journey and requires a good support system from your family for at least 6 years if you do well. And trust me it is not as lucrative as it seems from outside. A lot of your youth and family money goes into it even in scholarship. From my perspective, It's better for you to do some income earning work and take your study side by side( which is not possible in MBBS ,kapal njharunjel dedicated vayera padnu parcha to be a doctor).

MBBS is a really hectic field and it’s not like you imagine it to be. Aile timro financial condition herda, it’s better if you try for Loksewa, as you’ll get results and earn money way faster than MBBS. MBBS takes at least 4 and a half years , teti bela samma you won’t even earn a penny. You’ll start to earn a bit of money during internship as a stipend.  Also, the mental pressure in these 4 and a half years is too much. Endless classes, practicals, weekly exams sabai le stress dincha. If you’re thinking of taking tuition classes or doing a side job, then it’s really hard to do so for straight 4 and a half years.  Unless someone else is helping you out financially, it’s really hard. Ki ta timile IOM ma naam nikalnu parcha, natra it’s quite hard without any financial support.  It’s your future, so make the decision wisely. I'm always rooting for you!

Unless you solely want to dedicate you life to serve, MBBS is a poor financial decision. Even government college and scholarships charge some money. Its 5 and half y of very harsh and stressful study and you seems to be already on so much stress. Financially she can do a better job even taking tuition class. Join any cheap bachelor degree and graduate. Education is not equal to financially gain. It just give you basic qualification. If you are smart and hard working, rather working in any shop as saleswoman can give her more knowledge and skill about bussiness.  MBBS is not what it used to be in Nepal. Most fresh graduate are depressed themselve due to current situation. They had to do a month long protest to get a basic salary of 45 k for a job where they have to work 36 straight hour( literally). MBBS is just beginning then comes MD and DM which takes 6 more year and you might think then the earns in lakh. Wrong. Still salary is 65-80 k in valley. If u put so much effort and energy in a chiya pasal, your chances of becoming richer  is more. If you have passion for job and dont care for money, then sure its a nobel job. But lets be realistic everyone wants a good life. So dont need to be so desperate for a MBBS seat   Please think outside of box for a second  You life is more precious than thousands of MBBS seat. Take a year. Do small shift jobs while you are figuring. Think of a subject that you will be happier in long. Even if you get into MBBS somehow, you will regret it later.|||Not to discourage  you but MBBS is tough, stressful and long journey. Your other option of lok sewa sounds much better. Even if you start with lower rank, you can study while  in service and appear in tests for higher ranks like officer down the road. I think being a public servant might give you more confidence,  improve relationship with your mother and give you social support and network,  which are critical for your mental health. I can understand that route is also not easy or guaranteed .  I dont know how actively government is recruiting and how frequently lok sewa runs tests, and your chances  of succeeding on those test.  I live abroad, I can contribute few hundred dollars to support you, but it's tricky to confirm the authenticity of posts in reddit.

Ali lamo cha story, just heres but here is my story. (dherai lamo cha so 3 parts ma divide gareko chu due to reddit comment limit)  Ma ni +2 sidde pachi MBBS prep gareko thie but after going to premed in NAME, i realised its too competative and I wasn't sure about myself. Tes pachi maile bahira jana soch gare. Ghar ma ni Mom, Dad le last malai MBBS ma force garthe. +2 ma ramro student vaera hola, they expected a lot from me. Tyo pressure le garda, malai ghar ma ni dherai basna mathiena so maile US tira apply gare. US ma maile mechanical engineering ko lagi apply gare and I got VISA and everything and I landed in US on 2017. Now this decision is something that haunts me and my family till this date.  I was born in a poor family - I remember sano huda autai kotha ma kitchen, living room, bedroom hunthyo. My family could not even afford meat back then and we would always get discriminated by own family relatives (british army ko family) . Fortunately after taking lots of loan and networking, my dad got a work visa for south korea. So after that my family invested in business and growing up since then, I was growing up with lots of luxury. I was a rich kid (testo flex ta kai gardina thie, tara never had to worry about money to buy things). Jaba ma US ma ako thie, till then we still were financially good so, khasai testo tension thiena.  But something happened with our business around 2018, and one after another our business started taking hits. Suru suru ma tha ali hickup matra jasto lagthio but our business literally started going on -ve. Aba feri ma US ma ali mango college ma padthie. Mero tuition comes to about $15,000 to $18,000 per semester (US dollar). That's a lot of money. Feri ma bahira ni kam gardina thie. My family all of a sudden got into lot of pressure. Nepal ma ni finance bijog vaisakeko thio, aba US ma paisa pathauna ni milena. Ghar ma raat din mero dad ra mom ko jhagada hunthyo. ( btw my mom was the one who operated business in my house hold - dad retired after coming back from Korea). Esto awostha ma mero mom ni panick vaera started gambling and made bad decissions - huge reward, high risk type, US ma nai tuition pathauna she started taking loans like lot of loans - kunai through person, kunai through banks. Till now remember, we had credible business and assets so we had a credible history, tey vaera people and banks were giving loan to us. Ata mero mental health ni decline vairathio. I grew up in comfort, testo gharo chiz maile k gareko thiena till then, esto pressure maile kahile ni experience gareko thiena. All of a sudden esto huda, I started getting depressed and became reclusive. Tespachi my dad broke a news that we where 10-15 crores in debt. Aba tyo vanda, ma jhan panick vae. Aba ata US ma mero relative ni koi chaina, esto kura sathi haru saga ni kahile share garina - because I am embarassed. Tes pachi ata uta garera maile sathi haru saga loan liera, ata US ma sano online business garchu vanera online store khole. Unfortunately tyo ni loss ma gayo. My GF at that time (mero ex), maile u saga loan lie, and i maxed out all my credit card and went all in to open another online business - coffee mugs (collector items). Mero saman chai sab china bata sip hunthyo. Asma chai mero sales hunthyo tara testo profitable thiena. Store naya nai thio, but unfortunately COVID happened. Tes pachi within weeks I couldn't fulfil any shipments and in few weeks, i had to close down. By the end, I was roughly $15000 in debt (US ma). Tespachi I was full on sucidal mode. Malai sucide bahek kai soch audaina thio. I knew ma saga crores ko debt cha. I realised my parents may not be able to pay it off. I realized all of our assets might be taken away in future. Jhan tyo mathi, mero mom lie aba bank haru le black list ni gardio because, we couldn't pay loans back. After that it was just a downhill. My mom sold majority of her assets for me rather than paying the loan cuz she did not want me to be illegal or get kicked out of school. Which when i look back, was a real bad decission. I wish she had paid of high interest debt. Tyo time ma malai sadai mero University ko tall building bata ham falna man lagthio. Tara i was scared ki that building was not tall enough for me to kill -  5-6talla. If i survived i would just be paralyzed. Teti bela mero ex le emotional support dinthyo, so i did not give into my impulsive thoughts to end my life - hindsight 20/20, I am thankful for that.

People think the country is important globally, but this idea distracts from the harsh reality of being poor. Instead of fixing their own issues, people blame foreign powers like the US, India, and China. The main problem is the oppressive system within the country. Scholars are afraid to speak out, and intellectuals focus on pleasing those in power rather than finding real solutions. As a result, the country and people struggle, stuck in a cycle of self-delusion and weakness. The people can't face the truth about their country's situation.|||Finally!!!!!  Someone shares the same thoughts as me. I can't remember the countless discussions I have been in against the ideas like 'US needs Nepal to take check China', 'Nepal is the most important country to look after South Asia'...BS.  These are simply cheap and overhyped nationalist narratives used to win public support, especially when they dont have any other logical argument to back them up.   Also, look at the narrative that Nepal is rich in natural resources. Like which country is not?  Japan considered themselves poor in natural resource, hence focusing on their human resource (technology and innovation) for driving up their economy. And we are poorer than them just in terms of natural resource. But many of us still believe Nepal is the 2nd richest country in water resources.   We are trapped in our own little overhyped delusion. that's why we as a country and the public dont have a clear path to economic development.|||I have a very similar view on this topic. I think people in Nepal are always blaming others for their issue and think they're whats being talked about all the time. Like President Xi, Modi, and Trump all they do is think about how to invade and destabilize Nepal and yet all we do is take donation and do corruption with donation money. We don't have even 10% importance of what people here claim we have. Nobody even knows where Nepal is and while countries like India, China, US and EU would like our policies to be aligned with their self interest, thats for every fuckin country in the world. Countries want to have their self interest and yet we make it all about us!  The real problem and the real shit is happening all from within. Spineless fucks running the country and illiterate people running around after them. Logical people have it very difficult in this country because they're called Bideshi Dalal, Raw Agent, CIA and what not as if they fuckin even know what any of it stands for. Of course they're going to meddle into our politics, they do it everywhere! If we were powerful we would too! But lacking boundaries and self dignity isn't their problem.  We keep blaming others and yet when we get donations for earthquake victims, we steal from people who have lost their homes and have no shelter and cover our cars with it. I saw a this video of remote schools where the kids lunch allowance was also being stolen and kids were fed 1 mutthi chiura! Like imagine the lack of nutrition to that kid and his development and what will lead to the same fucked up grown ups. The biggest enemy is actually inside roaming around us in plain view.   I also don't blame the general population because all the educated people in history, all they've done is used it to suppress people and control people. Chandra Sumsher was a perfect example, studied in Oxford and yet he was one of the cruelest dictator. He knew general population should be educated but nope. Same with the kings. So I'm hopeful in maybe a few generations, we'll slowly get better. It's alot better than it used to be.|||This is really true, haven’t heard Trump utter anything about the situation in Nepal yet. We have a tendency to overestimate our prowess in terms of Nepals geopolitical importance. As you mentioned, economically we are not much of a factor in global trade. Also I don’t believe that the British couldn’t invade Nepal, I think they never  really intended on doing so.|||The West doesn't need us for our resources or riches. The West wants to use us to destabilize India and China and to drive a wedge between them. It's called tying down your adversary, just like NATO is tying down Russia in Ukraine so that it can focus on China. NATO and BRICS are in a collision course, specially after the tariff wars and the recent SCO summit. The reason they ousted Oli was because Oli was cozying up to Xi, Putin and Kim. I'm not defending Oli here. Yes they are corrupt. But corruption was always there. The timing of this movement, the modus operandi is unmistakeable. Until and unless we realise the precarity of our location, we'll keep suffering.  https://preview.redd.it/6j5w0dt1k6qf1.jpeg?width=1146&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=780d941488081e5a5d2247c28e790533001981d3|||Exactly. Occam’s razor theory: when faced with complex questions, the simplest answer is usually the truth. Nobody in the KP cabinet had much thought to the sept 8 protest. It was leaderless and organized by very young people. During the protest violence occurred and order was given to tackle it as was necessary. It turned into a bloodbath. And the government was blindsided by this. By the evening of sept 8, kp’s cabinet was already feeling the unrest. Sept 9 was the public reacting to sept 8 tragedy.  When faced with an uncertain and unpredictable consequence, we turn to villains to blame because it is easier to blame them than to linger in the uncertainty.   The scary truth about the world is that there are no secret societies or powerful people controlling or directing us, its just us and our random acts that lead to random, unpredictable events.|||Sab ko dosh Us rah Indian lai dinu vaneko bato mah chiplida bhagya lai dosh dinu jastai ho.

Across South Asia you can see the same pattern: \t Sri Lanka: After years of Chinese port projects, the U.S. is backing transparency and debt relief programs. When a friendlier government came to power in Colombo in 2022, Washington quickly boosted aid and military training to prevent Sri Lanka from drifting fully into Beijing’s orbit. \t Maldives: A new administration elected in 2018 signed a defense pact with the U.S., limiting Chinese access to ports and giving Washington a security partner in the Indian Ocean’s critical sea lanes. \t Bangladesh: Although Dhaka still does business with Beijing, successive governments cooperating with the U.S. have received huge trade preferences and military training. A counterweight to Chinese infrastructure loans. \tIndia: The world’s biggest democracy is now a key pillar of the U.S. Indo Pacific strategy (Quad, Malabar naval exercises). Washington has poured in technology, defense sales, and diplomatic support since India’s government moved closer to the U.S.  A government in Kathmandu that’s at least neutral or friendly helps the U.S.: \tDeny China’s deeper footprint in the Himalayas (no bases, no intelligence outposts). \tSupport India’s northern security (the U.S. and India are now close security partners). \tBackstop Nepal’s fragile democracy, which fits the U.S. narrative of countering authoritarian influence.|||LOL this comes from an 18 year old. If only this fuchhe knew what’s happening in the world. |||Conspiracy  theory for usa is that they want to destablise the brics but they are too powerful, and so it more practical to destabilise the neighbours. This makes the brics more invested in the local region. And also helps usa enter in to the region with large developmental projects/ imf loans. Projects like mcc makes it easier to monitor chinas influence in the country.  Uprooting chinas influence is another theory. Removing a communist party from power sends a signal.

At the same time, I dont think she should pursue MBBS. Unless you are solely want to dedicate you life to serve, MBBS is a poor financial decision. Even government college and scholarships charge some money. Its 5 and half y of very harsh and stressful study and she seems to be already on so much stress. Financially she can do a better job even taking tuition class. Join any cheap bachelor degree and graduate. Education is not equal to financially gain. It just give you basic qualification. If she is smart and hard working rather working in any shop as saleswoman can give her more knowledge and skill.  MBBS is not what it used to be in Nepal. Most fresh graduate are depressed themselve due to current situation. They had to do a month long protest to get a basic salary of 45 k for a job where they have to work 36 straight hour( literally). MBBS is just beginning then comes MD and DM which takes 6 more year and you might think then the earns in lakh. Wrong. Still salary is 65-80 k in valley. If u put so much effort and energy in a chiya pasal, your chances of becoming richer  is more. If you have passion for job and dont care for money, then sure its a nobel job. But lets be realistic everyone wants a good life. So dont need to be so desperate for a MBBS seat   For that sister.

Despite public outrage and repeated promises, there has been no accountability, no closure, and no identified perpetrator. We cannot allow this case to be forgotten or buried in the past. Every life matters, and no one especially a child deserves to suffer such unimaginable violence. It is deeply troubling that systemic negligence, mishandled evidence, and lack of urgency have left this case unresolved. We must stand together and demand a transparent, thorough investigation. We must hold institutions accountable and ensure that no other family is forced to endure the same pain and silence.  Let us honor Nirmala’s memory not with silence, but with action. She deserves justice. Her family deserves peace. And our society deserves the truth.",

Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems).

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to “explain her silence” and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they’ve become completely blind to reality. I’m making this post and hoping people don’t fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn’t have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that’s the only privilege she’s ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what “average” really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It’s baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn’t have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, “so be it.” That’s her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted “for no reason” and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she’s misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you’ve benefitted from that influence. That’s not defamation. That’s public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself “self-made.” And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You’re born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can’t even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she’s made so much money, and how people apparently can’t handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that’s why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren’t criticizing you because you’re young and successful. They’re angry because you’re trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because “satya ko saath cha.” That’s when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she’s standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being “satya” while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn’t defend herself, then “the rest of the world will write her narrative.” Again, it’s about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn’t clear her image like that’s the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who “didn’t unfollow her” and those who supported her privately. That’s her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician’s daughter might have given her access others don’t have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a “small-town mindset” while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There’s such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn’t even seem to see it.  She even says “ma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola” and tries to sound reflective, but it’s just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being “not enough.” Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That’s not trolling. That’s responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don’t have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That’s not humility. That’s denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that’s “not an achievement,” and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn’t really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn’t count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn’t keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn’t a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don’t fall for victimized narrative. Please don’t.",

We thought she was genuine, we supported her, and that’s the only reason she ever got those PR packages and brand deals. She’s not “self-made”. We handed her those privileges because we thought she’d actually speak for us. Instead, she hides behind her husband and drops a manipulative video like nothing happened. She’s turned the whole thing into a joke and it’s very insulting at this point.|||The I am the most influential person in Nepal and get paid this much but I was never in  power to stop corruption in the same line while probably sitting in the same house funded by corruption, baffling …  Manipulation 101|||Malai laagi rathyo estai huncha.

Sad!   But people should also need to expose other affluent and truly Nepo Kids like the granddaughter of Prachanda, Baburam Ko Chhori, Oli ko god daughter Zelina Karki, Jhalanath ko Snake Farm and countless others  The movement should not be limited to Neta only, Karmachai have long list of corruption charges too  Maybe I should list them in a post so others can look into it.|||It was self pity and delusion through and through.      IOE topper and Harvard grad would've had enough intelligence to read the room.   Excel sheet doesn't even absolve her, it is just proves how fabulously cushy her life was, completely out of touch with Nepali sentiment.   At this point it's fair to assume her corrupt father paid for her academic titles too.|||I knew this was coming ever since Kantipur began putting out news pieces that looked like they were subtly supporting the GenZ protest. Later, Sambhav Shirohiya shared something similar on his instagram story. It was only a matter of time before she threw out some nonsense and put on her crocodile tears. They know exactly how to manipulate us and we get emotional way too quickly.  Our country is run by the idiots for the idiots so be ready to get ruled by same 3 d\\*\\*\\*heads.|||https://preview.redd.it/1cqs8f03d0qf1.jpeg?width=1776&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=413cc01da3d5c52183f54558efa0ab80228da8cb|||Hi, I watched the entire thing, and your analysis is spot on. The lack of self-reflection and the constant logical fallacies, positioning anyone who challenges her as lacking critical thinking, etc, is not lost on us. Her post undermines the intelligence of us Nepalis. It's deeply emotionally manipulative, lacking an understanding of structural power, and shows us that her platform truly didn't stand up for everything it promised.|||Ignoring people like that is the *only* hope. Instead, we should focus on average Joes who have done greater good. Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win. Kudos to your analysis.|||💯. She forgot everything until she was ruined. Then everything came back to her.|||Did not watch the whole video but did she mention about the Nepal Government scholarship that sent her to Harvard? I am more interested to know about that! If not please tell her to make a video about that and how we can also get that!|||Yup, it is. We all saw this coming lol Also, most of us predicted that these so called media personalities for eg MISS Oshin whatever is now turning it around to fit their narrative lmao.  Ik you are on reddit OSHIN. You should seriously stfu|||I kept rolling my eyes all through the video.|||i couldn;t even watch 10 second of that video|||that’s a solid analysis and thanks for posting it. her following has started to recover again lmao. but I am gonna be honest here. I am devastated that her childhood home was burnt down, no one should have to experience that. I sympathize with her on that topic. everything else was a narcissist talking without any accountability. There was a post made by her Harvard classmate here a few days ago which really validates the person she is after seeing her videos today.|||Thats exactly what she did when she fumbled in the evening gown round competition in MW. Takka lighting, angle milaaera, trying to victimise herself and putting all the blame to the designer Manish Rai for adding an extra layer of pearl one day before her departure. Oh my god, it was so pretentious. Tyaa dekhi ho yo keti malai mann napareko. I am glad people are seeing for who she is. But still there are comments that support her.|||Well in all fairness, she was never going to turn around and go “yep, I’m embezzling taxpayer funds”  I think the best thing we can do is leave her in the past, not let her have a voice and not support any brands that endorse her.|||Somebody finally said it so beautifully! I couldn’t even continue watching the video after first few minutes. It was torture. Bro like wtf are you talking about? If every Nepali children grew up in a ‘humble’ family like yours then the reality of each of us would be different. Like I can’t even fathom the level of self-victimisation that she is doing. 72 people lost their life in this demonstration and somehow you want to make it about yourself!! Look at the videos from Pashupatinath the eyes of the parents and the pain you can see. Like how the fuck did you make this whole movement about yourself! Pathetic and Diabolical..|||I couldn’t bring myself to sit through the PR stunt. Whilst I will say, maybe she did make that $$ from her influencer career (if she did I am impressed they pay that much $$), what baffles me is, what is with defending your corrupt father? Like if you can’t question him, have benefitted from his position etc, at least maybe acknowledge that-even mere silence will do. But no, turning everything into an attack on herself is so grand, so her (or how she has conducted and presented herself on every platform thus far). She has everything it takes to be a politician- narcissistic, conniving, manipulation and when all of that fails self-victimization. Yeah, no one is discrediting her book smarts, the fact that she won a beauty contest, she went to Harvard. What gets me is the absolute inability to recognize the privileges she had and still has (anyone whose parents could afford to send them to private schools in Nepal and eventually college are already above the average folks in Nepal). Maybe in her mind privilege equates to being Bill Gates’ daughter- but someone needs to preach to her that privilege is not a blanket concept, the level varies- which I take she is not aware of or doesn’t want to acknowledge. And even with that evidence and what not, I noticed there was a lot of cherry picking. She spent maybe hours putting her excel sheets together and making those videos, but it was an absolute shame to see how tone deaf her response was. This whole movement was for a bigger cause, a cause bigger than the likes of her, what people did was simply point out the discrepancies, the widening gap, and people like her were case in point; however it seems like that went over her head (understandable when all you have done or known is me, myself, and I, it’s hard to fathom that there are real people who are struggling to make ends meet). She came across as an oblivious, self-absorbed person, who when can’t win a debate with evidence will switch to victimizing herself and victim blaming and shaming (sounds a lot like a certain suntala manche who’s running a place).  Overall, is she the only one who has benefitted from corruption in Nepal? No. But I’d have much preferred if she’d kept her mouth shut and gone to Dubai- where I hear Sirohiyas have bought properties in case shit hits the fan in Nepal (A+ for planning and I guess deep down they know what they do/ have done).  Regardless, my worry is this is the next generation of people, and if common Nepalis cannot see through the lies and manipulation and fall for this trickery again, then all those lives lost, infrastructure destroyed would be for nothing. It would be Jana andolan 2.0.  Outside of Shrinkhala there are plenty of ghusiya sarkari karmachari ko kids who have amassed a fortune and generally expect to inherit at least 2-3 million USD (unfortunately includes my own friends and family). And we are talking about normal Nepali sarkari officers’ kids- they fly under the radar, but they are very real. Guess that’s the difference, these guys probably would have gone unnoticed had they kept their businesses out of social media, but SK is something else, seems she likes to double down, she likes the drama, the tea, and she will do anything to stay relevant. Going on a tangent here, but most of us would not have known about just how much money the Deuba’s have, had it not been for Deuba’s DIL and her sister posting all those trips, pictures, and what not.  I think we as a collective just need to stop with putting these people on a pedestal and rallying around them. It’s a waste of our brain power, time, potential. There is nothing productive or beneficial for general public that has come from these people, some of the blame lies on us as consumers of their content.   P.S. she’s probably salty she no longer gets to be the first lady PM of Nepal.|||I watched the video too and disagree. Whatever she is, she is not a criminal. There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

You took the words out of my mouth. Watching few mins of the video made me realise how out of touch, self- victimised and narcissism runs so deep. Not once did she mention about the victims and what the families of the martyrs had to go through, it was all her image. She even said “only her life has stopped” - can’t even begin to fathom how these words could come of out of her mouth whilst the victims bodies and their family are mourning/ going through right now.|||Don't take it personally.

She won many competitions in school , always an A student , won beauty pageant because she deserved it . Not because she was some politicians daughter. The majority of the people didn’t even know who her father is . It’s easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that’s the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 . Her point was that she never lived a luxurious life until she was Miss Nepal , because that’s the truth . Weren’t people blaming her for living off tax payers money ? That’s why she is defending it with proof . When the whole nation attacks you , questions your integrity it’s natural to be defensive . I’m not against you or her , I am just saying she is not going to say 100% of what you all wanna hear . She is human , she gave her reason as to the reason why didn’t speak up as she was targeted with so much hate and rape threats. And the privilege you’re talking about , would have probably agreed with you if you were talking about Jayvir guy.  But why aren’t people targeting him as well . Most of the nepokids or so called elite people don’t even know a world outside of Kathmandu , can’t speak fluent Nepali . People connected with Shrinkhala from the beginning because she spoke like one of us , was grounded . And this whole point of not acknowledging her privilege . What part of privilege she used to win Miss Nepal ? Anybody can participate in the pageant - regardless of who your parents are . It’s easy to pinpoint others, especially a public figure , especially a woman public figure , and you know it’s so easy to spread negativity. And at this time when the whole comment section is flown with negative comments about her , you expect her to say all the Right words , sentences - who are you all ? Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven’t you never made a mistake in your life ? What good are you getting in being so critical of another public figure and expecting her to say all the right things that belongs to your narrative. Nobody is perfect . Time will always reveal the truth . Stop spreading negative. If people wanna like her support her , let them . If you don’t , just stop spreading hate - it only drains you man ",

Although it makes sense from Indian point of view, India need to instill hatred for all the other countries for their own government to sustain. India would have easily and happily capture Nepal - if we weren't close to China.  The amount of hatred Indians have for themselves is surmount. So, they're sharing it to everyone.

India has free-speech protection for their media. 2. This means, no regulation of media is allowed. 3.

In todays age, clickbait is the way to get most views. And thus all media has gone to the lowest level to get clicks. 7. News is now 24 hours business. There are not that much interesting news to keep people engaged. So, once again the quality drops. 8. The few good media that doesn't involve in this get ignored by everyone because they dont get enough clicks.  During censorship era, Indian govt used to force media to remove articles they dont like.

For instance, people said that some organized bands/crime was taking place respectively were active; this seems to make sense if we look at what happened (beating people, setting things on fire after taking TV monitors etc...). Then there is the issue of the military shooting eagerly at people who were no threat at all - a good example is the video of a car where people walked to that car, assuming the cops could help them, and then suddenly someone from inside the car shooting one guy dead, then driving off. That is very strange - why did they kill someone there? And who were the killers? There are other videos showing strange things. Then there was pillaging and theft - some may have been from individuals who just seized an opportunity, but there are still question marks about that; most genuine protesters don't have as an objective to steal stuff. This all has to be investigated - unfortunately I do not trust any official from Nepal to make a genuine investigation here. It needs external people who are not involved on either side, perhaps investigators from Brazil, Switzerland and Canada; these should be impartial enough.

Nepali Congress played a major major role in overthrowing the Monarchy - so it's valid for these people to support Nepali Congress.  It's not the idea of illiterate.  Our generation are most informed but ill-informed generation. The idea that they know more than their parents is just a bias they hold in their mind.  Didn't you figure out yourself when the time came we need to submit the name for our leader - we had 0 knowledge on whose name we should submit. Apart from 3-4 faces that were prominent on Social Media , we have 0 knowledge about Nepali Politics.  So, stop blaming these people. Instead, try to start with what you can control - educate your family, friends and neighbours.

Some congressi neta from his village helped him find a job in KtM through their congressi contact in KTM. As a result my family (dad and mom) somehow felt indebted to NC for life.   But what is unfortunate is, they could not realize is that this very situation where a decently educated person cannot find a job on merit basis was created by them; they were the problem not the savior.  Party ko manxe nachine kei kaam hudaina, they knew it, and wanted to keep maintaining that contact, hence kept on supporting them.

And from what I have seen very recently, he has stopped seeking suggestions from GenZ crowds.   So everything that he has been doing at this point forward, is solely on his own discretion. Maybe he will try to cite his behaviour as something that is approved by a mass, but clearly it isn’t.   He got to be the face of GenZ because there was no one who wanted to come forward. And at this point of time, I can clearly anticipate that all of fellows from the groups will feel as if they are in the wrong boat right now.   He clearly was never meant to lead any population.|||Khutta dhog na ajai!|||Sudan is not a politician, not a leader. He is a Volunteer and an Activist. A very honest, hardworking, Volunteer/Activist, but not a leader.   He headed the negotiations and got us the interim PM when the country most needed it. We are all very thankful for that.   We should all now ask him to put down the arms and let the PM work.|||Listen to his clarification here. https://youtu.be/GLEFw2N2xAc?si=CRVf8LKpDFmb4clW|||He is a CIA stooge. How come you guys haven't realized yet. How can an NGO guy just go and threaten to take down government twice and threaten Former Supreme Court Judge and first Female PM of Nepal with no fear? He thinks country is his father's property. He will take down the government by his Discord jholey as many times  they don't worship and accept his demand.He wants full veto on how the country works.    What gave him such audacity and confidence? It's definitely CIA and Rajabadi pushing him and supporting him. No common man can do this. |||Kaha vanyo ? Any source.|||Agree!|||I think it is now time for him to reflect on what has happened, the difficult role he played in this fiasco and take a break for himself , for his mental health and for the sake of the leadership which he and his team “scrambled” at the last hour. People can disagree with his role but it is undeniably true that he became a face of representation of the “Gen Z” (aba sabai gen z le choose gare or not is a different debate) at a time when army was constantly asking for us to be unified and bring forth a representative at such a volatile situation. Thankfully the situation solved. But after the negotiations with The President and the subsequent outcomes of the negotiations, he should have taken a back seat and let the person intended to run the position do their work( at the end of the day, us “Gen Z” haru le nai choose garya hola ni ta Sushila Shreeman lai?) And I don’t get his afu chai cabinet ma na basne tara aile aba afu bina ko cabinet ma k hunxa sabai kura afu bata jawos bhanne expectations rakheko dekhda chai I felt he was either arrogant or naive when it comes to governance and how power plays when it comes to running a literal government. I think it would be best for him and his team to take a rest and REFLECT and let the experts do their thing( aba haina bhsne ki ta afai cabinet ma basnu thik hola)   Regarding the family’s demands, I won’t be so quick to comment on it as it as very sensitive issue for them and I don’t think this interim govt  would be so unkind to the families like the past (party kongovts would be). It’s only been  2 days that the govt has been in place, I think his maturity would be reflected if he supports the govt in finalizing the cabinet first and letting the administration come to its daily routine. And then u can always raise the family’s issue. We got to prioritize the country’s wellbeing before anything( sounds very insensitive and heartless but that’s the reality)   At the end of the day, desh sabai kai ho, gen z, gen x, millennials, boomers what not. Even the parties cannot be excluded in the long run. That is our democracy’s reality. I think it would be in everyone interest to think rationally and not emotionally. Because I don’t think govts around the world are run by emotions. Let’s hope we get the election and a safe landing from this situation.

We are currently reviewing and verifying the complaint. After that, only we will be able to take any further stance.\"A 31-year-old female cadre of the UML filed a FIR today at the District Police Range in Kathmandu through postal service, alleging that Mahesh Basnet raped her twice and forced her to have an abortion, killing a two and a half-month-old foetus.  She has also accused Basnet of killing 2 months and 15 days foetus. The victim has alleged that he killed the foetus twice by giving medicine and performing surgery. Basnet has been demanded to be prosecuted for the crime of foeticide as it is contrary to Section 188 of the National Penal Code (Act) 2017. She was forced to have an abortion twice, with the help of medicine and surgery, according to the complaint.  \"The victim has also claimed that her apartment was robbed on the morning of 20 February 2024, on Basnet's instructions to destroy evidence of rape and infanticide. According to her complaint, \"On the instructions of Basnet, two youths entered my apartment, beat me up, and forcibly took away my mobile and other electronic devices.\"",

Public Interest Litigation (PIL)  Nepal’s legal system does allow concerned citizens or groups to file a PIL when there’s gross negligence, unaccountability, or violation of fundamental rights.  In theory, you could file a case demanding transparency and timely investigation in high-profile cases like this.  Realistically, PILs in Nepal often face delays and political interference, but they force the police/courts to respond formally.     2. Human Rights Complaint  You can approach National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of Nepal and file a complaint about police inaction, delays, or suppression of evidence.  NHRC can investigate systemic failure, pressure authorities, and issue recommendations, which can be made public.  Again, the NHRC doesn’t guarantee immediate action, but it’s a formal legal way to hold institutions accountable.     3. Legal Notice to Police  A lawyer can send a legal notice to the police demanding they proceed with investigation within a reasonable timeframe.  This doesn’t guarantee action, but it creates a paper trail showing authorities were warned — useful if things get dragged indefinitely.     4. Limitations  You cannot prosecute Basnet yourself unless you’re the victim or have legal standing.  You also cannot compel politicians to speak; you can only force accountability through judicial pressure on authorities.     - Public Pressure & Awareness  Social media campaigns, petitions, or advocacy groups can pressure authorities to act transparently.  But this comes with risk, because political figures in Nepal can retaliate; tread carefully.|||1 number ko gunda manche yo. Dhamkauni, dada giri garni bahek aru kei gardaina.

They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal.

Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas—warriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn’t even facing him. That wasn’t bravery—it was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed—hundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of “justice”—wasn’t justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn’t stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power—the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces—bear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation—if this is the standard of “justice” that today’s youth believe in—then Nepal’s future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger.

RSP has good and capable leaders who has done something in their field like Biraj Bhakta, Toshima, Sobita, Ashim Shah. They were raising public voice in the parliament and had raised voice against corruption and used to callout the government. On the other hand, Rabi was accused and has not been guilty yet. He had helped a lot of Nepali migrants working abroad and is far better than all these Uml, congress and maoists leaders. He renounced his US citizenship with the hope of doing something for the betterment of Nepal but its sad to see people hating him for no reasons.|||this is so sad|||Good.|||All you guys are happy, but I am worried how is it possible for a new party to form and win an election within 6 months? Form party with Balen you say, but is it easy? Balen is also autocratic on some level, will he listen to people, assemble good people, share power... It's not like being a mayor of Kathmandu where he can do good things independently. Damn! It's truly a mess, and I don't know how we can get ourselves from it, but hope that we will.|||This is sad. She was a hope and was what kept me supporting RSP. Not sure if I have the same support for them anymore.|||Finally! Good for her!|||Balen needs to poach the gems in RSP.|||IN her prior interviews also she has said hinted on this. She said that despite trying to solve the problem even after it has been pointed out the party has kept leader above itself. I think this is for the best. She is one of handful of current politician whom i trust.|||Good on her! RSP has some very shady people in its ranks. Also lacks a proper ideology and vision. Best of luck for a fresh start.|||Good luck, creating a party takes time. TBH politics is a dirty game and people who dont play dirty get pushed out. Even with will to do good you need to play dirty, you need money to campaign, you need to keep supporters on your side. So good luck.|||Well as per the preliminary news ( not confirmed hai suru mai vandai xu to not create confusions).. She told in party meeting ki she won't leave the party yesterday.. ani she left the party now.. well i like her but I am being concious and suspicious about her as well..  let's not trust anyone blindly.....

We don't want the old party guys and we don't have any better alternatives. Gen Z wants a directly elected prime minister, so couldn't the constitution be amended in such a way that even independent candidates can contest in the election?|||Greta job. RSP went down the moment they chose to stick with Rabi Lamichhane despite the SC verdict against him. Swarnim Wagle too in the same path as Rabi.   We are with you Sumana!|||[deleted]|||This is exactly what happens when you have a political party that was built not on a political foundation or ideology but based on stunts and trendy opinion. RaSwoPa is also a cultist party centered around one person.  Now when Balen launches a party it will be the same. I don't know what people are expecting about what comes next..most of the people demanding directly elected PM doesn't even understand the status quo and political landscape and potential direction a directly elected PM can take one day.  They don't even understand what does dissolvement of parliament means and they are unaware that we still have the constitution and directly elected PM election is not possible. So it will be parliament election (if election happen)  That's why I'm saying that the protest was a total mess (no agenda, no leader, no purpose, no political awareness).  The dissolving of parliament was nowhere in the demand..it was pushed by Balen who had no participation in the protest (his own word). The unconstitutional dissolvement of parliament has set a dangerous message. The new election will bring back the same old political parties along with new ones. No one will get majority. We go back into the same system with dangerous political precedence and a much worse economy. People have now realized how easy it is to create chaos and anarchy in Nepal. There's a big chance of Nepal turning into a permanent conflict zone. If you have read history and understand politics, you'll understand that we are heading towards a dark phase. God help us.|||One of the best decisions taken by her|||bidesi buda and bidesi nagarikta bhako lai chai no chance hai aba active policy making thau ma|||She became bigger than RSP.

She shouldn’t have lied yesterday.|||Good decision, she might have to struggle a bit but she is bold and intelligent and i hope she will pull through. RSP will be defending rabi lamichhanes shenanigans for years to come, i hope she can ally herself with few more democrats like wagle and form a party. There will be an ideological vaccum with the decline of nepali congress, that vaccum needs to be filled by genuine liberal democrats. I hope she and other democrats can do that.|||Pradhan mantri banne mahatwakangshya ekdam tibra rahecha Sumana ji ko|||Chunab jitne aat navayera RaSwaPa  le samanopatik bata mantri banaideko thiyo.

I recently lived in a Hacker House in Dubai and it was an amazing experience for focused collaboration, learning, and launching projects. I’m curious if something similar could work in Kathmandu.  What is a Hacker House?  * A short-term shared space for builders: founders, devs, designers, students, creators. * Focused on collaboration, project sprints, workshops, and community events (typically 4–8 weeks).  Why Kathmandu?   There’s a growing tech and student scene here, and I think a hacker house could help bring people together to build and share knowledge.  Questions for you all:  1. Do you think Kathmandu would benefit from a hacker house? 2. What features would matter most (workspace, internet, events, mentorship, hardware lab, etc.)? 3. Have you seen/experienced something like this elsewhere?     👉 If enough people are curious, maybe we can even do a small meetup to discuss further.  Would love to hear your thoughts 🙏",

But building a company quickly showed me a bigger picture. A founder isn’t just a coder you’re a communicator, a coordinator, a salesperson, a project manager. Investors, clients, and teammates don’t care only about elegant code; they care whether you can explain a product in clear English, align a team, and keep promises.  Here’s the mindset shift that hit me hard: \t•\tTechnical intelligence builds the product. You need the skills to create something real. \t•\tEmotional intelligence sells it. You need the skills to talk to customers, handle conflict, and inspire a team. \t•\tEffort multiplies both. No matter how smart you are, the person who keeps showing up and doing the hard, uncomfortable work will outpace you.  Whenever you avoid the call, the pitch, or the awkward conversation because it’s “not your thing,” that’s a signal your emotional intelligence needs reps just as much as your coding skills do.  If you want to build a great tech startup, you can’t pick one side. You need to build and you need to sell. Period.",

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help speay fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly. Make community run 3D printers (like a library, a public property for an entire community) a common sight in Nepal rather than just a strange novelty technology.

            "body": "Context: Back in 2023, I jumped into this \"SEO\" thing for my startup because I thought, “hey, this can’t be that hard.” I just have to write some good blogs, add a few \"targeted keywords\" in the content, send emails to few prospect for \"link building\" and then BOOM Google will show my site in the first page.  Nope. Not even close.  I spent months publishing content (more than 20+ articles) I thought they were amazing. But when I checked Google? Page 10. Page 12. Basically invisible. And every time I tried to ask “why isn’t this ranking?” most answer I got from SEO gurus was mostly the same two words:  “Your Content is good, but SEO TAKES TIME\"  And then, of course, the golden advice: “Just build quality backlinks.”  Okay… but what does that actually mean?  How many backlinks do I need?  \"SEO TAKES TIME\" okay, but exactly how long specifically for my target \"keyword\" I want to rank for?  And getting backlinks from what kind of sites is good enough to be considered as \"high quality backlinks\" purely for my targeted keyword?  And how the hell do I guest post without spamming “keyword + write for us” into Google and begging random sites for guest posts?  That’s when it hit me: what if there was a tool that didn’t just say “build quality backlinks,” but literally broke it down for you? Like Google saying  “To rank for this keyword, you’ll need around 42 backlinks from DA 28-32 sites, you site MUST LOAD under 2.5 seconds, have 3 supporting articles, and ~4 months of consistency. Oh, and here’s the exact strategy to actually get those backlinks without generic guest posting BS.”  So… I built it.  It’s called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com). It’s a tool where you type in your target keyword (for example: “best AI tools in 2025”), and it tells you:  How many backlinks you’ll realistically need  What domain authority range those backlinks should come from  How long it’ll probably take to rank  What technical fixes you need to make  And most importantly → the strategy to actually hit those requirements  I’m not saying this magically gets you to Page 1 overnight (SEO is still work). But at least now you can start with clarity instead of guesswork with Pikera SEO.  Right now, Pikera SEO is in early access, and we’re running a waitlist here: https://pikeraai.com/waitlist.  If you’re a founder, marketer, or just someone tired of SEO “it depends” answers, I think you’ll find it useful.  But I’d also love your feedback: if you were using a tool like this, what’s the #1 thing you’d want it to tell you about your keyword? Because I’m still improving it, and honestly, hearing from people in communities like this is way more valuable than any \"SEO guru’s\" advice.  That’s it. Just wanted to share my journey, my frustration, and what I built out of necessity.  If anyone’s been through the same SEO pain, I’d love to hear your story too.",

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance.

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.  Shrinkhala said harvard was funded by $ she had saved up from influencer income she had made post miss nepal.that's what she said.  Podcast frm less than 2 wks ago.|||Honestly wanted to hear this from someone at Harvard. In Nepal we already had similar rumors of her student life here 5 year s back but they were ignored.   I have no hate for her. But if she was really someone she portrays herself to be then she would have used her platform to condemn the 19 students murder after day 1 of protest when we all were scared and angry about what’s gonna happen next.

Thanks for your insight, OP!!|||Instead of that unfollow trend circling around , it should have been “report account” trend.|||Color me unsurprised|||I trust every words you said.I felt this to my gut when you shared about the teamwork thing and how she treated her peers more like servant and less like an actual teammate. These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.

I’m saying this as a Nepali because there are so many kids that have the potential to study there and even get into the school but can’t even afford it.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image. That’s not just tone-deaf, it’s calculated. The timing, the fake vulnerability, the “I’m innocent” narrative, it’s all image management. And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It’s actually disgraceful. Her silence during the peak of the movement spoke volumes, and now this video just confirmed everything people feared about her.

It’s a different story but that’s exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala’s videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It’s one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we’re dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it’s not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it’s not easy, but it’s part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she’s only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||More the explanation more the lie.|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her? I have read somewhere that people hate her now because she said she will fight against corruption when she is the daughter of Binod Khatiwoda so that made her a hypocrite. Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||K garos ta garna chai, yeti sab vaisakdaa, yeti sab accusations huda, euta manche le aafno clarification ta dihalxha ni yr.

I wanted to see pictures of that 'rescue' operation. Having some free time, I did some internet digging and found a facebook page of Nepal Army posted on October 2023. It exactly matches the news portals and tiktok user's claim, plus Shrinkhala’s story(it's on her story highlights). Yes, Summit air use gareko vlog cha, but my guess is ktm to dolpa jana lai use gareko ho, not return to ktm.   Picture: collage of the picture on fb page of Nepal army, then Shrinkhala’s group of 9 people who went to Shey Phoksundo. Luga haru milcha, anuhar ni milcha. You can see that it's the same group.   This really shows how much power is misused in Nepal and the recent nepo-kids trend was helpful to shed light on this.

            "body": "It’s been a roller-coaster ride for Rabi.   He started the program Janta Sanga Pradhanmantri. The show became a hit because of his bold questions to Prime Ministers, but he was eventually kicked out by Prachanda. That led him to create Sidha Kura Janta Sanga, which again gained massive popularity as he raised issues about migrant workers in the Gulf, corruption, and public suffering.  To continue, he even renounced his U.S. citizenship since his visa wasn’t being extended. He started a new journey, but unfortunately, the person who was funding him had been illegally taking money from cooperatives. Now Rabi is the only one facing trial for all cooperative scandals, even though there’s no actual proof of him being a member, chairman, or loan-taker.  And now, even Insta/TikTok/Reddit one-liner “politics experts” are against him. So, in total Congress, UML, Maoists, RPP, journalists, and now even Gen-Z from Discord, Insta, and TikTok.  Jailers fail to control prisons, prisoners escape, and yet people say: “Rabi le vagayo!” They joke with things like “Set Wet,” “hair gel,” pretending to be cool.  * He managed to break into mainstream politics as an alternative—something Baburam and Ujjwal dai couldn’t do because they lacked crowd-pulling power. * He used the votes and seats he earned to give a platform to people like Sumana and Swarnim. * He exposed Nepalese media, their syndicates, narratives, and manipulations. * People hated Arzu, Deuba, and Oli mostly because of the way they treated him. * Many problematic bills were stopped or opposed thanks to his exposure—like the one that would’ve made corruption cases expire after 5 years. * He didn’t compromise, even when accused in the cooperative case, and even when offered the PM seat by Congress. * He stood up against Deuba, Arzu, Oli, and Gagan—and ended up in jail after the new government formed.  Gen-Z: if you were triggered by “nepo kids,” fine. But remember—your parents’ anger and frustration over the injustice done to Rabi was one of the reasons you were even allowed to protest in the first place.  So Gen-Z, it’s okay if you don’t like him. That’s your choice. But he doesn’t deserve the hate that comes from your half-baked political knowledge. If you can’t support him, at least ignore him.

I hope his case is heard soon and he’s proven innocent. Rabi seems much gutsier and stronger than Balen.

Rabi is one among a very fewcandidates whom I really want to give a chance.

Happy birthday Ravi sir, come back clean and prove your haters wrong.|||Rabi is cool … he just needs to wait 6 months or whenever the next election and compete with Balen and Sumana for the spot.

Source of information nowadays is RONB, random pages from facebook and Instagram reels for most of the people. And you know how these pages are.

He is most unlucky political leader of Nepal.|||He isn't totally wrong person, He is having a bad time and especially after what had happened few days ago, he got more haters  He is one of the important person to whom citizens have high hope|||Yo post yeta bhanda ni Facebook ra Tiktok tira jaruri cha , asti samma Rabi nai sab thok bhanne , ek jana ley k bhandinxa manche haru yeti manipulative chan ani hamro janta yeti naive chan je ni pattyauchan.

I disliked how GenZ acted with herd mentality on the subject of Rabi Lamichhane. They don't know how easy it is to frame someone and jail someone in Nepal. Everything from Legislative to Executive to Judiciary is corrupt and completely pervaded by the old parties, but their insistance on pronouncing Rabi as guilty instead of accused is very problematic.  I have a question though:  >Many problematic bills were stopped or opposed thanks to his exposure—like the one that would’ve made corruption cases expire after 5 years.  Was it really stopped?

Heck, even a directly elected PM can do nothing if he doesn't have the majority in the parliament.|||Hope sushila madam will go through his cases, it will obviously be the nicest thing, if he got proven innocent.|||Its so relief to see someone who actually understands him in the crowd of politically unaware population who don't know shit about the politics and injustice .

That’s your choice. But he doesn’t deserve the hate that comes from your half-baked political knowledge. If you can’t support him, at least ignore him.|||Finally some sensible posts regarding Rabi. Been following Nepali politics for 5 years now and I can say rabi has been the most accountable political leader so far. No matter what allegations you throw at him he has always tried his best to clear them. They first charged cases regarding citizenship and passport, faced them in the court and won. Then cooperative fraud surfaced in the media and has been fighting from the court with not a single day spent in hospital unlike other politicians. The original allegations were cooperative fraud but the allegations lacked evidence and the parliament committee cleared him in the direct involvement in taking loans illegally but suggested he be investigated for using the funds as he was MD in the company the loans were funneled into. He has now ongoing cases of organized crime and money laundering which does not make any sense.   Many people hate him and it seems every genz is following the trend of hating them with absolutely zero fact check and zero knowledge of what was happening in the last few years in Nepali politics. I never take anybody seriously if their political knowledge is limited to \"we should make Balen Shah PM and only Nepal will improve\". Our generation should be thankful to rabi for bringing in people like sumana, swornim, sobita, toshima, chanda, biraj, sishir and several other competent people to politics and parliament. The parliament committee meeting suddenly became important and started gaining public attention. They made amendments, led discussion on different bills and made sure  the bill did not pass unchecked. The parliament felt different and they were vocal about different issues. They raised voices on cooperative frauds, meter-byaji problems, issues related to laghubitta and were vocal on human traffic cases. They were the best opposition the parliament had ever seen even if they were in small numbers. Rabi appeals to certain generation of citizen and gains a lot of votes. But he used his popularity to provide a platform for competent people to come forward and unlike every other political parties leader he seems to let his party members work independently and exercise any freedom. People say RSP is divided and every politician seems to have their own opinion. But isn't that a good sign. At least they are transparent and do not have to please their party leadership.|||honestly you changed my opinion and how you are fighting in comments, i looked more and i think without him, it will be hard to beat those jholey haru. i hope everybody realize this soon.|||You deserve more than1000 upvotes man… Some rationally thinking person  This new 18/19 yr olds have no clue what a guy this is Unerma xitfut political awareness lyaune nai rabi ko samsaad harle ho… Aile usaile target gardai xan..

Yes he's done bad work but compered to other people it's a very minor one but still gets equal criticism as other chor netas|||I don't think he's a bad person or has bad intentions. But i don't think Rabi has a strong political understanding or the genuine political motivation other than his ego feeding nationalism. Politics is a mechanism that binds together a nation with different group of people. Nepal is a diverse country with different groups of people that think and believe differently. Which is why only a common ideology can bind together this nation - nothing else can do it, impossible. Anti-corruption is not an ideology, ofc everyone wants that but as I said before all diverse groups have different thinking and beliefs and they can contradict with each other. In situation like this, unless you have a really strong political ideology (like religious ideology) that binds together the nation, this nation will never be stable and will always go into conflict.   People like Rabi and Balen thrives in chaos. These people offer fuel for the chaos that people are looking for because people are angry, they are unhappy, there's hatred. But these group of people will change when Rabi and Balen will come into power because there's no way they will be a perfect leader. Even when they come in full power, because of situation of Nepal, they will not be able to deliver as per people's expectations because our society won't reform and we are geographically in complex situation and economically we are poor.   This Gen Z movement has completely lost its meaning. Nepal is heading towards a really dark phase. The andolan itself was full on chaos and anarchy..no agenda, no leader, complete mayhem. This is going to backfire so badly that Nepali people have no idea whats coming for them. Election in 6 months is almost impossible given the situation of institutions and political parties and upcoming conflicts. Things won't be smooth from here. If election doesn't happen in 6 months, then God save us because what will happen might be the end of our nation or Monarchy - those are the only two options besides old political parties taking control.|||Totally agree with you. Honestly, even though Rabi Lamichhane was opportunistic, he used that opportunity to bring in deserving MPs and created a common platform for an alternative power. Compared to the three main traditional leaders, he appeared far better, and I won’t forget his positive contributions.  After Balen won, when Rabi dai stepped in, I was a bit worried he might try to hijack that momentum on September 9, so I was very critical of him at the time.  That said, there are still serious ethical and legal issues surrounding him. At a time when we desperately need a clean representative to fight corruption, it feels contradictory that he himself is entangled in corruption cases. Because of that, I cannot support him right now. While he is fighting his legal battles, I truly believe he should step down as president of RSP.  Also, the name “Rastriya Swatantra Party” feels a bit misleading — it may not be fair to genuine independent individuals in the upcoming election. I hope the party addresses these two issues.  In every other aspect, though, I genuinely think RSP is the best existing democratic party.  By the way, happy birthday Rabi dai — I really appreciate that you surrendered and showed maturity.|||Post by RSP member|||I think its not GenZ that are against him. It is Balen and HarKa PR team including routiney who wants to take benefits. Rabi is the reason of hope for us. I can't see Balen and Harka being a prime minister of this country keeping diplomacy with foreign nations. Honestly, most of these kids don't know or understand politics. You think Balen will be the Primeminister after election with current constitution that will happen in next six month? Are you even registered to vote?

Every life matters, and no one especially a child deserves to suffer such unimaginable violence. It is deeply troubling that systemic negligence, mishandled evidence, and lack of urgency have left this case unresolved. We must stand together and demand a transparent, thorough investigation. We must hold institutions accountable and ensure that no other family is forced to endure the same pain and silence.  Let us honor Nirmala’s memory not with silence, but with action. She deserves justice. Her family deserves peace. And our society deserves the truth.",

If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal.

All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him ....

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him.

That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”.

Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters.

They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there. If he just sits in his office chair waiting mindlessly while everybody is reaching him out to take a step then its alarming, is he really a possible prime minister candidate?? doubt huna thalchha, veda harlai feri yo bhanda pachdaina, he has some done good things too as a mayor but idk has he not abandon us when we needed him most? Aba desh ko yo awasta ma he is not a good leader anyways, pachhi aba j hunchha dekha jayega.

If he choose to be interim PM then people would have said he planned this all to come to power and be dictator.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case. It still remains a fact that he could have interacted with us when he we needed him the most.|||such simple world if it did exist why would so many intellects be in the world of politics.

He cannot send city police when there is already armed police and army on the road, direct threat of murder, he did right thing staying hidden.

Main plot is, it is not gen-z who made this government to fall, and we are still not sure why genz representative got to chose the leader and succeeded. The term bheda for nepali will be there forever because we lack education apart from our domain and will blindly follow anyone who has a good profile according to us in that field.|||Balen ta merai age ko hola.

Your country has been too kind to me whenever I visit. I literally started my export business with Nepal as my first destination  I have very sweet memories of Nepal and especially of its people: full of joy and compassion. Never bothered to give up to the boiling pace of life.   What the Genz achieved is a lesson to the whole world. An outstanding solidarity display. The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous. You are now literally resorting to violence as enjoyment.  Keep your Nepali spirits intact. You are one of the most righteous people I have ever seen.   Make your beautiful nation great!|||public , live execution|||A moment that all nepali can share.|||While GenZ will rejoice at this, I just feel sad watching this.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems).

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

I never thought he was so power hungry to become the Prime Minister of Nepal|||in my opinion shusila karki is best fit for interim PM, age doesnt matter for current situation we need stablity, development later, and after that we will go for youth leaders.|||Ani usko ideology ta halka racist casteist hoina ra|||Shram Mantri banaideu mugi lai|||Eslai kosaile seriously lidaina .

We need people elected leader not mob selected leader and think of it when any of these guys go to foreign countries for visit will anyone take them seriously they won't because mob selected leaders are ignored just like Md.Yunus is ignored by major world leaders(except China).  Considering we're in a democratic system with democratic framework, I suggest Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Nepal should be given the interim power because Legislature-Executive-Judiciary are the head of country, since President is said to be planning to resign and PM has resigned best would be to get Judicial head. You might say he's corrupt but hear me out, his only job should be to conduct fair elections and fulfill the demands of us(youth) as he's the only guy who knows about constitution more than any of us. I see only him as the one with intellect right now  According to me, Sushila Karki being former Chief Justice should held interim gov, and add the presidential style election, and the elections should be within 15days-1month. for which we gen-z's should help if we can destroy we should show we can also be a help|||Tiyo post ma garw chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu gardi bascha 😂😂|||https://preview.redd.it/dlrjv8jm1gof1.jpeg?width=442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c0337eb5a438e5909e840f83db267f87a0b99a  found this making rounds in fb|||Mai hu malie sab aoucha vanne wana ego wala manchey ho  Ani yo kirati haru afno jaat vayera dherai furkirako ho  Muji haru lai tha chai kei chqina pachi k huncha vanera Dhunga bokera matra desh bandaina gu haru dimak ka cha ta haru ko|||Her keta ho.

Dr Baburam is also a good candidate. But he can lean towards Prachanda.|||Yeah, bro!  Now, the nation is seeing the true colors of the Harka.  There have been big changes since 2047, up to 2062-2063.  Public property and individuals were not targeted.  But this time, to suppress the voices, he used his goons to burn down the homes of the people who rose up against him.  He left the DRN to be PM, taking his so-called \"jhole.\"|||I'm from Dharan.   I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him. It wasn't because of his popularity, but because of that frustration.Look at his recent activity, he cannot coordinate with the 20 members and bring the budget in on time   And so called the Sharaman, it's the illusion, of the corruption|||Not being a racist, but most people who are blindly supporting him are from Mongolian ethnicity ( mostly Rai and Kirati) .|||Even Kulman is a corrupt person.

He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency. The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We’re falling into the same trap again. Don’t buy into the smooth talk and fake charm — check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they’ve been tested in real battles. I’m done with sugar-coated leaders; give me someone who spits facts and takes action. Doing the right thing in a rotten system is never easy, and that’s why tried-and-tested leaders matter. Supporting Rajesh Hamal? That’s just a fantasy.|||Harka Sampang? you guys cant handle now i am sure|||तिमीहरुको कुरा सुन्दा अचम्म लाग्यो ।प्रकृया के हो , कसरी चल्छ केहि थाहा रहेनछ । देश जोक हो? चुनाव गराउनलाई सम्रचना छैन , चुनाव सजिलो कुरा सोच्या छौं ?? भोली चुनावको बैधताको को कुरा आउँछ , देश बिदेश बाट inspection हुन्छ । हल्का रुपमा नलेउ है । जति चाडो डिसिजन गर्यौ बुझेर त्यति फाइदा हो अलिक पछि त यो पाराले पानी पनि भन्न पाउँदैनौं , बर्षौदेखि राज गरेका पार्टि र तिनका कार्यकर्ता निक्लन्छन नै, उनिहरुसँग नेक तिकडम हुन्छन जुन तिमिहरुले बुझ्न पनि सक्दैनौ । if you need right suggestion and whole process i can help to brief.|||Constituion should be ammended so politicians are no longer called leaders and they cannot enjoy a career.|||He would make a good dictator and actually do good for the country. But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime 😂|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to. It feels like waste of my taxes. Now even democracy is undermined. I think this will repeat again in 10 to 15 year|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore . May be he isnt eligible for primeminister as the lacks some level of diplomacy and its skill but he can be best suited in ministries like : Industry and commerce , Infrastructure, Agriculture . Uneducated neta haru bhrastachari garne haru vanda he is 1000 time better hai guys afno bhawana ma na aaunu|||We need stoic and determined leader like Harka, who has always done good works for the country.

U all r pretty blinded by jealousy and his popularity. Only in a lifetime we get such leader. He’s not quite and shy like Kulman who was loathing when he got fired and insulted from his job, Harka is just an Enigmatic person and leader!

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

September 8 at least 50% unrelated moles enter protest incite violence the police plays along then came the ones using actual bullets.  September 8 nighttime every single one of thugs for hire was paid to do organized premeditated almost military level planned attacks.  Sep 9 they straight up start attacking ( high rank officials usually have a ton of armed police and stuff which cannot be seen anywhere )  The lack of police on the streets says a lot maybe the ones holding the guns are the police working for prachandey or some other forces , most of the ones holding guns knew how to use it straight away so. .  The lamichane escape with freeing criminals as a distraction was nicely orchestrated.     Nepal is now in another chaos  If maoists and rsp do not come clean of this they should be hunted like pigs they are.|||Lets not be idealist :We need one caretaker prime minister .And rabi is the only choice .k chai dirty politics garyo rabi le?

Emails: grad@uci.edu reportfraudtips@uscis.dhs.gov Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Sweta Rijal’s Status Dear Graduate Office/USCIS/ICE, I am writing about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration.

This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us. Please everyone don't let the President resign until a new government is formed. Protect the country. The damages are not done by Gen-z, they are done by the political goons. Find Prachanda, bring him to justice. |||This has to be as violent as it can get.  Fear is the only thing that keeps the immoral nature of humans in check.

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

Destroying District Administrative Office, Regional Offices 4. Releasing Rabi Lamichhane, a corrupt politician without getting cleared by court 5. Releasing more than 40-50k criminals from jail all over the country WHO THE FUCK WILL TAKE DAMN RESPONSIBILITY IF SOME OF THOSE CRIMINALS, THIEVES, MURDERERS, RAPISTS, PSYCHOPATHS REDO ALL THOSE CRIMES AGAIN?   HOW MUCH PROTECTIVE OUR PARENTS, FAMILY AND SISTERS WILL FEEL NOW KNOWING JUST 1200 CRIMINALS ARE JUST RELEASED FROM THE JAIL NEARBY THEIR HOUSE?   DO YOU REALISE HOW MUCH VENGEANCE AND \"BADLA LINCHU\" IS FILLED IN THOSE GUYS AGAINST SOME PEOPLE?  6. Beating innocent people and harassing young girls by forcefully knocking at the girls hostels at several places.  7. Destroying banks and robbing those banks; sala khatey tw jo koi hos tw sachchai bhikari kai santaan raichas, tw muji lai kei pugeko narahecha jindagi ma, na ta kei ukhadnw nai sakis muji, tw muji lai ta aba MA PANI VANCHU yo sab kura tyo sab kura Bibek Thapaliya khatey le vaneko.  8.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Balen cannot do that, Harka is very very incapable of that. Etibela we should look for someone who's least politically inclined and has very little tainted personality.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

Sumana didi is a good person but certainly not the one whom we can chose to lead. I know very well of the core team and they have done a good job as a MP but she has to either quit her association with RSP if she has to become the genz representative or should be part of a guiding figure and more like a sallahakar kind of role to the genz representative. Because she has to come as Sumana as an individual , if she comes as a cadre of RSP, RSP le aaune election ma tesko rajnitik byaj khancha(RSP is going to take away a significant portion of credit, which is not at all fair. Because we didnt trust RSP in any way but we just supported a person)And everyone please be clear, RSP ko political roti sekna gareko haina yo revolution.  And Balen dai got serious dictatorial tendancies like someone here rightly mentioned. Leader got to be calm. Bhid lai unite garne leader chaiyeko cha hamlai uttejit banaune haina. Josh bharnu thik cha tara tesle naya polarization ma lagnu hunna statelai. We have already suffered alot from that.  But both of them are good leaders and massive respect to both of them for their relentless effort so far and we need their active contribution in rebuilding the new Nepal.  As of today , we need a solid figure with proven record that can unite us as a nation, this protest was led by GenZ but its not only the GenZ’s nation.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both. As long as they are both in the interim government in some manner, despite any roles, everyone will be happy.|||sagar dhakal is educated and seems he can fight any battle , even challenged deuba back in the days .man got guts even in 0|||SUSHILA KARKII|||Sushila Karki would be the best bet.

This will be interim government to conduct elections which means he will not be able to contest for it, if he takes the office now. Additionally, We don’t have practice of PM contesting for other smaller roles later in life. Maybe thats the reason he is not taking it.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4. He is RSP . Haven't issued anything about Ravi being released from prison by their goons.   5. She most probably planned this Gen z nonsense knowing well that it would cause this .|||Since no one knew who to send as a Gen Z representative, I chose to highlight a woman and a man who reflected the majority’s demands. BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

I get his appeal but I still think he should remain mayor for another term. He couldn't accomplish a lot of things because of the previous government. He might be able to achieve more with a sensible government.  Sumana is smart and I feel like she has a level head on her. Head of state requires someone to be diplomatic as well as bold.

Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this? To the same people who contributed in yesterday's mess and encouraged people to carry stones with them and to those same people who soft banned or removed posts when people showed concern over this idea when they realised how bad of an idea it is? Even the mods here are equally responsible for removing and deleting content where people like me were against this protest because we knew for a fact this was going to turn very violent and people are not going to protest peacefully because it did not look like they would especially here on reddit.

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

I might be wrong, but I believe, dissolution of the current parliament, an interim government led by candidates \"from the people, by the people, for the people\" - in it's truest sense, followed by a constitution reform for a directly elected state head is the answer.|||Prachanda has a history of working with RAW agency|||CIA?|||U janme Dekhi Nepal ma ashanti aako ho.|||even if he isn't he still needs to be brought to justice. kata lukeko xa yo chor.|||https://preview.redd.it/5spe7l1kqaof1.jpeg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0d5c200ef042d362e6344ad5b4e5d44dfd8e5e|||Probably|||https://preview.redd.it/qa507b014bof1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=594aa8a1c71a75c3eed28738e71393a88338e07f|||Yes he is one of them, mass murderer 😡😡|||Yes maathi inquiry garna mildaina without any influence aba.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him ....

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

We have civilization connect that exists for thousands of years. Far before countries as a concept existed. Seeing our people in pain hurts us. 2. Indian mainstream media is shit. Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.  I hope our youth draws the inspirations from all the other countries' youth around us.|||ke ho yaar comments ma nepali bhnda bdi indians chn , ysri bolnu hola trnslate garna nsakos|||It's classic.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation.

It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

If he choose to be interim PM then people would have said he planned this all to come to power and be dictator.   Also he got death threats during that time.|||it depends on his role during these 2 days. back support thiyo bhane that is good.

His support ismuch needed in this time as he is the face of gen z, even though he wants it or not.|||Wait, you think Balen should have stepped up to be the PM? I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians. He abandon hope rey, road ma gayera purano polician jasto navako jatra gardai hidne? support ko name ma post garna matrai thalni?

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case. It still remains a fact that he could have interacted with us when he we needed him the most.|||such simple world if it did exist why would so many intellects be in the world of politics.

He cannot send city police when there is already armed police and army on the road, direct threat of murder, he did right thing staying hidden. Even if he visited the wounded he would have faced another critisism like harka sampang labelling him as opportunitist.  Main plot is, it is not gen-z who made this government to fall, and we are still not sure why genz representative got to chose the leader and succeeded. The term bheda for nepali will be there forever because we lack education apart from our domain and will blindly follow anyone who has a good profile according to us in that field.|||Balen ta merai age ko hola.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.   Fighters who believed they sacrificed for justice and equality still respect him as the leader who turned their struggle into a new political order.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

We need people elected leader not mob selected leader and think of it when any of these guys go to foreign countries for visit will anyone take them seriously they won't because mob selected leaders are ignored just like Md.Yunus is ignored by major world leaders(except China).  Considering we're in a democratic system with democratic framework, I suggest Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Nepal should be given the interim power because Legislature-Executive-Judiciary are the head of country, since President is said to be planning to resign and PM has resigned best would be to get Judicial head. You might say he's corrupt but hear me out, his only job should be to conduct fair elections and fulfill the demands of us(youth) as he's the only guy who knows about constitution more than any of us. I see only him as the one with intellect right now  According to me, Sushila Karki being former Chief Justice should held interim gov, and add the presidential style election, and the elections should be within 15days-1month. for which we gen-z's should help if we can destroy we should show we can also be a help|||Tiyo post ma garw chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu gardi bascha 😂😂|||https://preview.redd.it/dlrjv8jm1gof1.jpeg?width=442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c0337eb5a438e5909e840f83db267f87a0b99a  found this making rounds in fb|||Mai hu malie sab aoucha vanne wana ego wala manchey ho  Ani yo kirati haru afno jaat vayera dherai furkirako ho  Muji haru lai tha chai kei chqina pachi k huncha vanera Dhunga bokera matra desh bandaina gu haru dimak ka cha ta haru ko|||Her keta ho.

Dr Baburam is also a good candidate. But he can lean towards Prachanda.|||Yeah, bro!  Now, the nation is seeing the true colors of the Harka.  There have been big changes since 2047, up to 2062-2063.  Public property and individuals were not targeted.  But this time, to suppress the voices, he used his goons to burn down the homes of the people who rose up against him.  He left the DRN to be PM, taking his so-called \"jhole.\"|||I'm from Dharan.   I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him. It wasn't because of his popularity, but because of that frustration.Look at his recent activity, he cannot coordinate with the 20 members and bring the budget in on time   And so called the Sharaman, it's the illusion, of the corruption|||Not being a racist, but most people who are blindly supporting him are from Mongolian ethnicity ( mostly Rai and Kirati) .|||Even Kulman is a corrupt person.

If anything he is worst.|||Isn’t educated re.yo muji lai vanndeu kaisile kp le 8 sama matra padeko thyo|||No, he is a missionary|||Yes Harka Sampang indeed and is the one right person for now, even A mother won't feed his baby, untill he cried out. He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency. The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We’re falling into the same trap again. Don’t buy into the smooth talk and fake charm — check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they’ve been tested in real battles. I’m done with sugar-coated leaders; give me someone who spits facts and takes action. Doing the right thing in a rotten system is never easy, and that’s why tried-and-tested leaders matter. Supporting Rajesh Hamal? That’s just a fantasy.|||Harka Sampang? you guys cant handle now i am sure|||तिमीहरुको कुरा सुन्दा अचम्म लाग्यो ।प्रकृया के हो , कसरी चल्छ केहि थाहा रहेनछ । देश जोक हो? चुनाव गराउनलाई सम्रचना छैन , चुनाव सजिलो कुरा सोच्या छौं ?? भोली चुनावको बैधताको को कुरा आउँछ , देश बिदेश बाट inspection हुन्छ । हल्का रुपमा नलेउ है । जति चाडो डिसिजन गर्यौ बुझेर त्यति फाइदा हो अलिक पछि त यो पाराले पानी पनि भन्न पाउँदैनौं , बर्षौदेखि राज गरेका पार्टि र तिनका कार्यकर्ता निक्लन्छन नै, उनिहरुसँग नेक तिकडम हुन्छन जुन तिमिहरुले बुझ्न पनि सक्दैनौ । if you need right suggestion and whole process i can help to brief.|||Constituion should be ammended so politicians are no longer called leaders and they cannot enjoy a career.|||He would make a good dictator and actually do good for the country. But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime 😂|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to. It feels like waste of my taxes. Now even democracy is undermined. I think this will repeat again in 10 to 15 year|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government. Balen it is.

We need an honest leader with integrity and accountability who'll jail all corrupt officials.|||I think sushila karki for now|||Also there were claims of him being discriminating towards Aryans.|||so for your kind information these are why he  may be eligible candidate: 1) He isnt uneducated : He has passed bachelors in something like politicl science and he knows the most of the revolution how they worked and the principles of famous people , 2) He can relate : he is a person just like us from a middle class family and knows the value of society  3) Revolunatiory: We cant ignore how he and his team constructed a water project , a established (shram park) with local and nepalese funds ( donations) 4) accountability and sense of belonginess: unlike other politicians ,he takes his area as his own house and sees his areas citizen as his member of family , he is accountable and alwyas tries to show the proof of funds 5) His first prioriuty is to utilize his resources maximumly , Unlike federal gov and so called politicians who beg for international funds , enjoys commission and get the country into Debt trap . Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore . May be he isnt eligible for primeminister as the lacks some level of diplomacy and its skill but he can be best suited in ministries like : Industry and commerce , Infrastructure, Agriculture . Uneducated neta haru bhrastachari garne haru vanda he is 1000 time better hai guys afno bhawana ma na aaunu|||We need stoic and determined leader like Harka, who has always done good works for the country.

U all r pretty blinded by jealousy and his popularity. Only in a lifetime we get such leader. He’s not quite and shy like Kulman who was loathing when he got fired and insulted from his job, Harka is just an Enigmatic person and leader!

(**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Emails: grad@uci.edu reportfraudtips@uscis.dhs.gov Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Sweta Rijal’s Status Dear Graduate Office/USCIS/ICE, I am writing about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us.

And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao.

Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

I agree they were already rich, but not *that* rich to the point where they could afford four international trips a year!

Lets gooo|||It’s about whether that legacy is being used today as justification for unchecked privilege, unearned positions, and continued control over public resources.  You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesn’t make it the full truth.  We’ve seen this before — remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. It’s the same pattern here — society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says “the girl must be the victim.” But is that always true? No.  Let’s also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will “chase” them — and when he does, suddenly it becomes “stalking.” Where’s the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe she’s not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. That’s disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole family’s dignity too.  Everyone’s commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But let’s be honest — most of that is just because she’s a girl and he’s a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if he’s actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, it’s not fair to publicly assassinate someone’s character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldn’t let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  don’t bully her. Only message her.

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Can the current president do that without the prime minister’s recommendation?  Sushila Karki has a strong record of standing against corruption which is exactly what this protest is about.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊.

He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, “Dai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it’s been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn’t know what to say. That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him.

As Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, she has already proven her ability to lead with integrity and impartiality under immense political pressure. Her reputation for upholding the rule of law and fairness makes her uniquely qualified at a time when credibility is everything. Most importantly, she understands the mechanics and urgency of holding a fair election which is the single most crucial step to stabilizing the country right now. If we want an interim leader who is both capable and trusted by the public, there’s no better choice.|||people saying balen shoud be PM but in my opinion he is not suited for PM, not saying he is bad guy but i doubt he is good at making good relation with other countries, especially one we depend on the most.   she might be a good choice but as people says we need youth to lead the country so i cant say the otherwise,    but as a temporary PM i believe in her, at this time we need someone who can stablize the current situation, development is not the first priority for now,|||I agree for her.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in.

Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

People have Short term memory most of you are gonna forget about today's anger 🤬 and will mostly be happy by the development that has been done in 6 month or a year before election.

Most people will likely vote for the same party again because most people think they are obligated to vote for the same party cause in the time of need or having some legal problems they will help to solve that problem and give special favor and priority to party members.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
