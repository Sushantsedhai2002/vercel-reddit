Although this has become somewhat normal for me, for the past six months I’ve been feeling an uneasy emotion and overthinking a lot. Never in my life have I felt this drained. I feel so much pain in my heart and I’m confused about what to do.  Loneliness is ruining my life. I feel like I’ve lost the spark within me. I no longer have the intention or excitement to learn new skills. I cry a lot and often eat alone at random restaurants.  Even at work, I feel like I don’t belong there, and that everyone is far ahead of me. My heart feels heavy, and I can’t get these thoughts out of my mind.  To be honest, I feel like I’ve spent my whole life being depressed and introverted. Now I find myself questioning: Am I going to live like this for the rest of my life?",

I always wonder if I had done everything right.  Few tips:  1. Never stops woking on your skills. Poverty hurts more than loneliness. 2. Find way to be significant in family. Take care of parents. If possible keep treating them with gifts, tour .. etc 3. Don’t hurry for relationship. Not all the modes of meeting new girls/boys is for everyone. Not everyone is extrovert. You have your own way of meeting/communicating/chatting with others  4. Saving money might not sounds significant today but never break your saving cycle. This will turn out to best thing for you in future.|||That’s because we are social creatures bro. Find a hobby and you’ll naturally find like minded people and be friends.

So ask yourself, why weren't you feeling that way before? Maybe because you were so busy with your work or you were into something which kept your mind in a flow.  Now observe your life. Maybe there is something lacking compared to before, find that thing.  Mostly, humans feel lonely if they don't keep their minds busy so you need to have human connection in day to day life.  Or maybe you're disconnecting from your actual work so make that interesting.  And trying new things is another great way as well.  The answer is within you, my friend.

Life will be very tough if you don't have a few close friends and aren't close to your family by 30. You'll have to compromise on some things and your personality will change because of them. But it will change regardless.|||Mero gym aunu dai sathi banxan 6 7 jana 😝|||How I wish I didn't relate to this.

            "body": "I’m only 18, and stepping into a classroom as a teacher has shattered every illusion I once had about this profession. When I was a student, especially in school, I remember boys in my class making vile, disgusting comments about our female teachers, about the bras they wore, about how “fat” they were, even about what they imagined those teachers did with their husbands in bed. I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face. I never thought I would stand on this side of the desk and feel this broken.",

I mostly teach college kids and they are somehow well-behaved than younger kids out there.  Something I would not say out loud but I keep telling myself as a coping mechanism is that these kids will not stay in your life forever. You are not supposed to look out for them forever either. So, try to ignore their behavior and move on. I do not know how else to put these into words.  I still keep in touch with some of my first students as they are very good kids. They reach out to me for career guidance and such. If they truly respect you and understand the value you bring, it will show up later as well.  Don't get demotivated and try to push through. I have had some difficult moments after classes as well, but a year more than in the classroom you get used to these and learn to tackle them. You might also want to look into things like having some authority in classroom and educational psychology. The latter helped me understand things a bit.  That's all I can say. Good luck with everything. |||[deleted]|||Resign. Teacher at lower levels is one of the worst jobs there is.|||I wanted to be a teacher as a kid too, and I also sometimes called teachers by some names, I stopped calling them when I realised one day that maybe me too.  It must be hard for you cause students only realise these stuff were wrong after they grow up, some don't even although.   You should probably resign tho, trying to fix those kids or ignoring them ain't worth the salary you're getting probably.|||The best thing that you can do at this time is to confront those students. Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more. You're at the position where you can take charge and stand up for yourself. Do it. Don't overthink, don't feel weak or embarrassed about it. You're their teacher and shaming, catcalling or just disrespecting teachers isn't good. You should stand up for this and for yourself. Let the students know that even though you're young, you can take charge and give them punishment. Okay. You're brave. You got this. 🫂|||Hi, I used to be a teacher in nepal. Have a very thick skin. Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment. It might come out very salty but maybe you lack experiences in discliplining a 14 year old because you yourself, you’re 18 and there’s no much of an age difference gap between you and your students. Being a teacher in Nepal isn’t easy with congested classrooms and poor ventilation.|||I always try to slip in some nice motivations or anecdotes about how being nice to other people is going to benefit yourself, and also prove it by rewarding good behaviour and respectful behaviour. I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Which class btw?

I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.",

Here’s what I’ve done so far:  * Reported the phone to NTA and IMEI tracking is active * The device is still linked to my Apple ID * I have not removed it from my account * Find My was unfortunately turned off at the time * No suspicious SMS or phishing messages so far  I understand that without Find My, recovery becomes harder. I’m mainly trying to understand:  1. Has anyone here successfully recovered a phone through IMEI tracking in Nepal? 2. If someone tries to use a SIM in Nepal, how effective is NTA tracking realistically? 3. In most cases here, are stolen iPhones resold, exported, or dismantled for parts?  I’m not looking for basic “enable Find My” advice — I know that was my mistake. I’m just trying to understand how things usually go in Nepal and what to realistically expect.  Any real experiences or insights would be appreciated.",

            "body": "I was hired as a UI/UX intern. They told me during the internship I would be provided with proper guidance, as I didn't have much experience. But to my surprise, I was the only UI/UX there.  As a beginner, my designs were inconsistent, like uneven spacing and all. The CTO used to check whether the spacing is even or not using a damn RULER, on a LAPTOP SCREEN. I thought that was normal, until it wasn't.  Overtime was so normalized in the office. CTO used to always come for design reviews sharp at 6 or after, and expected me to make the changes on the spot.  Sometimes the changes implementations used to exceed 7. Being a student, I told them so many times that I need to get off the work on time for studies and assignments, but they didn't give a damn.  The pay was less than basic. The first 3 months were 6k, then another 3 were 10k, and after that it was 15k. They used to act as if they were doing us favours by paying us.  Now you can often see ad of vacanies like this on insta. But don't fall for it.  https://preview.redd.it/fnpzq00xx6kg1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a30b1f6fc9a568cb76880df47b51760e2e4198e3  Have you ever wondered why they have so many vacancies open so often? Yeah, right, CAUSE NOBODY CAN SURVIVE THEIR TOXIC ENVIRONMENT.  They will be having the vacancies for social media intern every now and then cause yeah koi tikdai tikdaina. They laid off two of their SEO Executives, stating \"they don't need SEO anymore,\" and walla opens vacancies for SEO a few months after. Like timro role ko lagi kaam nahunun jel, aba uniharu lai timi chaena so company bata niska, ani aba SEO ko lagi kaam aayo so feri hire garna suru...wtf.  Will hire you for Account and HR (two in one), and treat you like a slave.

These founders are fleeing the West because of high costs. They are looking for places with:  1. High-speed, reliable internet (Starlink/Fiber). 2. Inspiring nature/environment. 3. **Low Cost of Living.**  Nepal fits the bill perfectly for 2 and 3. If we fix #1 and simplify the visa/payment laws, we attract the *creators* of the AI economy, not the victims of it.

It's the same for a lot of other companies I hear from friends and colleagues.  The reality will be somewhere in between. May be half these jobs will be replaced by AI in the next 5 years. Change will be there, but it may not be as fast as the tech CEOs claim and want.

Big companies like Meta Platforms and Google do not register locally in every country where their services are available.

A government can request data only if there is a criminal investigation or national security matter, and it must follow proper legal process such as a court order or warrant.|||How am i getting VAT receipts from meta(Facebook) for the better part of 2 years if it wasn't already registered?

Well the main thing is if you DO learn something online, ensure that you can do it again without anymore help. And excluding social media from just plain research online is necessary.|||If it's just for college exam, no need to go too in-depth. Basic gist bujhe pugcha. I used to try to study in detailed way as well and find nuances not covered in study material. Try to focus on what you actually need and what is important in life.    For studying, look into flashcard programs like remnote so that you can make notes once and just practice them quickly later instead of constantly memorizing same thing.   Kaam garne bela this thing has actually hampered my progress, where I obsess on perfecting even the smallest thing. Do good enough and move on.

Alik balance chai garnu parcha doing good enough job and not spending too much energy on diminishing returns.    Compare someone who asks gpt to describe infix postfix conversion and gets general gist of how to do its numerical vs someone that hunts down original description of it and goes through multiple resources on it.

The public’s growing frustration with the traditional political parties and leaders due to such elite capture of economy has fueled the rise of pro-Monarchist sentiments and so-called new political parties that lack ideology but are driven by a thirst for power.  >Member of Parliament of a new political party, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Dr Swarnim Wagle, speaking in the parliament last week, showed serious concerns on such elite capture of economy.  >The government reluctance to start second-generation reform and its apathy toward economic issues have eroded Nepal’s economic foundations. It has further encouraged the private sector to compromise on corporate governance. When ethical business practitioners are penalized and fraudsters are rewarded, the private sector loses confidence. The government has, for the past few years, failed to meet its revenue targets, largely due to the declining business confidence of the private sector due to rising cronyism.  >As a result, cartels and syndicates have infiltrated every sector of the economy, which contradicts the basic principles of liberal economy. There is something seriously wrong going on in Nepal because those, who were always opposed to the liberal economic policy, are now exploiting the policy under its guise in the past decades. And to no-one’s surprise, Thermal gun gang has become their closest ally.  >**It is no mystery how the infamous Thermal gun gang has such a strong hold on the government and political parties including Nepali Congress, CPN (UML), Maoist Center, even fringe parties, regional and splinter parties. The gang managed to appoint its minions as chiefs of the Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) – after almost a year delaying for a certain person – in Nepal, the Insurance Authority (NIA) by changing the criterion to favor its chosen candidate. Next, it is also planning to control the Nepal Stock Exchange (Nepse) – the frontline regulator – and even eyeing the appointment of the next governor of the central bank.**  >Just within a month, the tenure of incumbent governor of the central bank Maha Prasad Adhikari will end. And the Thermal gun gang has already started lobbying for a consensus candidate in a way that aligns with the interests of top-level leaders of all major parties to make the 18th governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Instead of an experienced and capable individual, who can lead the financial sector safely, if the government appoints yet another minion similar to recent appointments in the SEBON and the NIA, not only Nepal’s financial sector will suffer immensely but also the burden will fall upon ordinary citizens. The economy will be on the verge of collapse.   [https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/index.php/news/political-parties-are-trying-to-sabotage-election-commission](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/index.php/news/political-parties-are-trying-to-sabotage-election-commission)  [After NRB Governor appointment, coalition focus shifts to Chief Election Commissioner](https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/21/469322/)  >Just days after resolving a month-and-a-half-long dispute within the ruling coalition, the Nepali Congress has secured the appointment of the new Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. Attention within the Nepali Congress–CPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner. **With Congress obtaining the governor’s post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party.**  >Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor. In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner.  >Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant. **The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.**",

And let’s be honest if it was few young guys doing the same thing he wouldn’t even get out of the car lmao. Real life isn’t school playground.|||I mean yeah he can slap someone in the fit of rage but he has to face the consequences as well.

In many ways, it reflects the modern digital content economy, where personal space and identity can become commodities in exchange for visibility and validation.  This is not a criticism of content creation itself. Expression is powerful and necessary. Yet the constant pursuit of attention and dopamine can push individuals to gradually blur their own boundaries.  What once resonated in a literal sense now also resonates digitally.

When you walk into a room full of people, everyone thinks about how you look, dress, walk, and talk, but the exact opposite happens in reality.  When you enter a room, your mind tricks you into thinking you’re the center of attention, but in reality, you become invisible to everyone.  Here’s how:  Just like you overthink what others are noticing about you, they’re overthinking the same about themselves.   You don’t easily notice these things in their body language, and they don’t notice yours either.  In simple terms, there is no audience to perform for, and no one is really watching. You can just walk like you own the room.  For introverts, this idea can be life changing. You’re allowed to exist as you are.  Just a reminder: the biggest battle is always with the voice in your head. Everyone is insecure about something, and most are wearing masks to hide their flaws.

But if I didn't know these things, i would have always thought that my business is running good and m earning well    I always think about our parent's time. When they used to work, their earning was never how much we can earn in jobs these days. But they were never this concerned about how much they could earn if they moved outside. Its all social media life style and comparison now.   Plus nobody outside will tell you how much they struggle, and how they feel far away from their family.   I might be less experienced than you guys, or haven't faced that level of problems, still will advice to stop comparing with others.|||Reflect on your past 6 years. I'm sure they've been horrendous are you progressing? I don't just mean money but knowledge and networking.  It usually takes 5-10 years in the game to finally start making money from being an entrepreneur in Nepal. But unfortunately most people realize this isn't what they want to do.  If you still have genuine hope, strive on. Most of your competition has quit or are in their infancy stages while you have 6 years under your belt.|||I feel this post deeply.  I work in a software company as a Sales Manager, and I’ve had the exact same thoughts recently. Especially after I had a daughter. When you become a parent, the whole “stay and build the country” dream suddenly competes with “can I give my child stability and security?”  I also started a small company on the side (xyz). It’s not easy. Market is slow, payments get delayed, policies change, and sometimes it feels like the system tests your patience more than your skills. Meanwhile, friends abroad are buying cars, saving money, living structured lives with predictable systems.  I’ve made a personal deal with myself ; I’ll try here seriously until I’m 39. If I succeed, great. If I fail, I won’t let ego stop me from leaving. I don’t see leaving as betrayal anymore. I see it as strategy.  Staying is meaningful. But it should not cost your mental health, your family’s future, or your dignity.  The real question isn’t “Is leaving right?”   It’s “Are you growing, stable, and respected where you are?”  If yes : stay and build.   If no : maybe your impact just needs a different geography.  Whatever you choose, make sure it’s driven by long-term clarity, not temporary frustration.|||After living abroad for 10 years, I came back. I have 3 American degrees. I came back, I had applied to work (family pressure) then I was called to work for an ecommerce company. They saw my profile and for some reason attacked my degrees and my experience (i have experience in 3 different countries including nepal). After all thus, they offered me a 27k a month salary. Mind you, I was earning $2500 usd per month at another Asian country. After rejecting that offer, they re changed their offer to 40k. That used to be my rent btw. My family some how convinced me that 40k is good salary and I started working (big mistake).   Then I started my own company. We mainly do b2b work. My god, I must say, its the worst area to work in nepal. Its so damn difficult to get paid for the work done in this industry. We had about 60 clients and only 5 to 10 of them were good clients. Towards the end, we worked with a foreign affiliated college, which till date hasn't given us our money.   Then comes staff. After lock down, idk why but every one has been Uber frustrated. If they see a start up that is willing to change the business landscape of nepal, they were seen as \"sojo\". Staffs come up with bogus things to say and defame you.

Do something that makes you proud. Country will find its pride in your pride.   That being said, I moved abroad long ago by choice or for choices beyond my control. I could have lived a mid tier life back home.   I treat my entrepreneurial hustles like side projects. I experiment them. Let it out in public. If it sticks, i build on top of it. If not, I move on. And I get to do this because I moved to a place where I have time, money, freedom and exposure to solve hard problems that i find interesting.   Love for the land back home has not diminished, I get to talk shit because from afar I can see how shitty certain things are but it doesn’t mean I care less or love the place a little less.

What is your startup about?|||Hey stranger, just a heads up I don’t know you, and everything I say here comes purely from assumption and on good faith. Take what resonates, ignore the rest.  Honestly, bro… maybe it’s time to step back. You don’t owe anyone anything. I’m not sure what type of business this is, trading, a café, whatever, but ask yourself this: are you really making a difference for your country?  You can impact your country in ways you haven’t even imagined once you’re financially stable. If you’re struggling to run something that the country itself isn’t supporting, you’re burning the one life you’ve got. And if this is some groundbreaking idea, why not take it somewhere else where it can actually succeed? Imagine the pride of being a Nepali citizen who got things done, even from abroad, that’s genuine glory.  One life, bro. You owe it only to yourself and the family you’ll build one day and then your neighbors. Be honest with yourself: are you holding onto this under the guise of patriotism, when really it’s fear keeping you stuck? Comfort wears many masks.  Success doesn’t have to mean millions. It just means having what you need and want within reach, by your own standard. If running this business isn’t even giving you the bare minimum to live well, whether it’s the country’s system or your own effort, you owe it to yourself to rethink it.  Also, not to mention the way your post started. You might not be comparing your success to your friends’ success, or maybe you were just using that as an example of the country’s system, but I strongly feel it did make you a little salty, maybe even hurt. And that’s human.  But ask yourself this. Do you really want to stay stuck in a constant “what if”? Watching your co-founder or friends accomplish things right in front of your eyes while you hold onto the ideology of “my country needs me”? If that’s truly the path you choose, then fair enough. But otherwise, let the leaders do what’s necessary to create a country where the youth actually *want* to stay, without compromising people’s rights, of course.  At the end of the day, just appreciate this gift of life and make sure you’re not the one standing in the way of your own growth.

I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face.

So, try to ignore their behavior and move on. I do not know how else to put these into words.  I still keep in touch with some of my first students as they are very good kids.

I have had some difficult moments after classes as well, but a year more than in the classroom you get used to these and learn to tackle them.

You should probably resign tho, trying to fix those kids or ignoring them ain't worth the salary you're getting probably.|||The best thing that you can do at this time is to confront those students. Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more. You're at the position where you can take charge and stand up for yourself. Do it. Don't overthink, don't feel weak or embarrassed about it. You're their teacher and shaming, catcalling or just disrespecting teachers isn't good. You should stand up for this and for yourself. Let the students know that even though you're young, you can take charge and give them punishment. Okay. You're brave. You got this. 🫂|||Hi, I used to be a teacher in nepal. Have a very thick skin. Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment. It might come out very salty but maybe you lack experiences in discliplining a 14 year old because you yourself, you’re 18 and there’s no much of an age difference gap between you and your students. Being a teacher in Nepal isn’t easy with congested classrooms and poor ventilation.|||I always try to slip in some nice motivations or anecdotes about how being nice to other people is going to benefit yourself, and also prove it by rewarding good behaviour and respectful behaviour. I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Which class btw?

I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.",

Game is just Sandeep, Airee and pray.|||I have watched most of nepal’s match full, lets be realistic we don’t have technically sound players except Sandeep. We lack in all areas Tactics, Techinque, match awarness. There is a long way for us to go.|||Nepali players are physically as well as mentally weak, they look like 14 yo malnourished boys in front of other intl players  and they loose their nerves quite easily it seams|||I think the Italian team offered free Pizzas to all the Nepali batsmen and then the batsmen were too tired to bat. That's my only explanation.|||The expectations of the public is amazing. The team is still in its infancy, let cricket develop in the country and with that, the players will.   Im still proud of what this team achieved against england and shows how much better we have gotten.|||we were gashlighting them we dont have that much technical player, no player can hit sixes except few for the slower ball. look the italian player moving on crease against the spin its so good to see their technical abilities,now they are going to register the first win.hamrw fanbase dherai cha tei vayera gashlight garya lagcha k malai sometime ,we do lack skills ,we dont have power hitters|||Lack of exposure .    Also dal bhat power getting exposed |||Nepali team was never that good and Nepali cricket is overrated. we got lucky against England but still couldn't win. this was our bad day and we got punished. Italy did the same thing to UAE l a week ago. a team on par with Nepa btw. so, don't underestimate Italy they are a good side. both Italy and Nepal are decent associate sides. they played good today but we didn't.  here is how I see things. in T20 luck matters a lot. and if we look at the last 20-30 matches of Nepal. we won by very small margin. we never saw one Nepali player dominating with impressive performance. it's always. a few different players getting lucky. them scoring 20-30 runs each or some lucky bowling. and then getting enough to win by a lil margin. that shows to me that our players lack star talent. if we look at our results in longer formats like ODI.  where skills matter more, we suck even more.  I personally haven't bought our bowling is really great story either for a while now. our only decent bowler (by world cup standard) we have is Sandeep, everyone else is meh. I mean, we can't bowl fast bowls faster than 130s. Nandan is the only noticeable seamer, and he has a problem with accuracy with meh speeds. all other bowlers are meh in my eyes. I think airee can stay cool headed tho. people say we have good spinners. but if we look at the turns we get, out bowlers get less turn than other teams. and our spinners are slower as well. we have managed to do well sometimes with bowling against weaker sides. but with strong teams. we haven't shown the ability to be able to put pressure on the other team and they have destroyed us without losing a wicket more than once.  plus, I think our team lack good tactical understanding as well. I always see them making so many mistakes. like bruh why send karan to bowl in the end and not airee against england. or in the lokesh not trying to move around and try different shot. when curran threw all the bowls the same way.  I mean I am not someone who understands cricket that well. but to me it looked like today. our batsmen were confident and tried to play sixers. instead of our regular strength of running between the wickets and fours. and they didn't have enough skill and power for good placement or to clear the boundary. couple that with good italian strategy and fielder placements. and it was just bad day for out bowlers. funny how literally every shot was caught today, straight into the fielder's hand. it was goofy ash 😭|||Was hainw is|||Nepal has been playing same like this since day 1, just few miracles happens or then else we keep on playing in same form since Parash Khadka days. We should focus on our own league. International bejati|||Poor fielding. Poor shot selection.|||Nepal as a unit is bad. Lokesh is a miss and hit player. Look at his recent NPL performance. He scored in the first game then went silent. His whole carrer has been like that. Gulshan's role in the team is unknown. He neither bowls nor bats. We don't have a quality pacer. The team as a whole is bad|||Long time ago, I used to play in one of the Nepal National teams. We used to get chana, alu, 1 egg and jeri as special diet. We would run out of steam after every match. It feels like the same special diet has not changed. The final result -- they gave in their best last match. Now no energy left.|||We have serious discipline problem on batting. Jaslai aayera pani 6 nai hannu chha yaar.|||We hardly have a consistent batting lineup....non exsistent pace bowlers and overrated spinners....only good aspect is our fielding....yet our supporters have high hopes for these bunch of players......UAE Oman jasto lai easily beat garna sakdaina...tyai Qatar malaysia hongkong lai matra ho jitna sakne ......USA Canada even Italy haru kati progress gari sakyo hami chai 2004 mai NZ South Africa lai U19 ma jitera pani ajhai yo level mai chau|||We need to import players|||We, Nepalese, are habituated to settle for less and have zero tolerance to criticism. Not even a single player has performed consistently for a straight five games. We as a Nepali Fans have made Nepali Cricket and Nepali Cricket Players GOD like. Our criticism is childlike. We praise or criticize for just one game.   It’s a game but losing to Italy without taking any wicket shows our determination in the field. Looking at the past matches, approach to the game after a big hyped loss, we have underperformed. We accepted the loss with Italy right after our first inning, way before the first ball of second inning.   Our cricket has lost stories of passion in game after Paras Khadka Era.|||let's switch back to politics to get over with this humiliation.   k bhanney, kta haru le hagey ra aye yaar.|||Nepali players aren’t mature enough and not physically strong. They can’t control the game. Having said that, proud of the team and things will only get better with more money and public interest.|||Lack of practice? They’ve been burning taxpayers money touring India and other countries for practices. There is no discipline and consistency amongst the players.

If the test is positive then You can visit any hospital that has an Gynecology and Obstetrics Department. Or you can visit a Marie Stopes clinic near your. They provide abortion services and are experienced in handling these situations. you can probably get either a medical or surgical abortion. They might do an ultrasound to better determine the exact date. Medical abortion includes taking a pill or two and is usually an easier option. Surgical abortion is also a relatively minor procedure but it usually requires you to be admitted. Both of them are very safe when supervised by an experienced medical practitioner but like everything else, it also has risks. I would advice you to have a trusted friend with you during the process (doesn't need to be the guy as your consent is all that is needed for the procedure).|||Consult Marie stopes.

If you are not comfortable with going to the marrie stops center then seek help from the doctor ( medical officer/ gynaecologist) in private  hospital she/ he will examine and also recommend usg . And then according to the age of the fetus and the mother's health condition you will recommend medical termination or MVA or curettage. Do not take over the counter MTP drug as if the fetus is still in the tube,  it can cause rupture and that's a surgical emergency.|||Go get it checked out at your nearest (or farthest) marie stopes. I had been to the one in putalisadak.       Also, for your peace of mind, 4 days late is not too late and kits can be false too. Test a few times using kits from different brands. First morning pee is best.   And pretty sure this early stage ma if positive for sure, medication will work.|||Hi. Medical professional here. First and foremost do a urine pregnancy test. Use at least 2 different tests. Early morning mid stream urine is the best sample your partner can get. Since it’s been a month - your test results should be accurate ( read the instructions on the wrapper- if she’s pregnant ,2 lines should appear marked below C and T ) After that visit your nearest OBGYN doctor/clinic. Government hospitals and clinics are optional too. Marie Stopes is also a choice. It is very important you go to a professional and not just a pharmacy. An Ultrasonography ( USG ) - nepali ma video xray vancha - is a must which your doctor will recommend. It’s necessary to figure out where the fetus is implanted in your partner’s body or if it is an actual embryo as opposed to something else ( i.e - molar pregnancy ). If everything is as expected in the USG - you will be given an option for medical abortion or surgical ( D & C ) . They both have their pros and cons but a medical abortion ( taking pills ) would be relatively easier for your partner. After being prescribed, take the pills exactly as instructed and be by your partners side for a whole 24-48 hours. The physical pain and bleeding will be intense. She will require alot of re-assurance, support and rest. Fluids, hot water bags, pillows - things that will help her during this time. It might be tough on her mentally and emotionally as well. Your role as her man is important here. Be there for her every step of the way. Once the abortion is over ( she may feel like she passed a huge clot ) , the next step is to go for a follow up as the doctor has recommended. This is usually after 7 days. A USG will be required again to see if the products of conception have all been flushed out. Once again do NOT skip this step, it is very necessary for if the pills for some reason did not work as expected, a host of complications can happen. If the second USG report also shows up clear as intended-  pregnancy has been terminated.  Now , She will bleed for quite sometime after this as well ( approx 2 weeks after taking the pill ) it could go longer than that. If the bleeding is too long and too intense, go back for a checkup. If there’s any severe abdominal pain even after the abortion or fever, shivering, dizziness, feeling faint, severe nausea vomiting etc. during this process go to the ER immediately. Very important. Also Do not hesitate to ask your doctor during any visit , anything that you are unsure or unaware of and never feel ashamed or uncomfortable in your decision. I have not elaborated on other possibilities like an ectopic/ molar pregnancy as if thats the case then its best to hear it from your consulting physician and follow their advice. What i’ve explained above is what you could expect if your partner has a normal pregnancy and medical abortion so that you are re-assured about the whole experience. My best wishes to you both . Good luck|||Don't panic.

Although how they play out in the actual reality is yet to be seen, hindu population in this country voted for BNP by huge margins, BNP has \"tried\" to show itself as the leftist even recognizing atheists that previous govts never did to get the minority votes and this got them the historic win.  NCP is the party that the youth are most hopeful about. They got 5 key seats but in a country of that big of a population you need more than a year to get a huge fanbase. Winning over the youth is not the same as winning farmers in far bordered districts. Urbal liberals and students dominanty support NCP but voted bnp this year because they were more about AGAINST jamaat than FOR NCP. Thanks.

Scrap government sites with your AI agent , gather information on frequently appearing government tasks and put it online. Make your AI agent work.

You have to do every process very silently until the visa is confirmed.|||Since you are showing your work experience, not only your university, there is also a chance that the Australian High Commission may see it as proof to cover your study gap.  Normally, employers should inform you by email or any other way if you break any rules, unless it’s something illegal. If you haven’t done anything against company policy, firing you just because they found out you are planning to study abroad might be against the law.  Try to talk to them politely first. If they don’t understand, then you can politely warn them that you may file a complaint in the labor court. If it’s a reputed or growing company, you can also tell them you might raise the issue on social media, which could affect their reputation.  Basically, do some research about labor law in Nepal, and make sure you stay polite even if you are warning them. You may need an experience letter or some proof of work in the future. Or maybe they will understand and let you continue working until your visa is granted.|||chutiyaa company raichha ... you can file a case in labour court but don't do it cause it will waste your time ... it looks like it wasn't a permanent job ... so just chill and proceed with your university   do inform the university that you got fired and it's nothing wrong with university procedures... it's the shitty employer of yours.|||Thank them for removing distraction.|||1.

But to my surprise, I was the only UI/UX there.  As a beginner, my designs were inconsistent, like uneven spacing and all. The CTO used to check whether the spacing is even or not using a damn RULER, on a LAPTOP SCREEN. I thought that was normal, until it wasn't.  Overtime was so normalized in the office. CTO used to always come for design reviews sharp at 6 or after, and expected me to make the changes on the spot.  Sometimes the changes implementations used to exceed 7. Being a student, I told them so many times that I need to get off the work on time for studies and assignments, but they didn't give a damn.  The pay was less than basic. The first 3 months were 6k, then another 3 were 10k, and after that it was 15k. They used to act as if they were doing us favours by paying us.  Now you can often see ad of vacanies like this on insta.

Yeah, right, CAUSE NOBODY CAN SURVIVE THEIR TOXIC ENVIRONMENT.  They will be having the vacancies for social media intern every now and then cause yeah koi tikdai tikdaina. They laid off two of their SEO Executives, stating \"they don't need SEO anymore,\" and walla opens vacancies for SEO a few months after.

I will be 24 years old soon, but still a bachelor's.|||If i were in your situation I'd be looking multiple ways to earn money. Maybe try exploring the markets.

So, in working in a startup, it's better to take on more responsibilities as possible, i.e. being involved in as many projects as possible. Learning how to handle pressure at times needed in prod, and being able to scale and optimize ( for a software engineer ), and keep honing them  English communication skills. That way, experience is built and eventually, getting a remote job would be imminent. There, you will be replicating the same hustle, same stack even, and same pressure, the only difference would be that the clients would be valueable and be worth while, ( unlike the typical nepali tech culture that leeches you off of your efforts and don't see you as a person but a part of the organization( machine ) to make things happen and pay the bare minimum). Just that , with good clients( international ), their bare minimum might be the answer to \"how much money you wished you earned here in Nepal that would make you not want to apply to go abroads \".   Keep working, keep stacking them experience and keep producing. Remember, people are lazy by default and want to do the bare minimum and get the best results. So, you have a way there to get an edge over other people by just realizing that. And, for now, focus on more projects and your road to becoming a senior engineer as soon as possible ( AI takes junior to mid = real ). Ask people what it means for them to be a good engineer and senior engineer.   All this aside, gotta admit that luck also plays a huge favor in alignment. So, keep working on getting yourself in position for that. Don't feel like an imposter if you can't be consistent sometimes. It's only human.  And also,  you are pretty young to be worrying about all this ( which is a good sign ). I am 26 , worked for 2 years at that salary ( with a 50 % bump due to good communication skills ( read \"how to make friends and influence people\" waala book ) with the stakeholders ) and got my break of remote work. I don't feel old. I feel like the youngest version of me that will ever be, looking forward. While I know that there will be friction in the state of mind when there is uncertainty and stagnancy in a place, also know to consider that your future self is well off anyway, and so can view this as the struggle phase, which only makes one appreciate the value of tranquility later even more when you do get it.   Also, while most of this sounds like motivation porn ( added with personal experience ), I hope mother luck is on the side of the OP 's side!   Bro, you got this !|||Bro, take a breath. You’re 22  not 42.  If I were you, I wouldn’t rush abroad just because of pressure. Australia is not a magic solution. It’s mostly:   Big education loan   Part-time survival jobs at first   Study + work stress   PR uncertainty   Mental pressure (especially if you already had anxiety)  Yes, you can repay loans during Masters if things go well. But “if things go well” is the key. Many students struggle more mentally than financially.  Right now you’re a software dev. That’s powerful. Tech rewards skill, not location only. If I were you, I would:  1. Spend 1–2 years can seriously upgrading skills. 2. Switch to higher-paying remote or international company. 3. Increase income to 80k–1L+ before thinking abroad. 4. Clear current loan first.  Going abroad should be a strategic move, not an escape from feeling behind.  You’re not late. 22 is literally the beginning. Marriage pressure and “clock is ticking” thoughts are social noise.  Stability + skill growth + mental health > rushed foreign loan.  Don’t make a 20-lakh decision from a 2-month anxiety wave.",

These founders are fleeing the West because of high costs. They are looking for places with:  1. High-speed, reliable internet (Starlink/Fiber). 2. Inspiring nature/environment. 3. **Low Cost of Living.**  Nepal fits the bill perfectly for 2 and 3.

Best use it between 40% to 60% charge You can set this via vendor apps like MSI center, armory crate, etc 3. Never use it at low battery percentage and never retain battery at full charge.  4. Battery needs cool environment, so give it better ventilation and airflow|||What actually damages the battery is the charging cycle. So you should use your laptop while plugged in and also limit max battery to around 80% (if your laptop has this feature)|||I have added a battery charge limit to 80%(my laptop allows it), and i always plug it in while using.   It performs the best this way. It used to heat up when it used to be in charging state(below 80%, as it needs to climb to 80% and it has fast charging), since i always plug it in, it does not heat up and remains 80% all the time, and it also helps if there is power outage.  Since the battery is mostly at 80%, it’s less likely to wear out or degrade as quickly.|||For me , the charge is on and connected 24/7. You might say making 100 percent charge is not good and you are correct that's why my charger limits charge at 80 percent,never charges above it and charging starts after 30 percent.

What do you think happens next. A random unstable  guy starts touching females and he has every room to defend by claiming she made a slur comments ? Or anyone can go and beat the shit out of anyone due to personal revenge and can flee away by saying he/she made slur comments ?

Call the police, that's all. There are laws against verbal abuse.  According to your logic, a family member of a deceased person should have the right to kill two people of the murderer.  Currently, we do not have a \"tit-for-tat\" law. Even if this law existed, I am quite sure the law itself would decide it, not the people involved.

We should not have mob justice.   Unfortunately, our law and order system is so weak that people resort to violence.

Learn to read the game ( calculate overs left, the way pitch is, look how the bowlers are bowling based on field position and take occasional risk by moving in the pitch).  No need to be over hyped and play reckless shot to be a hero. Play smart.  To be less critic, most of the developed teams come up off a well structured cricket scenario. They are taught these basics through different level of games that they play in. Nepal lacks these structures.   Additionally Nepalese lack the physique and strength to clear boundaries so we need to learn to be composed and learn play to our strength. Fast bowls are relatively easy to hit as it comes at pace, spin and slow cutters need bodily strength. A difference seen in between ours and 🇮🇹 innings. They moved around the pitch when Nepal was bowling straight, had power to clear.  Too much can be said, the players are obviously smart to understand this but need to implement it in their mindset. Raw energy can make miracles happen but consistency comes from a calm mindset and smart decision making. This was the difference between us and italy.|||Kei ni thik xaina k hamro team ko tait dui tinta hit lagyo  ani hype ma aako player jasto vayo aile eauta bowler xaina jasle ma yo ball falxu vanera tei falna sakxa jasto jastai ma yorker falxu vanera short pitch falni bowler haru xa Ani batsmen haruni asti hype ma aayo ani six hanna parxa aba maile vanera jabarjasti shot kheliraxa chauka hanni vaneko misplace vara ho kasaile maile yo shot khelxu yo gapma khelxu vanera kheleko dekhina maile  Ani arko vaneko decision match khelna vanda agadi study garxa jasto ni lagena malai opponent ko asti Eng saga pani spin khelna garo manirathyo karan lai dira last over testo ni garxa yr kasaile  Ani vanna sajilo xa vanlau haina thaxa sajilo xa tara hamro local team le india bata bolauthem aaira hunthyo khai biharko b c kun team haru khelna, yo vanda hamrai team ramro thyo jasto lagxa aileherda kheri  Yesto serious discussion hunthyo yr sab situation calculation garera rakhthem aggilo dinmai toss jityo vani yo garni haryo vani yo target kati pauda k garni mausam herthem swing khanxa ki nai vandai eauta local tournament ma ta ani aafno desh ko halat hawa xa ghartira khelejasto k j hunxa hunxa vanera hidejasto khelna pani,chittai dukhera aayo yr tait :(|||Asti England ko game ko performance herda ta aaja 200+ huney thiyo, khulit parey.

I am positive this thought has NEVER, EVER crossed his mind.   From a naive implementation point of view, the solution is simple. However, in case of Nepal, it is very difficult. Firstly, we need proper drainage in our streets. The water needs to go from the streets to the river somehow. So many things need to align for this to happen. Firstly, we need to know how much water we are talking. For this we need climate modeling for the next fifty or a hundred years. Then, we need to right size the culverts or whatever. We need to cut up streets, add this drainage, and cover again.   There comes our biggest challenge. Our corruption rate is too high. Chuhawat should be less than 1 or 2% maximum of project total. Our leakage rate is too high. in such a scenario, there is no trust by the people that the work done is actually standard and not substandard, shoddy work.   Even if you somehow manage to do all of this, next you need to educate and convince people to not dump household waste into this new drainage system. This drains directly into the river, don't pee here, don't poop here, don't throw the water after you do wash your clothes here, etc. How? Who will enforce this?   In any case, I guess I wrote this longwinded thing to say it isn't easy to solve this problem in Nepal.",

            "body": "Hi everyone,   let us introduce our self. We are Cerulearn, an ed tech company that is on its way to revolutionize education. At the moment, we have a small community of educators and learners who are thriving to become a better version of our selves. I will share a small info about us bellow:  While growing up, the creators of Cerulearn had a difficult time either focusing in class, or were not satisfied with the course work. When both were “self studying”, they often faced many challenges. That is when both wanted an app that would revolutionize the education landscape. The global education landscape is undergoing a transformation. Hybrid and remote learning are now a norm, and students are demanding more personalized support. Traditional e-learning tools often feel static and disconnected. Cerulearn steps in with a dynamic, AI-first approach that brings course materials to life, supports learners on their terms, and gives institutions the insight they need to drive better outcomes.  To better understand us, you can find us on different social media platforms. We also recently saw that a lot of students are confused on what to do after 10th or 12th grade, so we made a video on it. If you like to get a 1 on 1 consultation (its a free consultation), you can DM us on any of our socials or visit us at our website: [www.ceruai.com](http://www.ceruai.com) .   I hope the moderators are able to post this, as it promotional as well as educational post.     regards,      Cerulearn team. [Cerulearn](http://www.ceruai.com)",

Certain lines feel increasingly relevant in today’s digital age:  अचम्म ! छौ बजारमा ? यहाँ कसोरि छौ तिमी ? विशाल सृष्टि–वल्लरी प्रफल्ल एक पुष्प ए ? म सोध्छु ए ! विचित्रकी तरङ्ग ! वृत्ति–बावली ! मभित्र बज्छ बाँसुरी, मिहीन औ पुरानिया !  The image of something delicate and unique standing in the marketplace feels symbolic. In many ways, it reflects the modern digital content economy, where personal space and identity can become commodities in exchange for visibility and validation.  This is not a criticism of content creation itself. Expression is powerful and necessary. Yet the constant pursuit of attention and dopamine can push individuals to gradually blur their own boundaries.  What once resonated in a literal sense now also resonates digitally. The poem’s question remains timeless: what happens when something sacred enters the market?|||Enjoyed it 👏👏|||just amazing!  |||fyi devkota plagiarized newa folk tale to write muna madan ",

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism.

The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

All these comments from more experienced peoples make me nervous.   Life is mostly running fine until I compare it with friends outside. They earn at least 5 lacs per monthe, some have $100k+ package. Ofcourse earning here is shit compared to what it is outside. But if I didn't know these things, i would have always thought that my business is running good and m earning well    I always think about our parent's time. When they used to work, their earning was never how much we can earn in jobs these days. But they were never this concerned about how much they could earn if they moved outside. Its all social media life style and comparison now.   Plus nobody outside will tell you how much they struggle, and how they feel far away from their family.   I might be less experienced than you guys, or haven't faced that level of problems, still will advice to stop comparing with others.|||Reflect on your past 6 years. I'm sure they've been horrendous are you progressing? I don't just mean money but knowledge and networking.  It usually takes 5-10 years in the game to finally start making money from being an entrepreneur in Nepal. But unfortunately most people realize this isn't what they want to do.  If you still have genuine hope, strive on. Most of your competition has quit or are in their infancy stages while you have 6 years under your belt.|||I feel this post deeply.  I work in a software company as a Sales Manager, and I’ve had the exact same thoughts recently. Especially after I had a daughter. When you become a parent, the whole “stay and build the country” dream suddenly competes with “can I give my child stability and security?”  I also started a small company on the side (xyz). It’s not easy. Market is slow, payments get delayed, policies change, and sometimes it feels like the system tests your patience more than your skills. Meanwhile, friends abroad are buying cars, saving money, living structured lives with predictable systems.  I’ve made a personal deal with myself ; I’ll try here seriously until I’m 39. If I succeed, great. If I fail, I won’t let ego stop me from leaving. I don’t see leaving as betrayal anymore. I see it as strategy.  Staying is meaningful. But it should not cost your mental health, your family’s future, or your dignity.  The real question isn’t “Is leaving right?”   It’s “Are you growing, stable, and respected where you are?”  If yes : stay and build.   If no : maybe your impact just needs a different geography.  Whatever you choose, make sure it’s driven by long-term clarity, not temporary frustration.|||After living abroad for 10 years, I came back. I have 3 American degrees. I came back, I had applied to work (family pressure) then I was called to work for an ecommerce company. They saw my profile and for some reason attacked my degrees and my experience (i have experience in 3 different countries including nepal). After all thus, they offered me a 27k a month salary. Mind you, I was earning $2500 usd per month at another Asian country. After rejecting that offer, they re changed their offer to 40k. That used to be my rent btw. My family some how convinced me that 40k is good salary and I started working (big mistake).   Then I started my own company. We mainly do b2b work. My god, I must say, its the worst area to work in nepal. Its so damn difficult to get paid for the work done in this industry. We had about 60 clients and only 5 to 10 of them were good clients. Towards the end, we worked with a foreign affiliated college, which till date hasn't given us our money.   Then comes staff. After lock down, idk why but every one has been Uber frustrated.

Do something that makes you proud. Country will find its pride in your pride.   That being said, I moved abroad long ago by choice or for choices beyond my control. I could have lived a mid tier life back home.   I treat my entrepreneurial hustles like side projects. I experiment them. Let it out in public. If it sticks, i build on top of it. If not, I move on. And I get to do this because I moved to a place where I have time, money, freedom and exposure to solve hard problems that i find interesting.

What is your startup about?|||Hey stranger, just a heads up I don’t know you, and everything I say here comes purely from assumption and on good faith. Take what resonates, ignore the rest.  Honestly, bro… maybe it’s time to step back. You don’t owe anyone anything. I’m not sure what type of business this is, trading, a café, whatever, but ask yourself this: are you really making a difference for your country?  You can impact your country in ways you haven’t even imagined once you’re financially stable. If you’re struggling to run something that the country itself isn’t supporting, you’re burning the one life you’ve got. And if this is some groundbreaking idea, why not take it somewhere else where it can actually succeed? Imagine the pride of being a Nepali citizen who got things done, even from abroad, that’s genuine glory.  One life, bro. You owe it only to yourself and the family you’ll build one day and then your neighbors. Be honest with yourself: are you holding onto this under the guise of patriotism, when really it’s fear keeping you stuck? Comfort wears many masks.  Success doesn’t have to mean millions. It just means having what you need and want within reach, by your own standard. If running this business isn’t even giving you the bare minimum to live well, whether it’s the country’s system or your own effort, you owe it to yourself to rethink it.  Also, not to mention the way your post started. You might not be comparing your success to your friends’ success, or maybe you were just using that as an example of the country’s system, but I strongly feel it did make you a little salty, maybe even hurt. And that’s human.  But ask yourself this. Do you really want to stay stuck in a constant “what if”? Watching your co-founder or friends accomplish things right in front of your eyes while you hold onto the ideology of “my country needs me”? If that’s truly the path you choose, then fair enough. But otherwise, let the leaders do what’s necessary to create a country where the youth actually *want* to stay, without compromising people’s rights, of course.  At the end of the day, just appreciate this gift of life and make sure you’re not the one standing in the way of your own growth.

I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face.

So, try to ignore their behavior and move on. I do not know how else to put these into words.  I still keep in touch with some of my first students as they are very good kids. They reach out to me for career guidance and such. If they truly respect you and understand the value you bring, it will show up later as well.  Don't get demotivated and try to push through. I have had some difficult moments after classes as well, but a year more than in the classroom you get used to these and learn to tackle them.

It must be hard for you cause students only realise these stuff were wrong after they grow up, some don't even although.   You should probably resign tho, trying to fix those kids or ignoring them ain't worth the salary you're getting probably.|||The best thing that you can do at this time is to confront those students. Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more. You're at the position where you can take charge and stand up for yourself. Do it. Don't overthink, don't feel weak or embarrassed about it. You're their teacher and shaming, catcalling or just disrespecting teachers isn't good. You should stand up for this and for yourself. Let the students know that even though you're young, you can take charge and give them punishment. Okay. You're brave. You got this. 🫂|||Hi, I used to be a teacher in nepal. Have a very thick skin. Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment. It might come out very salty but maybe you lack experiences in discliplining a 14 year old because you yourself, you’re 18 and there’s no much of an age difference gap between you and your students.

I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Which class btw?

I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.",

He has the highest chance to represent Nepal on international stage only and only if the government focuses on the development of football.  While it’s good to let him develop without any pressure and highlights but I also think he deserves to be known by all the Nepali football supporters .

At least you are building something useful rather than AI generated slop people waste tokens on.    My observations and suggestions :    1. open source the code.    2. Enable markdown contributions , flat files as content / tasks source. This will make the contributions easy for developers (and their AI agents 👀 ) for contributing directly to the codebase.   3. The contribution ui/ux is Time consuming I guess. Lots of information to fill out.    4. The overall ui/ux needs a full-blown upgrade ( which will naturally happen as project grows, needs ux rethinking though i.e driven by ux and usefulness from the perspective of information seeker \\[emphasis on proper easy navigation and better readability\\] )   5. Scrap government sites with your AI agent , gather information on frequently appearing government tasks and put it online. Make your AI agent work. I will suggest poking around with antigarvity's browser agent.   6.

The company is still early-stage, and a lot of the system and technical decisions currently depend on me.

I didn’t actively plan to leave; this opportunity came unexpectedly.  For people working in tech in Nepal:  * Is leaving after 4 months a bad move? * Would you prioritize the salary jump and international exposure? * How would you handle this situation professionally?  Looking for honest opinions and personal experiences. Thanks!",

OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.

You have to do every process very silently until the visa is confirmed.|||Since you are showing your work experience, not only your university, there is also a chance that the Australian High Commission may see it as proof to cover your study gap.  Normally, employers should inform you by email or any other way if you break any rules, unless it’s something illegal. If you haven’t done anything against company policy, firing you just because they found out you are planning to study abroad might be against the law.  Try to talk to them politely first. If they don’t understand, then you can politely warn them that you may file a complaint in the labor court. If it’s a reputed or growing company, you can also tell them you might raise the issue on social media, which could affect their reputation.  Basically, do some research about labor law in Nepal, and make sure you stay polite even if you are warning them. You may need an experience letter or some proof of work in the future. Or maybe they will understand and let you continue working until your visa is granted.|||chutiyaa company raichha ... you can file a case in labour court but don't do it cause it will waste your time ... it looks like it wasn't a permanent job ... so just chill and proceed with your university   do inform the university that you got fired and it's nothing wrong with university procedures... it's the shitty employer of yours.|||Thank them for removing distraction.|||1.

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?

What do you think happens next. A random unstable  guy starts touching females and he has every room to defend by claiming she made a slur comments ? Or anyone can go and beat the shit out of anyone due to personal revenge and can flee away by saying he/she made slur comments ?  If that guy was in right state of mind he would classify that guy as a unstable person go to the police station and pour all his frustuation in taking away that guy from that street to better facility so that he doesnt do same thing to other people.

Flowers? i can maybe tara it has to be accompanied with something! Self made gifts are my forte tara wouldn't it be tiring for him? Ahhhhh.

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.|||[removed]|||Tourism is never good for economic growth in Country, see Thailand as they grow at 2% every year despite having so Tourist for that they have literally convert the whole country into a PUB",

Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me. The mayor of Pokhara, in my view, represents everything that’s wrong with corruption in Nepal.

When you walk into a room full of people, everyone thinks about how you look, dress, walk, and talk, but the exact opposite happens in reality.  When you enter a room, your mind tricks you into thinking you’re the center of attention, but in reality, you become invisible to everyone.  Here’s how:  Just like you overthink what others are noticing about you, they’re overthinking the same about themselves.   You don’t easily notice these things in their body language, and they don’t notice yours either.  In simple terms, there is no audience to perform for, and no one is really watching. You can just walk like you own the room.  For introverts, this idea can be life changing. You’re allowed to exist as you are.  Just a reminder: the biggest battle is always with the voice in your head. Everyone is insecure about something, and most are wearing masks to hide their flaws.

I work in a software company as a Sales Manager, and I’ve had the exact same thoughts recently. Especially after I had a daughter. When you become a parent, the whole “stay and build the country” dream suddenly competes with “can I give my child stability and security?”  I also started a small company on the side (xyz). It’s not easy. Market is slow, payments get delayed, policies change, and sometimes it feels like the system tests your patience more than your skills. Meanwhile, friends abroad are buying cars, saving money, living structured lives with predictable systems.  I’ve made a personal deal with myself ; I’ll try here seriously until I’m 39. If I succeed, great. If I fail, I won’t let ego stop me from leaving. I don’t see leaving as betrayal anymore. I see it as strategy.  Staying is meaningful. But it should not cost your mental health, your family’s future, or your dignity.  The real question isn’t “Is leaving right?”   It’s “Are you growing, stable, and respected where you are?”  If yes : stay and build.   If no : maybe your impact just needs a different geography.

What is your startup about?|||Hey stranger, just a heads up I don’t know you, and everything I say here comes purely from assumption and on good faith. Take what resonates, ignore the rest.  Honestly, bro… maybe it’s time to step back. You don’t owe anyone anything. I’m not sure what type of business this is, trading, a café, whatever, but ask yourself this: are you really making a difference for your country?  You can impact your country in ways you haven’t even imagined once you’re financially stable. If you’re struggling to run something that the country itself isn’t supporting, you’re burning the one life you’ve got. And if this is some groundbreaking idea, why not take it somewhere else where it can actually succeed? Imagine the pride of being a Nepali citizen who got things done, even from abroad, that’s genuine glory.  One life, bro. You owe it only to yourself and the family you’ll build one day and then your neighbors. Be honest with yourself: are you holding onto this under the guise of patriotism, when really it’s fear keeping you stuck? Comfort wears many masks.  Success doesn’t have to mean millions. It just means having what you need and want within reach, by your own standard. If running this business isn’t even giving you the bare minimum to live well, whether it’s the country’s system or your own effort, you owe it to yourself to rethink it.  Also, not to mention the way your post started. You might not be comparing your success to your friends’ success, or maybe you were just using that as an example of the country’s system, but I strongly feel it did make you a little salty, maybe even hurt. And that’s human.  But ask yourself this. Do you really want to stay stuck in a constant “what if”? Watching your co-founder or friends accomplish things right in front of your eyes while you hold onto the ideology of “my country needs me”? If that’s truly the path you choose, then fair enough. But otherwise, let the leaders do what’s necessary to create a country where the youth actually *want* to stay, without compromising people’s rights, of course.  At the end of the day, just appreciate this gift of life and make sure you’re not the one standing in the way of your own growth.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

When I was a student, especially in school, I remember boys in my class making vile, disgusting comments about our female teachers, about the bras they wore, about how “fat” they were, even about what they imagined those teachers did with their husbands in bed. I used to think teachers were clueless, that they couldn’t possibly hear the whispers, the laughter, the mockery. I even confronted some boys once, telling them to stop because those were our teachers. But deep down, I still believed the teachers didn’t really know. Now I know the truth, they hear everything. Because now, I hear everything.  I’ve been catcalled by my own students. I’ve overheard one of them telling his friend that I had a “big ass,” and I remember standing there completely frozen, my mind blank, my body refusing to move. I’ve heard them sexualize me, reduce me to my body, mock me, compare me to a buffalo, call me fat, all while sitting in a classroom where I’m supposed to be respected. When I tried to confront them once, they dismissed me and said I “heard it wrong,” as if I was imagining the humiliation. The denial almost hurt more than the words. Today, after my last period, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut the classroom door and came straight home, crying, feeling so small and degraded that I didn’t even recognize myself. The irony is painful, I once thought teachers were unaffected, that teasing just rolled off their backs. Now I realize they probably stood there, just like I do, swallowing the humiliation in silence. And what makes it worse is knowing this job isn’t even high-paying, yet it demands you endure this kind of disrespect with a straight face. I never thought I would stand on this side of the desk and feel this broken.",

I mostly teach college kids and they are somehow well-behaved than younger kids out there.  Something I would not say out loud but I keep telling myself as a coping mechanism is that these kids will not stay in your life forever. You are not supposed to look out for them forever either. So, try to ignore their behavior and move on. I do not know how else to put these into words.  I still keep in touch with some of my first students as they are very good kids. They reach out to me for career guidance and such. If they truly respect you and understand the value you bring, it will show up later as well.  Don't get demotivated and try to push through. I have had some difficult moments after classes as well, but a year more than in the classroom you get used to these and learn to tackle them. You might also want to look into things like having some authority in classroom and educational psychology. The latter helped me understand things a bit.  That's all I can say. Good luck with everything. |||[deleted]|||Resign.

It must be hard for you cause students only realise these stuff were wrong after they grow up, some don't even although.   You should probably resign tho, trying to fix those kids or ignoring them ain't worth the salary you're getting probably.|||The best thing that you can do at this time is to confront those students. Make them feel guilty about their behavior. Tell about this to the Principal and call the parents of the students. You're young. Hearing such things is so so bad. And tolerating is even more. You're at the position where you can take charge and stand up for yourself. Do it. Don't overthink, don't feel weak or embarrassed about it. You're their teacher and shaming, catcalling or just disrespecting teachers isn't good. You should stand up for this and for yourself. Let the students know that even though you're young, you can take charge and give them punishment. Okay. You're brave. You got this. 🫂|||Hi, I used to be a teacher in nepal. Have a very thick skin. Discipline them. I mean you’re just 18, be relatable and cool and not uptight and traditional. Be professional, smell nice. And if you hear a comment like that, make them stand up and ask them to repeat what they just said and see how the entire classroom goes silent. Make them fear you without imposing any physical punishment. It might come out very salty but maybe you lack experiences in discliplining a 14 year old because you yourself, you’re 18 and there’s no much of an age difference gap between you and your students. Being a teacher in Nepal isn’t easy with congested classrooms and poor ventilation.|||I always try to slip in some nice motivations or anecdotes about how being nice to other people is going to benefit yourself, and also prove it by rewarding good behaviour and respectful behaviour. I used to have the same problem but once I started rewarding the nice comments my students make and make my classroom a more calm, loving and caring environment, I noticed my students messing around less and actually being more respectful to each other because I was under their watch and they wanted my validation and approval of their good behaviour so they can be rewarded (maybe with a sticker/candy or any merits, especially if you can be the one to tell their parents directly of their improvements in the class)|||Which class btw?

I started teaching CTEVT when I was 22 (after my bachelor's). And though there was some difficulty at the beginning, it was actually very enjoyable afterwards.   When I first went to class, students would try to one up on me (some of the students were older than me so they looked down on me), they would eat in class thinking we don't see them, they would say things like \"yeslai padauna ta aauncha ni\" , etc). But you need to learn to establish authority. Once you make it clear that you are the one who controls the class and you are there to just help them, they become more modest and might even help you afterwards.    What I did was remember all their names before I even entered the classroom. As you said , the teacher are aware of the classroom, we immediately know the troublesome students. Don't confront them with personal stuff but immediately punish them if they do sth wrong or else they will continue doing it. Always call them by their name directly pointing at them. Everyday after I entered the classroom I would make the really good students stand up and ask them difficult subject related questions (they are almost always eager to show their knowledge and this also shows other students your authority) then slowly you move to weak troublesome students (ask them easier questions that they can answer or make them read sth) this motivates them and they will be more willing to listen to you. Or if they do sth wrong, ask them questions they can't answer. This subconsciously trains them that they will be rewarded or punished for their actions.",

In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

At least you are building something useful rather than AI generated slop people waste tokens on.    My observations and suggestions :    1. open source the code.    2. Enable markdown contributions , flat files as content / tasks source. This will make the contributions easy for developers (and their AI agents 👀 ) for contributing directly to the codebase.   3. The contribution ui/ux is Time consuming I guess. Lots of information to fill out.    4. The overall ui/ux needs a full-blown upgrade ( which will naturally happen as project grows, needs ux rethinking though i.e driven by ux and usefulness from the perspective of information seeker \\[emphasis on proper easy navigation and better readability\\] )   5. Scrap government sites with your AI agent , gather information on frequently appearing government tasks and put it online. Make your AI agent work. I will suggest poking around with antigarvity's browser agent.   6.

            "body": "Hi everyone,  I’m a software engineer working in Nepal. I joined a local startup as a Technical Lead about 4 months ago. The company is still early-stage, and a lot of the system and technical decisions currently depend on me.  Recently, I received a full-time remote offer from a foreign company offering more than **double my current salary** (paid in USD).  Current situation:  * Current net salary: \\~NPR 90,000/month ( Gross 115000) * New offer: \\~$1800/month (2lakhs46thousands) * No equity in current company * Contract notice period: 2 months * New role: same level (Tech Lead), full-time remote  I feel conflicted because:  * It’s only been 4 months since I joined * The startup relies heavily on me * But the financial jump is significant * The new job starts in about 40 days, I cant complete my full notice period here.  I didn’t actively plan to leave; this opportunity came unexpectedly.  For people working in tech in Nepal:  * Is leaving after 4 months a bad move? * Would you prioritize the salary jump and international exposure? * How would you handle this situation professionally?  Looking for honest opinions and personal experiences. Thanks!",

Ssf ma ki k 😂|||Try to negotiate the notice period and make the switch. The value in the remote work will be more than your current role. If you really do matter to the company, they will try to make adjustments. It's not only a salary jump on your new role. It is much more|||You can get someone to fill your role. Another developer, may be someone in your network, or may be me if I am qualified😆 Train s/he and leave for another opportunity.. this is a huge jump, if you were lead in my company, I would understand, in fact I would prefer if you take the new offer. But I would be grateful if you gave new lead some support during transition.|||I am working for foreign company for around 3 years now. I too felt the same as you are feeling now when I switched my job. 1800 USD is really good offer. Don't miss this opportunity !! Foreign job comes with remote is the best. U only have to pay 5% tax flat. You will have more money which will motivate you !!|||if the start up heavily depend on you then ask for big equity and if you belive the startup's  scope and future than stay here with company and family with the equity else begin new journey|||if 2x then switch. i would have said don't switch if it is just 25% more.|||Handle the local company as a consultant (part time ) if they agree because they heavily depend on on you. Keep the relationship on good terms. So during the time help them transition so it works both ways.   Since the other offer is remote, you can easily manage time with both, if you can handle both good for you or leave the local and continue with the foreign one.|||Switch switch. No second thoughts needed , better pay probably better technology, flexibility of working from home and international exposure. Communicate properly that you've gotten a better opportunity and will take that. Since you have been there for only 4 months, your knowledge and dependency can be transferred and even if they force you to stay for 60 days, maybe for the last 20 days do part time but only for handover and knowledge transfer.|||I dont think 2 months notice period is enforceable. Check labor law of Nepal.|||Just remember Nepali rupee is losing its value from time to time if I were you I would put that usd salary in a dollar account or other option would be if your startup offers you equity otherwise I would leave and you should also be aware that the new position opens up other kinds of doors.|||Startup work culture and future can be a good career choice in the long run (regardless of your better US offer situation).     MY ADVICE:      1) Ask for reasonable equity in the startup (long-term vesting schedule can be a good option) and stay if you believe in the product / company direction.  OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.  PS. Source: me (Tech/Mgmt Consultant), who worked with PE/VC funds and startups in Nepali tech, where issues of equity and valuation comes up frequently.|||https://i.redd.it/wezhrkoxwnhg1.gif|||Fuck professionalism. Better pay is better pay. Imagine the company was going through budget cuts and you were not in the budget. What would the company do?|||Any company won't think twice if they have to let you go in future.  If the salary is good and you like the nature of work, definitely switch it.|||Share me the years of experience I need in Nepal for such salary.|||Twice the salary is not a joke. Thats 100% more money you can invest and half the amount you need to work in your life. You should take it.   Just to be sure, do find out how the work culture in new office is.|||SWITCH|||the decision is obvious. you're way underpayed for a tech lead too. juniors nowadays make north of \\~60k.|||Jump before you will regret. But again you have a wonderful opportunity to build from scratch in the startup.  If you want to resign, talk with them and be transparent. It will be easy if you don’t lie.|||Take the new job. Say you can work as a consultant for the startup but can't do full time.|||I switched rightway tbh, I had two years contract, they didn't pay my PF  I didnt care.  I am very happy with my decision back then.|||Just make the switch. You current company will fire your without thinking twice if it suited their needs so why should you care about the company.

Switch|||think of you not the company!! Grow up man|||I would definitely switch it.|||I mean is there even a question?|||bro you match almost all the stats. why does it feel like you and I work in the same company? 😅|||Go for it.   1. No.   2. Yes and yes.   3. Tell your current employer that you have got this new job that is offering you this and that. And leave on a good note.   You should not think twice. Opportunity doesn’t always come handy.|||Tech lead and only 90k salary?

You have to do every process very silently until the visa is confirmed.|||Since you are showing your work experience, not only your university, there is also a chance that the Australian High Commission may see it as proof to cover your study gap.  Normally, employers should inform you by email or any other way if you break any rules, unless it’s something illegal. If you haven’t done anything against company policy, firing you just because they found out you are planning to study abroad might be against the law.  Try to talk to them politely first. If they don’t understand, then you can politely warn them that you may file a complaint in the labor court. If it’s a reputed or growing company, you can also tell them you might raise the issue on social media, which could affect their reputation.  Basically, do some research about labor law in Nepal, and make sure you stay polite even if you are warning them. You may need an experience letter or some proof of work in the future. Or maybe they will understand and let you continue working until your visa is granted.|||chutiyaa company raichha ... you can file a case in labour court but don't do it cause it will waste your time ... it looks like it wasn't a permanent job ... so just chill and proceed with your university   do inform the university that you got fired and it's nothing wrong with university procedures... it's the shitty employer of yours.|||Thank them for removing distraction.|||1.

Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

I’d cut it down to one page, keep just 2–3 strongest projects (the ones that are closest to real‑world work), and move your core technical skills (Python, ML, MLOps tools, cloud, etc.) near the top so a recruiter can see them in 5–10 seconds. The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?  Naive People like you think the world exist in black and white?|||Those who're saying his professional works matter only, then ig Sanduk Ruit's biography was removed!

I left that job - after 6 months or so, I happened to go to one of my co-worker's village. it was dirty, village was dirty okay, with nasty odour, we were there for a NGO and had to do work.  He offered me meal, there,- I declined citing that I don't want to have now, also  because the area was dirty and I am such a prick in such cases, I have problems.       A year later - I was in town nearby one of the villages in terai - and there were similar coworkers - I was stationed there so had to take meals in office / around office. I called coworkers - but they hesitated  and never came to eat together.    So - slowly there is change happening but. economic standards are changing and with that cleanliness and other things associated with money are also changing.    Kathmandu ma kam garne colleague - they were open to mingle/ eat with me but not terai ko sano town ma kam garne sathi.    And with increasing education and increasing wealth - confidence of so called \"untouchables \" will change.    for that- I feel only solution is to have strong economic policies to uplift.   With money, you get wider perspective.       ",

UML is back to its way of attacking Balen everyday & Balen hasn't said a word about them. I like the way pattern is repeating.|||Yes|||yo photo therathum ko hoina hola..|||History repeats itself haha, this guy will turn out into a new dictator.

Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

Manga dinxu vanya tara i think the date might be too soon, like way before i can afford that shit. Is there something affordable and special i can give him?

And if you also think suru dekhi gifts dinu hudaina matinxa and will get spoiled tara guess what i wanna spoil that guy crazy. It's just my life doesn't offer much rn.   Also date kasto hunxa?😭 Like, I don't eat out a lot. Like, it's rare for me. And he's quite a regular outside. Idk how to order and stuff. What if it's expensive😭 I don't want to do 50/50 and shit, i wanna pay the entire thing. And it seems like he's quite comfy with the 'man pays for the meal' shit tara noooioo. He's just a little baby like me! I don't want to burden him with that. Tyasaile i was kind of thinking of going on a date a few years paxi tara i think it'd be a bit sooner. I will have to do some free lance shii defo during my undergrad.   Hyaaannn kasto rant sesh bhaidiryaaa k. La, just tell me, what should i get him on dates? Flowers? i can maybe tara it has to be accompanied with something! Self made gifts are my forte tara wouldn't it be tiring for him? Ahhhhh. Ik you will say ki ask him, tara that sweetie of a male always says 'you'. Ik he's just being nice (and when i point this out he's like, i am not being nice) tara ahhhhhhh. Helllpppoppp!
