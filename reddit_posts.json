Mountain biking through villages, high trails, suspension bridges, ancient trade routes, with some of the biggest mountains on Earth looming in the background.  Why does this feel niche  instead of world-famous? Because that article could just as easily have been about: Trail running Ultra-marathons Spiritual retreats High-altitude training camps Wildlife + jungle + mountain combo trips Culture + adventure hybrids  Nepal has all of this. Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism. Anyone interested or has advice plz buzz me",

            "body": "Hi everyone,   Sharing this so others don’t get fooled like I did.  I’m a Nepali girl working a 9–6 job. A few days ago around 7 pm, I was heading home on my scooter near Lagankhel. A girl suddenly crossed in front of me, so I slowed down. Then she started calling me and talking in English.  She said she is from China and had taken the wrong bus and needed to go to Banepa. She said she was alone in Nepal, had no money, and urgently needed around Rs. 4000 and asked me for Rs.1000 and said she will ask remaining money to others just as me to take a taxi. She fully convinced me. She kept saying she was scared and didn’t know what to do.  She even promised, “I will return your money tomorrow morning at 10 AM.”  At that moment, I felt bad and trusted her, so I gave her Rs. 1000.  I offered to book her a ride through Pathao/InDrive, but she refused and said she had bad experiences and needed to walk inside the highway area (around 50 meters), which sounded unsafe. I even offered to drop her on my scooter since I was going towards Bhaktapur (closer to Banepa/Dhulikhel side), but she refused that too.  Right after I gave the money, she asked for more, which already felt suspicious, so I refused.  Then something even weirder happened — she immediately took out a small paper and pen and asked me to write my name and phone number. The paper was tiny, just enough space for only my name and number, like it was already prepared. That honestly made it feel very planned and scripted.  Now I’m a bit scared thinking what if she misuses my name or number.  Two days later, I told my office dai about it. He said the **exact same girl (or same story)** approached him in Bhaisepati with the same dialogue, and he also gave her around Rs. 500. That’s when I realized it’s probably a scam.  This is honestly scary because they target kind people by acting helpless and alone.  Just sharing this so others don’t fall for the same thing:  * Don’t give cash to strangers with emotional stories * Offer to book a ride or help them contact authorities instead * If they refuse all practical help and only ask for cash, it’s likely a scam  Has anyone else experienced something similar around Lalitpur/Kathmandu?  Stay safe everyone 🙏",

An MP’s real job is lawmaking. They are supposed to make good laws, fix bad policies, question ministers, and make everyday life easier through reforms. Development projects are planned and built by ministries, local governments, and the National Planning Commission. MPs can only request or pressure for budget allocation. They don’t actually build anything. Because of this confusion, MPs spend more time cutting ribbons than making laws. We then complain about weak governance and bad policies. Surprise. If we want real development, maybe we should start judging MPs by the laws they pass, not the roads they pose next to. What do you think?",

While everyone else is shouting, reacting, and overplaying their hand, he is doing what he does best: waiting. And history shows this works.  In Nepali politics, if you wait long enough, someone will mess up. A coalition will crack. An ego will explode. And suddenly, you are back in power without moving a finger.  Patience is his real superpower.  This is not weakness. This is veteran gameplay.  He is not trying to control the chaos. He is letting the system collapse just enough, as it always does, knowing that instability eventually calls for the most “acceptable” face in the room.  And that is exactly where he thrives.  Now here is where we come in. This election should be about proving this entire cycle irrelevant.  We must vote for a clear, strong government with a mandate big enough that patience politics no longer works.  This election is not about replacing one leader. It is about breaking a political strategy.  And with him, we must finish the Prachandas and the Olis. For Nepal.",

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

We were supposed to receive them by **Magh 1 samma**, but they still haven’t arrived.  We’ve tried calling and texting on WhatsApp (+977 976-7553020 — the number listed on his Instagram), as well as reaching out via Instagram, regular calls, TikTok, and Messenger, but there’s been no response. What’s worrying is that the phone seems unreachable — ek ghanti jaancha ani call gets dropped.  Not accusing him of anything, but this is starting to feel concerning (hopefully he’s okay). Based on his social media presence, he seems legit. Tara wedding ko date aaisakyo, so obviously we’re stressing out.  This is his Instagram for reference:   [https://www.instagram.com/swoyamm\\_gurung/](https://www.instagram.com/swoyamm_gurung/)  If anyone has dealt with him before or has any info on how to reach him, that would really help.

I love this tweet by Brian Norgard: “The smartest people in almost every field have a physics background.”  Aristotle, Newton, da Vinci, Richard Feynman, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Jim Simons, Geoffrey Hinton, the list goes on and on. If you actually check the background of smart people, most of them are good at logic, which comes from math and physics.  Physics teaches you what is true. It is simply the search for truth. For now, physics is the highest form of truth we have. It might be something else in the future, but that doesn’t matter. By studying physics, you’re basically studying how everything works.  Back to Jim Simons: “You can teach a physicist finance, but you cannot teach a finance person physics.”  After becoming good at physics, you can learn anything, because you’ve already tackled one of the hardest things.  Math teaches you how to think. If you want to learn physics, math becomes necessary, because without it you can’t learn physics. That’s where the importance of math comes in.  Other examples are engineering and computer science. These subjects revolve around the same ideas as well.  Basically, you build your foundation on science. These subjects teach you to think logically and critically, and most importantly, they force you to see the world from a different angle.  That’s it. You just learned the secret to become smart. You’re welcome.  Essay inspired by [Scott](https://share.google/ShBJhO7M70xdglnT4) Adam.

I wouldnt consider the port forwarding for now and if this works while i have my phone and laptop in the same network it would be just fine. This should work right? I haven't tried though.  P.S. I am talking about my main laptop and not laptop as a homelab. What I am trying to say is if i have a server and systemd setup it could be my portable media server as i go. I understand it could take cpu heavily but by media i am only thinking about photo and songs (not video, I understand video encoding load would be very heavy)",

Use **Immich** for photos (Google Photos replacement) and **Plex or Jellyfin** for music/video.  Everything works locally without port forwarding.  If you ever want remote access later, just add **Tailscale,** no router config needed.|||Yes. Homelab can be just your old laptop running server software. Servers are basically just computers with some kind of software running that exposes their functionality in a network with a port.  For example you want to run Immich  Just download and install as per the instruction , and leave it running 24/7. There you go , you have a working homelab server.  And as for accessing those services outside your home network, you don't need port forwarding these days. Just use services like Tailscale or Cloudflared tunnel. Though both have different usecases and specific need features.  But do keep this in mind that running Immich and Media server could take a little more than just an average CPU usage. If you have large photo library, immich needs to process thumbnails of each of them and do other stuffs like live transcoding, same goes for media servers like emby or plex.  If you want to use it as a media server, then I would recommend that you make your laptop act as a NAS, and use softwares like Kodi to do on device video decoding for the playback.|||I ran navidrome for just music on my home server that i use through wireguard vpn to connect to my home network. On phone you can just use a client for navidrome which are plenty and good as well.|||![gif](giphy|mRpYh11bLKZlm)|||It is indeed feasible to utilize a single laptop as a media server. This setup can also provide real-time synchronization. When considering its purpose, it is most effective as a home server, allowing you to keep it at home and free up storage on your portable devices, such as your phone. This way, you can access the server and have a backup of your phone's data whenever needed. However, carrying it around for mobile use would negate its primary benefit.",

            "comments": "A separate meter for home EV charging isn't really useful or cheaper. It's the same rate as your home connection. You just have a separate meter and risk tripping the main fuse less since it's not overloaded with EV charging + other home appliances, especially if you have a 16A MCB and charge during the day and use washing machine, oven, electric cooker/heater. You'll still be paying the same tariff but also two service charge for two meters so its still more money at the end of the month. Unless you consume a lot of energy because NEA has slabs for how many units you use and you are charged according to your usage slab. EV charging for commercial purposes, that's where it might be cheaper and have some subsidy.  https://preview.redd.it/djnj9aa3w1hg1.jpeg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a5a0f1c98c3800260ced5c337f00d1f45afa81e  You can get your local electrician to get the wiring done as long as they use proper thickness of the wire. 7kW means you need at least 32A of MCB and charging your EV will use up all that 32A of current if it actually pulls 7kW. In this case it might be better to have a separate meter and MCB. Maybe this is why they asked you to get a new meter so the fuse doesn't trip. Also if the charger power output configurable? In that case you can set it as 8/10/16A and will pull only 3.5 kW giving some headroom for the rest of the house.  Earthing can be shared, you don't need a separate earthing connection just for EV charging.|||Badaicha!!!  I don’t have EV car :P but before purchasing car(gas) i do research lot and watched lots of video about ev car charging. better use same 7kw because even if you ride daily 30 - 60km it will last for week.

            "body": "The literacy rate in Sarlahi-4 is just 54.7% (one of the lowest in Madhesh Province), while Kathmandu-4 has around 90%. Because of this, people in Sarlahi-4 might be easier to influence and have less access to social media or information.   In the 2079 election, RSP didn't put up a candidate in Kathmandu-4 and kind of gave passive support to Gagan Thapa. But now, they're fielding a strong candidate there, Pukar Bam. RSP's popularity is growing fast in big cities and even in villages, so Kathmandu-4 has become a very risky seat for NC.  On the other hand, Sarlahi-4 has traditionally been a strong Nepali Congress area. Amresh Singh won from there earlier on a Congress ticket, then left the party and won as an independent in the last election by a very small margin. With a big national leader and potential future PM like Gagan Thapa running from there, voters in the constituency might prefer someone with that kind of national profile and influence.  I believe these are the main reasons Gagan fled Kathmandu and went to Madhesh.   People of Ktm-4 elected him 3 consecutive times and he always comes up with some narrative about how he was held back and couldn't do anything within the party. People there might be fed up with him and would have probably chosen a fresh face over him.",

            "body": "I logged into Facebook after a long time, and my feed is almost entirely political. But what stood out was this sheer amount of content around Harka sampang. Clips, edits, those cringe “thug life” videos every few scrolls. What’s worse is the comment sections. He’s actually being supported, outright praised and worshipped.  Meanwhile, anything related to RSP, Balen, Sudan, or Rabi is flooded with negativity. The contrast is crazy. Harka is consistently praised, even though there’s a very obvious pattern in who’s doing the worshipping. But, this alone is very concerning.  I genuinely don’t understand how this makes sense. It sucks; to realize that these are the same people who get to vote. Is it really that hard to read a person? At this point, it feels like the average Nepali voter either cannot distinguish right from wrong or simply refuses to think.  I can’t tell whether people are being emotionally manipulated or if they’re choosing to stay ignorant. Harka Sampang shows clear traits that should worry anyone paying attention: visionless leadership, arrogance, a self-centered and narcissistic attitude, rejecting any idea that doesn’t align with his own, behaving as if he alone is always right. There’s a whole history of him hating certain caste groups and religions, clear hypocrisy, and a massive ego.  He used Balen’s popularity to win, then turned around and started attacking him constantly. He has used children to ask for votes. He selectively targets certain leaders, the current government, and anyone associated with Balen, while staying suspiciously silent about older parties. This isn’t accidental, right? He knows exactly what he’s doing.  And unfortunately, it seems to be clearly working on people who hate thinking. I feel so sad for them.",

Which generally provides Bachelor Hons program in BBA, BSc IT And BHM.  ​To be honest, I’m pretty nervous. I'm still in confusition regarding courses and Being a \"mature\" student after a long break is one thing, but there are a few other things on my mind:  ​The Cost: It’s costing about 8-10 lakh for the 3 years, which is a big investment.   ​The Pattern: The course follows a trimester system and assignments based. I’ve never studied this way before—is it hard to keep up?  ​Future Master’s: Since it’s an 3 years of Bachelor degree which equivalent to TU but, I’m worried about whether foreign universities will accept this degree if I want to do a Master’s later.  ​I have no experience with this type of international college setup.  ​Is anyone else in a similar \"affiliate\" program?  How are you finding the trimester workload, and do you feel the degree is worth the high cost?  ​I'd love to hear from anyone who started their degree after a gap!",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world. Eura seat kam hune vayo.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself. If u go some old tantric temple there are those flag . Prithivi was into tantra himself (people say he used it throughout the war) also remember that his and gorakhnath relationship.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

I’m educated, from an engineering background, not sheltered yet I feel oddly behind in literacy compared to male peers who seem to pick it up informally through family and social circles.

I took on the role where I’m helping on the day to day tasks and other things like finishing compliance related trainings but my brother was taught the ins and outs of the business that I was not.  In terms of personal finance, I was only taught to save and nothing more. So, I had to learn about the stock market, budgeting and planning for my financial future on my own. But I think in terms of personal finance, my brother and I got about the same knowledge from family.   While my experiences may differ, I want you to know that your experiences are valid. I feel compelled to share this because many people here are trying to gaslight you by insisting that such discriminations do not exist. These discriminations do exist, whether intentionally or not.|||I had similar experience when I was a little girl. My brother started driving in a very young age . He’s younger than me by one year. He was given all sort of financial responsibilities just like paying school fee , paying utilities bills etc .

I goggled a lot, asked questions, figured out . Now cut to today , my family prefers me over my brother for any suggestions as they think I’m good decision maker than him .

Why does this feel niche  instead of world-famous? Because that article could just as easily have been about: Trail running Ultra-marathons Spiritual retreats High-altitude training camps Wildlife + jungle + mountain combo trips Culture + adventure hybrids  Nepal has all of this. Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism.

            "body": "As someone who used to work at Tribhuvan University, I have closely seen and experienced what student unions stand for, so let me tell you something and share some events.  Most people in those student unions, except for very few, do not have any political ideology at all; all they are able to say is we need to develop the country, have better education, health, employment, infrastructure, and whatnot. So why are they putting so much time and effort into politics?  Simple answer: they get to experience some power and money.  Sometime ago, in our department, the student union of UML threatened the chief to sign documents for tender regarding the purchase of computer equipment. Everything was recorded in video by the chief and we can clearly hear the chief saying it hasn't gone through the process and he doesn't know the quality and details of the purchase, and the response from the student leader was \"Ahile sir yaha kurchi kurchi uthayera hannu naparos...maile vanesi mannu na...sign garnus...tapailai paxi kei man parena vani hami saman nai change garamla....kei farak pardaina...ahile sign garnus...garo banaunu vayo vani hamlai ni garo huna aauxa...tauko tauko ma chair le hannu naparos.\" The campus chief signed. The video became viral over social media in our campus groups, Tribhuvan University asked for clarification, and that is all - no other action taken. The reason for making him sign the document? So that they can purchase lower-quality equipment and put extra money in their pocket.  This other story is of few years back, a professor who worked in USA finally returned to Nepal and he wanted to make a lab at Trichandra campus. When he didn't agree to give commission to NSU (Congress student union) while purchasing spectrometers, they grabbed the old-aged professor from campus and beat him on the road with their legs. This happened less than 300 meters from KTM Police, Ratnapark. He had to be admitted in ICU. And of course, the students got away with no consequences. I think they later told that the cause for beating was increasing college fee.  They also do some good work like speaking for students and speaking against bad decisions of campus administration but doing the comparison, it just feels like they just do the good works to hide their actual intentions. If they get commissions regularly, they stay silent but when they don't get money, they start protesting. Most importantly, they are not hesitant to be violent as they know if they get arrested, it will be for a short period of time, and the police will release them after political pressure. I remember a few UML students even beat up police on dress while drunk a few months ago.  They also slowly transition to national politics and this is what they want to do later on. They want to show as if they are doing works but the only reason is to get commissions.  And this is true not only for these two student unions, it is also true for most of the political associations, including those of professors, students, and employees. Every group forms a political association, and in order for everyone on a committee to agree on something, they have to receive something, leaving not enough money for actual works. This is why we have low quality stuffs, and this is why things take so long to be done. This is why they are able to afford good lifestyle without job being student for decades. Remove the money and freedom to be 'gangster who doesn't get intervened by police' from equation and I wonder how many students will be left in those student unions",

If you believe Gangan’s “Naya party” Congress will move to ban these student unions. Congrats you failed. RSP doesn’t have any unions yet and Sumana tried to get these unions out last time as well.|||I also have closely seen students unions and their functioning over a sustained period of time and the thug activities that they perform are undeniable. The political culture and the intent of a lot of those members of student unions are there just for the power exercise as you say. They have been very bad and might continue to be bad. I have had worst possible experience from those unions personally too, so I am not vouching for these activities and completely agree the lawlessness they tend to follow.  But in principle I do think that they have some good purpose to serve, if done properly. I think there are two ways about it:   1. Because they are bad, let's ban them willy nilly.   2. They are bad, but they serve  good purpose in general, so lets think about possibly improving them.  The first one seems easy way out, lets work to ban them altogether. But how? Do we ban students getting together and discussing? What if they don't explicitly say they are party association, the association isn't something that you can prove. Beause unionization, we think,  is something a democracy should allow, does banning them amount to restricting democratic right? This could be a slippery slope and we might never be able to pin point a boundary for them to unionize and associate with some political party, because in principle we can't ban having political viewpoint.     The second seems a bit more ideal. We want to weight in the possible cons compared to the pros that they offer. And, I think if done well, the pros have something good to offer. So in principle I wouldn't ban unionization (students or otherwise). If we have strong criminal prosecution and strong adherence to laws of campus (in case of student unions), we can improve situation a lot. I think that thuggery is not unique to unions but is prevalent in more areas of society and we can't ban them all. Its just the reflection of society and some campus can control  them more some don't.      I have also seen some very good deeds done by the student unions personally, across different student unions. And at times, I have been impressed by what can be achieved by the unionization of student, if done with correct motive.      And lets get real, no one is going to ever ban any sort of unionization be it students or workers or else in a democracy. I have some people think RSP would ban them; they won't.|||Thank you and this presence of student unions in our public education system is a huge problem and if any party can decrease their influence then it is RSP which has no student unions. Gagan led NC won’t do it because he believes in such unions.|||Nepal's Top Uni TU, nothing to be proud of. Poorest at every level.    Few blocks of very old building here and there without any safety and hygiene.    Most of the Professors don't care, they take orders from their parties, they are very arrogant of their degree and don't give time to students.|||Instead of banning them, making them face their consequences would do greater good, is what I think. Imagine if the students who beat the professor were charged with assault. Now that would be the consequence. This would stop evil. We need unionisation for the good things. For the bad things, there should be consequences.|||This so called student union died the day they kept quite when Students were dying in the streets.|||Vanna lai chai sabaile ban student unions vanxan tara sabai naramro hudainan some people actually help students and don't ask for money from the college .

I am sure the excuse is gonna be well he was minority in the party and couldn’t do anything but, how can we be sure he will do anything big now that he is party chair??     **2. Part of the same highly politicised corrupt system:** Anyone who even has basic understanding of Nepali politics knows a huge part of lack of development in Nepal is that system has become super politicized with party unions in schools and hospitals, in civil service. You cannot get a good political appointment without having a party affiliation. Gagan Thapa himself came from Nepal students union. We need to try to break this system and how can I trust Gagan and his NC party even trying to change this?? Gagan Thapa alone can’t do everything and would his party members allow him to dismantle a system they have enjoyed for decades?? Like Gagan has said he wants to appoint people based on merit, but Can he do that when he has so many party members who will pressure him to give them appointment??  FYI.. RSP has no student or trade unions so far.     **3. Corruption investigations:** We know a lot of NC leaders have serious allegations of corruption. Even Gagan Thapa was forced to give ticket to Bijay Gacchadar who has been accused of corruption. So, Can we trust that he is gonna initiate corruption or other criminal investigations on various party members that may weaken his hold on the party??     These three reasons are enough for me not to vote for Gagan Thapa and his NC party this time around.",

Private Bills almost never pass in the parliament. You can bring bills but it will never pass unless ruling coalition and few other parties all collectively agree that it can be passed but with significant changes and compromise. Also there is party whip, you can disagree but never go against the party during parliamentary vote. You will get disciplined, ousted from the party and never get another chance.   That is fair criticism but did health insurance collapse under his leadership? I think consecutive government lack of funding and management also played a huge role. Personally I have benefited from the program. Also he did create legal, regulatory and financial structure for the program. It was a fragmented idea, but it did become concrete under his leadership and millions benefited from. Even if it collapsed but the framework is still there, it can be started again with some structural change and dont think the blame lies on Gagan on this one. There have been multiple other health ministers and multiple government after him whom each played a part in mismanagement.   Student politics is not necessarily bad. Also the history of student unions in Nepal is a bit different. Panchayat ma party nahuda, and lack of social media back then, the only way to organize politically was in universities and campuses. Also praya jasto sabai janta were illiterate back then, so politics was obviously only happening within educated circles, professors and students. The way gen z protest were organized in social media because people have access, navako vaye the only way would be to be form groups in school and colleges right? Natra kasari organize gartheu. Also before student politics sabai neta ko udpadan Indian university ma hunthyo, this did bring leadership opportunity inside Nepal. Also democratic society ma timile union ra group banaunai paudaina vannai mildaina. If me and few other RSP supporters want to make a club in my college for the upcoming election who can stop us? Also trade union ra bidhyathi sangathan navayera ta ho RSP le different ideology vako manche tara facebook follower ra celebrity status ko manche lai ticket badheko. They dont have an avenue of producing leaders who are ideologically aligned.   Also ticket badhne kura chai Nepali Congress ma dai ra vauju ko hat ma hunthyo.

Kei garnai nasakine. Yo pali pani ticket was already distributed before the leadership change happened. So I do understand that new leadership did not have much time to finalize the tickets and he has admitted so too that there have been mistakes but the good thing is they passed a new set of laws regarding tickets during the mahaadhivesan. Starting next election the person will go through like a primary where NC members from a election region will elect who gets the ticket, savapati le sign gardai badhne din chai hatakai ho but logistically yo pali navyako vanya I think thats fair.

Even the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, they were able to rebuild the fastest after the earthquake from their own funds. There are also many other good initiates in Bhaktapur. Bijukchhe also gave up his MP seat to someone else in the party so that's good too. They have a lot of youth representatives running for election too, I think it's just behind RSP and certainly a lot ahead of Nepali Congress, UML, etc.  As for downsides, they do restrict some things in Bhaktapur, such as INGOs do not have the same access they do in other places. Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party. With the work they've done in their area, they could have promoted them and tried for more seats in other areas but they don't seem to put any efforts towards that, leaving them with extremely limited seats.   We know their MPs have mostly speak out in the parliament with a good voice.

Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.|||Visited North Korea|||[Here's his interview with gorkhapatra](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010090943/http://gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=29063&cat_id=29)|||How is not letting ngo work a bad thing?

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section.

It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

I know, but AI could write 100-1000 of line of code at just in a minute, to be honest is the human who will have to review the code.  But the fact is, If the system is huge, there will be lot of moving point (logic), many time what to do how to solve this problem is not clear , there are lot of edge case the we have to think, test. As human we remember what we did yesterday, past month we can think and recall but AI is not aware of any think, unless we told explicitly tell is what to do. So, Ai is just a tool(powerful what, if you know when and how to use it).  So, don't think about the outcome just learn, focus on the foundation, learn the basic, try to do hard think your self, use ai to learn new concept not to code in the beginning, give yourself a chance to make mistakes and correct later. Choose any language (py/NodeJS/Goland) DSA, OOP, OS, DBMS, CN. Learn any framework, the path and way will itself be clear after you start moving forward. Hope this Help.|||Start from Js.

At my corporate setting, we generate code, that used to take 4 devs 6 months to write, in just a few days. Spending time coding solo in the flow like in the old days, now feels stupid, almost as ridiculous as someone coding in a text editor instead of IDE. That being said, the quality of code that LLM generate is direct result of how well you understand your problem. If you know how to breakdown the problem, the algorithm to use, applicable design pattern, test strategy, potential performance bottleneck, the quality of code that comes up is just amazing.  It's looking like newcomers need to directly think like an architect instead of code punchers.|||We are in a phase where some companies are planning to cut employees by utilizing AI, some have already done so and some even have started rehiring because Excessive use of AI created even more problems.

Within two to three years things will start to get clearer|||if AI is helping you that good. Why dont you dig in whats makes AI underneath so powerful.

Honestly, I'm sure your platform doesn't do it better in that regard. Who's going to use it? For what?  If you care about usability, just release the datasets (with doi or something). I'd just want the data APIs/ structured data. If I'm using it for training, I couldn't care less about the interface. Or better yet, preprocess, shuffle, and give the train-test-validation splits.

Good engineer can use AI in proper way, Vibe coders don't know how to things works or how to scale things... it's just a hype|||From what I have seen from a hiring perspective, you definitely won't get past the initial round if all you know is vibe coding. Writing code is just one of many things that engineers do. There is a lot of designing, planning, presenting possible options to higher management, beaurocracy, compliance and risk assessment involved in the process. And then comes the hard part -- debugging errors and bugs, and good luck with that if you're just sitting in the chair writing prompts. AI is good at finding solution with the historical training data, but sometimes you come across problems and situations that nobody else has gone through, or no resource / solution is available in the internet. Pilots use autopilot for the most of the time during the flight, but the whole purpose of having skilled pilots in the cockpit is for them to be able to detect anamolies if any, and be able to take over if need be. Relying on vibe coding without knowing the internals is like someone flying a plane relying on the autopilot without knowing much of how to fly a plane.     However, if your plan is not to be an engineer but to boostrap something and sell it, then that's a little different.|||brother, focus on the basics. don't believe the hype - vibe coding in production apps is disastrous. you NEED to understand every line of code that AI generates, find flaws, test and refactor and you can't do that unless you know how to write good code.|||There is nothing like Vibe coding. It's just a mind virus🙃. It will destroy the potential good engineer inside you if you start vibing.|||Vibe coding is good if you want to start your own startup and earn in the future. killer to start any thing.   But it’s bad if you’re applying for a job. companies will easily poooo over your CV, degree, or vibe-coding projects in your portfolio.  Just check r/HTML and r/CSS—why are they still so active? Outside of real work, people keep asking tiny, tiny questions that can be done in minutes using any modern grid builder or page builder. Yet they insist on learning everything from scratch.  I’m mentioning HTML/CSS because I’m a CSS developer.|||CFBR|||if what you are saying is true then what value will this information technology degree even have. (i am coping)|||From experience - Honestly, if you can write code properly without relying too much on “vibe coding,” do it. Once you start depending on it heavily, you might slowly forget real syntax and how to structure code yourself. I’m not saying you should never use vibe coding, just try to keep it minimal and use it in moderation.|||You have to ultimately become a good debugger than a coder. My suggestion for you is to explore systems / frameworks / patterns while you vibe code but learn DSA to the core, after all it is what gets you a job. a project to show and some programming skills to hide you vibe coded.       My say about the career as a whole, it is very uncertain that software engineering will last after 5 years. Companies are already looking for senior only roles, next it would be architect only roles, who knows.|||Watch lectures and take notes. When AI gives you code, make sure you understand it. Moreover, download the repo from GitHub and try to understand the complex architecture without the help of AI. If you can do this, then only you can switch to vibe coding...|||I think coding as a whole is taking in some massive changes, and I firmly believe that you should use coding tools for any programming job.|||Focus on software engineering rather than writing code, noone will value how well you remember the syntax of a particular language anymore, you should know it for sure. But don't get too involved in it.   Previously we used to see programming as a compiled interperated language, which still is true on a fundamental level. But now it's become more about building Lego building, you should be more focused on which block to add or remove and less about what is inside a block,   Example: you have to make calculator   Previously: know how to do c=a+b for sum. C=a*b for mul,  Now,  Create add, multiply, divide, subtract function, take user input, know the operation. Operands and operators  These are the building blocks.   Being said that. Knowing the fundamentals is as important, the use of actual CS background comes into play when you are designing the blocks to give less ambiguity to AI to hallucinate. See it as, you are a civil engineer doesn't mean you join each bricks ylby yourself. You instruct !|||Whatever you do, understand the code (in core level). And you should be confident enough to code without copying or looking in 80% case.|||Do vibe but first you must know basics, syntax and flow of your tech stack",

            "body": "I used to always wonder how some people are smart. I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you can become one.  I love this tweet by Brian Norgard: “The smartest people in almost every field have a physics background.”  Aristotle, Newton, da Vinci, Richard Feynman, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Jim Simons, Geoffrey Hinton, the list goes on and on. If you actually check the background of smart people, most of them are good at logic, which comes from math and physics.  Physics teaches you what is true. It is simply the search for truth. For now, physics is the highest form of truth we have. It might be something else in the future, but that doesn’t matter. By studying physics, you’re basically studying how everything works.  Back to Jim Simons: “You can teach a physicist finance, but you cannot teach a finance person physics.”  After becoming good at physics, you can learn anything, because you’ve already tackled one of the hardest things.  Math teaches you how to think. If you want to learn physics, math becomes necessary, because without it you can’t learn physics. That’s where the importance of math comes in.  Other examples are engineering and computer science. These subjects revolve around the same ideas as well.  Basically, you build your foundation on science. These subjects teach you to think logically and critically, and most importantly, they force you to see the world from a different angle.  That’s it. You just learned the secret to become smart. You’re welcome.  Essay inspired by [Scott](https://share.google/ShBJhO7M70xdglnT4) Adam.

Despite being independent, Balen was able to work with them and produce results.   Now Balen has whole RSP behind him and he can be even more effective.   Arko most important thing is no corruption allegations against Balen.|||https://preview.redd.it/dwlm7a9sv0gg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6235b0fc08dcc9d98fb462fc1373baa63f7c92b5  Dont say anything else this didi will cry that balen did nothing|||The works mentioned aren’t very much transformative and these works are done by most of the mayors across the country. Here’s point wise breakdown of things he has done that are more media boosted to show fairytale: 1. Scholarships: there was an existing rule that all private schools should give 10% scholarships to poor and talented students. I don’t deny some of schools tried to not meet 10% quota as the law but balen hasn’t done that all by himself. 2. Book free fridays are a good initiative from him and a new concept that students should focus on different aspects rather than only books. I like this decision of him. 3. Student lunch of rs25 is given from municipalities across nepal and it is mandated by local laws and noone can give less than 25 but they can increase based on spending capacity of the local government. So this is not the magical thing only he has done it is an automatic process by law. 4. Hospital beds: same story as scholarships, 10% beds should be subsidized according the law. He hasn’t done it but the existing laws have done, however the concern is some of the hospitals try to skip this csr. It is also implemented in most of the local governments across nepal. 5. He has done a good job to keep waste out of the city but as mentioned in this post “recycling “ as he had agenda to produce electricity upto 5MW from waste daily. Where is the electricity or a recycling plant? All the waste are dumped into banchare danda which effects severly to locals and their health. He fould have done better! 6. Tukucha and other rivers: there was a lot of hype arond these, but he just broke some infrastructure and left. No any restoration or pretective progress around those broken infrastructure. Such damaged infrastructure affects local residents in their daily life what about that? Could have done better! 7. He has built some falchas which look good! But the catch is the issue that came up with the amount of budget used to make falchas. There was a news that a falcha was made out of about 60 lakhs? He hasn’t clarified anything regarding this also. I agree heritage works are expensive but how was the tender process gone? As much i know mostly mahanagar handed out contracts directly without tender/bidding processes. It’s a grey zone for corruption and I can’t defend him in this context.  8. A very good work of him is retaining the encroached lands!! It was a vote bank for communists from a long time and noone could dare touching those sukumbasis and he dared. However he faced a lot of backlash but I appreciate his work in this matter. 9. He has managed parking and footpaths well! But the footpaths claim aren’t much visible on ground as claimed to be 250 places. It’s mostly around newroad and other areas still have narrow or no footpaths. It’s a media manufactured noise so he could have done better. 10. New busparks? Really? Where are the new busparks? Please enlighten me anyone. 11. Street lights: it’s not a huge number a mentioned in the post as ktm city is very big compared to these number and he could have done better! However he has installed some fire hydrants in inaccessible places which is very admirable. Also he had promised to install cctv across ktm while election campaigns, he could have done that at least  a pilot project in some places?  12. Digital: his live meetings is appreciable as transparency however it’s more of his favorable thing as he could have faced pressure inside a room full of oldies! Now he’s not facing any media or questions ?   Conclusion His delivery is below average than most municipalities in the country. However some of the efforts are genuinely impressive but most of the needed works can’t be done in his tenure. As ktm has budget of 25 arba+ yearly it couldn’t invest/spend a bare minimum of 25% each year! It’s far beyond national spending which is around 38%. He could have done better! For the present context he should face media do debates and present his idea of development and plans for it to the public. Everyone should be accountable and noone is”GOD”  This was a critical analysis of balen shah’s mayoral tenure.|||This too when the whole system was against him  Top dheki bottom kasaile kaam garna didaina thiye|||Actually hamlai physical development vanda pani suru ma policy level ma changes ra existing rules ko implementation chaiyeko cha!|||102 ko ambulance was a great help .

Him reclaiming public property and the waste management is way better. But he still underdelivered on a lot of his campaign promises. Kathmandu still remains one of the most polluted city in the world and he did nothing to help improve that. He promised improvements to the public transport, but didn't do anything. There are dozens of other promises like more accessible public toilets, improving drainage system, roads, environments, etc all of which he fell short on. I understand that not all of the campaign promises can always be achieved. But the problem is that he has such a cult of personality that people act like he's beyond questioning. And that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope that he wins, we're long overdue on big leadership changes. These old corrupt politicians have to be weeded out and Balen feels like a best opportunity to do that. But when he wins, I hope people start holding him accountable to his duties and his words. Otherwise, we'll just be repeating the same cycle.|||Let's not still try to hype him more than he deserves. This man has done things that no one dared to do but everything that he did was very ground-level stuff that the public can easily see and praise him for. It is understandable to try and make changes while you have the authority so I do give him the benefit of the doubt. If he does win this election and does things that can really paint a picture for a better future for Nepal then I'll be convinced that we have finally found a leader. Until then I would like to be skeptical. I do not want to give myself up to the idea of him being the perfect leader for our country, I do not want to grow up with this fantastical image of him in my mind and turn into a blind follower like much of the oldies. I admire him and his attempts but nothing that has actually won me over. Still better than anyone else though.|||What is did is not the question. The question is how many promises he implemented. The work listed here are some done by central government. He did the work for creating contradiction. I have not seen anything that is sustainable. Of being a mayor of the biggest metropolitan city people have expected much more.|||Balen is one of those rare leaders who didn’t come from the usual political pipeline and that’s exactly why people trust him. He speaks straight, works on the ground, and isn’t afraid to upset powerful interests if it means doing the right thing. Whether it’s cleaning up Kathmandu, enforcing rules equally, or calling out corruption, he leads with action more than words. You may agree or disagree with some decisions, but you can’t deny his courage, independence, and intent to change the system rather than benefit from it…he may not be perfect, but he is the best among the current political leaders.|||Tyo education ko each and every point already existing chij ho sarkar le nai dinxa Lunch money ta..

He portrays Sobita as a threat to Renu and clearly suggests that Renu should win. He even says that Sobita’s husband would not vote for her. He also claims that Sobita is creating a narrative that she is the *b*uhari of Chitwan.  Is this just a narrative? No. it is a fact. However, he does not mention Sobita’s strong background in law, even though the primary role of a Member of Parliament is to make laws.  Look at his thumbnail: “Jeet” is written under Renu, and “Haar” is written under Sobita. This is not just a coincidence.

I stayed until they came outside, I was shocked they were plus 2 or 10 class students in college/school dress. I mean doing such thing, in somewhat public space with no fear.  I mean wtf. Is this normal today? Doing that at a young age and in a unsafe place like that? I even coughed and knocked the table to let them know that someone was noticing, but no they kept going.  They looked like Madhesi, I am not being racist here but anyone else would be too scared to do that shit in public. I mean go find a room if you are that desperate or go to some cave idk .  Edit: Watching possible minors engage in that behavior in a public space shouldn't be traumatizing? No wonder there’s something deeply wrong with today’s society.     Edit 2: I didn't realize while writing this, \"Trauma\" maybe is a very heavy word. I was deeply shocked, but I recognize that using the word “traumatized” can diminish the weight of real trauma, which isn’t what I intend. Cheers and lmao",

Honestly, just use your money, shut everything down, go to Switzerland or somewhere, and relax.  And yes, it is sad that her house and childhood home were damaged by the protestors.

            "body": "Lets not forget how shitty Nepali Congress can be when it comes to protecting their gunda student netas. Remember Prem Chalaune, the sociology prof at Tribhuvan University?  Back in Oct 2020, NSU thugs (that's NC's student wing) locked up his department over some political bullshit protest. When he tried to unlock the tala to get classes going, they jumped him with iron rods and sticks, beat him so bad he had a fractured leg, head wounds, and was left bleeding on the street. He said in interviews they only stopped when other people on the street showed up, otherwise, he'd be dead for sure.  And our so called Yuwa Neta **Gagan Thapa?** Dude was silent as a mouse until everyone started tagging him on Twitter and pressuring him hard. Only then he spoke a lil about it, tyo ni last moment ma, but come on, his own party's goons did this!   Now his IT cell is out here whitewashing NC's image, hiding crime like this to make them look clean for votes. But hey, Gagan fans, why cant you critisize your party where its wrong? Just yesterday, thier KTM 4 candiate Sachin was comparing Gagan to Ram lol, like he's some silent god, but wait, \"Ram\" was dead silent and didnt utter a word when his own predecessors from student union beat a teacher almost to death. Hypocrisy much?  This is the kinda impunity NC breeds, government even tried to drop the case in 2023, **forcing Chalaune to hunger strike for justice.** Yes, Hunger strike ma basnu pareko thyo, can you imagine?   Court finally convicted the 6 goons in 2023 (upheld 2025), but two fled abroad with fake docs. Yes fake docs. In December 2024, Professor Prem Chalaune wrote formal letters to the **US Ambassador** (Dean R. Thompson) and the **Australian Ambassador** (Leann Johnston). Chalaune specifically alleged in these letters that they used fraudulent documents to flee while their cases were still sub judice (under consideration by the court).  If NC wins again, expect more of this thug politics ruining our unis and lives. Vote smart, dont let them fool you.",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world. Eura seat kam hune vayo.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me. The mayor of Pokhara, in my view, represents everything that’s wrong with corruption in Nepal.

Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here.

Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning.

Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity.

So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world. Eura seat kam hune vayo. KP oli haryo bhane uml will affected way more.   Another thing is you may be surrounded by uml loyalists, and don't know about other surroundings. Remember it was always going to be a close race. Balen needs to flip about 20-25K new votes, which he is capable of doing.|||Nepali people low key loves turmoil and drama.

I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र).

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.

The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s.

The artwork vividly deplicts the sacred Tuladaan ritual, in which the prince was ceremonially weighed against gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, all of which were then offered to Goddess Taleju Bhavani, the royal deity of the Malla kings.  The painting is currently housed at the \"Collège de France\" in Paris. Despite being a pricrless masterpiece, it has never been publicly displayed and remains far from its rightful home, Nepal.

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||This is projection.  He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.

And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is.

Indian here. Please kick them out of your country/ get them arrested. Many of my fellow countrymen still lack basic civic sense. These kind of people keep appearing because there are no consequences to their actions. Once nepali police start arresting them, copy cats wouldn't dare to do it again.|||Where is the freaking minister of foreign affairs. This has been going on for long time. Someone need to reach out to that prick and make him do his job in this matter. Bala something Sharma, you need to take action immediately asap. We don’t want to make nepal an India. Other foreigner might assume that those Indian are Nepalese too and our reputation as nepali is in critical situation.|||Contact local government.|||Any indian sub that we can cross post???|||Indian tourists ko kaam vanekai Nepal ma sasto ma ramailo garna painxa vanera aune ho . They come in their own vehicles , drive very rough, litter everywhere, harass women and fight with hotel owners over everything. Nepal does not have any benefits by bringing these clowns to our country.. either the government needs to charge Indian vehicles a hefty fee and punish wrongdoers or people will stop allowing them .  One of my friends has a resort in a popular tourist destination of Nepal, near the Indian border and we mostly get large number of tourists during the weekends and holidays . His father always asks us to come over and help them manage the resort in case any group starts misbehaving.. it's a regular occurrence there , so much so that we and the hotel owners have a group to alert others for help in case some group gets too rowdy and have had to throw groups of young guys past 1/2 in the morning for misbehaving with other guests and causing trouble for the hotel owners .|||I won't blame all Indian people but it's certain that there will be bad Indians in sufficiently large group. They are always bad influence no matter whether they are in Nepal or USA or Australia or Japan.|||Please share video links if any.|||My personal opinion - I think it's all because of mayor of Pokhara who is busy running away from the city because of his controversies.

So if we have strict regulations in place and authorities making sure everyone follows the regulation no matter tourist or local people, fining those who disobey then we should be fine.|||Where’s the link to the videos? Need it to raise awareness!|||Hi, keeping every city clean makes for a great experience for locals as well as travelers alike!  **Clear Rules + Visible Signage**  * Install **multilingual signs** (Nepali, English, Hindi) stating: *“No cooking / No littering / Fine applicable”* * Use **simple icons** so rules are understood instantly.  **Designated Picnic & Cooking Zones**  * Create **specific picnic areas** with:    * cooking shelters    * waste bins    * water access * Clearly mark **where cooking is allowed vs prohibited**.  **More Waste Infrastructure**  * Add **frequent trash bins** and **segregated waste points** in popular parks. * Regular cleaning schedules during peak tourist seasons.  **Tourist Awareness at Entry Points**  * Share **short etiquette guidelines** at:    * hotels    * bus parks    * tourist police booths * A simple **“Please help keep it clean”** flyer goes a long way.  **Active Presence**  * Deploy **park wardens or volunteers** who politely remind visitors of rules before problems escalate. * Friendly intervention to remind works best.|||I am a pokhara basi, there is indeed issue with littering and waste from not just tourist but also natives. Fohor faleko dekhda sab le criticise garnai parxa. Tara i dont know why nowadays this feels like a harrasment campaign online.  I have seen random young guys arguing with indian tourist. The reason \"cause indians throw trash\". Best part the guy wasnt even pokhreli and the tourist werent indian but from madesh. The reason of argument being 'assumption'.   I am tired of all the negativity online. Aware garaunu parxa ko meaning thaxaina kati lai. Instead of awareness many baisa chadeka are doing harrasment instead.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

            "body": "I used to watch In-Depth Story, but I’ve realized the content is fundamentally superficial. Here is why I believe the channel fails its audience:  1. The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

But my experience tells me having multiple clients is safe and secure for the long run. The more financially secure thing you can do is make a sensible investment inside Nepal.

Also if work load from abroad dries up, so does your dollar flow so better keep your spending habits checked and make a better investment now so that you are financially secure even without the jobs that will pay you in dollars.|||Should I improve english first or just applying for a remote job and then improving it while working?

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?

First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Then comes the mandatory grind:   DSA, LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, System Design, OOPs, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks.      Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.      And now the new wave:   AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Vector Databases.      After all this…   You might get a job.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

I don't know where I'll end up.|||I'm not sure why people are surprised. An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal.

You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs.

Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity.

And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

Now the male voice announces the initial location first e.g \"अहिले बाफल\" followed by the female voice, which sounds odd. I liked the way the female voice said those location names.   Please if anyone here works there. Change it to female announcement for the location name then male for the follow up.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

They really do under estimate Balen at every step. During KTM mayoral run, UML were advertising for Balen, thinking they're pulling him down by going personal at every event. Balen always kept quiet & kept going, ended winning the election convincingly. Then Oli came around in power and absolutely chokeslammed Balen as mayor because Oli was heading central government.  I feel like the tenure under Oli was why Balen is hell bent on uprooting Oli from his root itself & I'm so so so here for it. UML is back to its way of attacking Balen everyday & Balen hasn't said a word about them.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I’m so sorry your family is going through this. Liam is lucky to have people fighting this hard for him. 💛    Huge respect for how transparent you’re being with records + receipts! That matters a lot when people want to help. And yes, thank you Elevidys (and the teams behind it) for giving families a real shot at hope.    Boosting this: if you can’t donate, please share. Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

I am asking from my own personal experience as well as the fact that the pass rate throughout the college is only like 30-40%, or even lower.  In my class of 50, 11 (comp), only around 10-12 guys have passed. I personally passed and that too with hanging marks like 40, same with others. Drop down your opinions.",
