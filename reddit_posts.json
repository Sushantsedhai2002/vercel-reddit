Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

That itself was a bidroha against the entrenched cult politics that the Deuba gang has practiced throughout its history. Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||\\+ Former MP from Congress Binod Chaudhary ko CG Empire's money laundering and land scandals.|||What a poor attempt to paint somebody in bad light? Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).  NB: The \"jhole\" \"it cell\" commentors; bring it on!|||u/onlyfactos|||Congress will be a good opponent in the parliament.   Also, what's up with Rakshya Bam joining Congress?|||I heard he was doing a townhall live with the people, maybe you can ask him there?|||Good questions and he should answer them|||he is an opportunist.|||All these questions just miss the gravity of what Gagan has done. Clearly power structure within congress “was” too centralized, and being able to dismantle chokehold of elderly folks on Congress power alone wins my kudos. Regarding the issues you mentioned, great if he can denounce them but at least if it is not repeated again I will see it as progress.|||He might be worst than Deuba. At least Deuba doesn’t speak himself, but he is worst in all scenarios. He will mask everything with his words and media management.|||go email him and ask him directly. it is fair to question the person involved instead of turning everything into noise. tiktokey neta haru le barbad garne nai vayo at this point. all i can say is gagan is a well versed politician, still young, and someone who could probably handle being prime minister twice pretty flawlessly. not some fantasized rapper turned politician, wildly inconsistent, barely diplomatic when on ganja, and clearly not serious half the time. another one is purely opportunistic kavi lamichhane, the way he jumped into a ghatiya party just to grab griha mantralaya and settle scores with kantipurey says everything. no clear vision. he was genuinely good as a reporter but that does not translate to governance. in nepal,, politics honestly looks like the better career now, everyone villainizes wealth blindly while actors and influencers walk straight into parliament. for god’s sake, what are kaji or hakukaley planning next, film shooting inside parliament? it blows my mind.   I just rant here btw, anyway every person comes with flaws, you choose who you stand with and argue for them, i do the same. congress supporter till death. have a good rest of the day.|||Geda khau geda",

About the bachelors program it was covid time and most of the studies were completed online. They just provided 10% discount for us even though we weren’t using any assests from the clg.  The TU equivalency provided was just 3 years despite the college promising 4 years. The batch before us had gotten 4 years. While talking to the admins of the clg they said TU asked for money which they couldn’t provide hence the 3 years equivalence convincing us later they would fix it.  I am not from BHM so I can’t speak about anything that’s going on with the girl and the guy in media. I heard they were asking for bribes from the clg.  The Masters program was such a waste of time and money. They had only one class per day for 4 hours straight. Teachers even hesitated to give breaks. The classes were 2-3 per week depends on the teacher kaile kai ta clg pugi sakesi they would inform that aja ta sir aunnu hunna re vanera lol. Paid for 1 and a half years btw and the sem break was for 6 months straight lmao. 6 months ko paisa jhyap. Now I am worried about the equivalency that TU will provide.

Some say it's Gagan, some Rabi, some Balen, some Harka etc.  We need to understand that we live in a democracy and democracy should run on policy discussions not individual whims. We should have policies and agreements that would establish a common goal as a nation and work towards it. Leadership change should not mean we start all over again. We should all, well majority, agree on common values and discuss as to how to create policies and law and enforce these to achieve it.   Where and how can we have these discussions? Any ideas?",

            "comments": "Yes absolutely, public political discussions here often devolve into personal attacks rather than meaningful debate. Conversations focus on labeling individuals instead of examining what policies these leaders or their parties propose and how those policies might actually affect our lives. Rarely do we see discussions about what kind of economic, social, or governance reforms we want as citizens. Instead, we place our hopes on individuals as if one person alone can deliver a perfect Nepal. This mindset overlooks the reality that we live in a democracy, which should function through policies, institutions, and collective agreement, not individual charisma or personal morality alone. A healthy democracy requires sustained policy discussions, where leadership change does not mean starting from zero each time. As a society, we should aim to agree at least a majority level on common values and national goals, and then debate how laws, policies, and enforcement mechanisms can be designed to achieve them. The real question is where and how we can create spaces for such policy focused, constructive discussions that move beyond personalities and toward long-term national direction.|||Reddit was not like this.

Today, that highway is blocked by 20ft ditches and high-voltage fences built at the border.  **The result? A 'Lock-In' Crisis.** When elephants cross into Nepal for the harvest, they find their way back blocked. They aren't 'visiting' anymore; they are trapped. And a trapped, hungry elephant is a desperate one.  **The numbers are terrifying:**  * **Casualty Spike:** Human-elephant conflict has nearly **doubled** in the last two years. In Koshi Province, 10 people were killed just in the last year. * **The Total Toll:** In Jhapa alone, 72 people have lost their lives to this conflict. * **Retaliation:** In the last few months, **4 elephants were found dead**, electrocuted, or killed in the chaos.  This isn't just about 'conservation', it’s about a failed border policy that treats wildlife like an invading army. By digging trenches, India hasn't solved the problem; they’ve just pushed it onto the doorsteps of Nepali farmers.  We don't need deeper ditches. We need **Transboundary Corridors** that allow these animals to finish their journey. Stop the blockade. Stop the killings.",

Can you guys suggest whether I should start my own gym or study abroad and get a degree, work a 9-to-5 job, or start a small, nice, profitable gym business in a good market?

Do a lot of research for the area as it will make or break your business. I would say residential area is a good place to start a gym. But make sure you do your proper due diligence.|||gym kholeu vane ma tmro gym join garne vaye hai la|||My suggestion is to study abroad further while doing your PT. A degree 📜 is something that will always stay with you.|||that is something you need to decide for yourself.    but we sure can provide some perspectives.  as per me , i am in abroad    got pretty much free time to focus for networking , securing a job and study. still the job market is kind of hard and you may need to eventually join grad school after your studies. so add those years if you are planning for that and even after that its a no-guarantee that you will get a job here. You may earn some good money to come back to nepal and start your business/gym but i dont think that will happen once you go abroad , most likely you will get stuck there.|||Depends on a lot of things. Eg.  1. Which university and for what course can you get into abroad? Unless it’s super competitive it’s very hard to find a sponsored role after graduation.   2. How much profit is the average gym in the area you want to open in making AND how will you be able to compete.|||The answer is within yourself. Ask yourself what's the best route at this stage in your life. Collecting degrees solely isn't gonna help you in my opinion. But you're trainer experience is something invaluable for you. If opening a gym feels too big in your heart, ask yourself, what could be a smaller option but a step up from current situation? Think creative - remember it's a digital world right now but people crave in person interactions.    If you really want to study MBA or something, go for it. But the answer is in your heart, not Reddit. Maybe certification courses, or few weeks of training on business? Think about what you want and that'll guide your direction.    All the best!|||Baira jau!",

            "body": "Learn to build. Learn to code, and learn to sell. Make side projects as a hobby, and iterate again and again until something clicks. If you notice, the greatest builders and inventors didn’t start because they wanted to get rich. They started because they faced a problem or were curious. First comes creation, then you can sell your projects. That gives you a little more freedom in life, and then you can move on to the next thing.  If coding isn’t your thing, get into content creation. Make videos, start a podcast, or write blogs. Build an audience, and you have leverage. You can then sell products, ideas, or services to people who trust you. You don’t need millions of followers, *just aim for a thousand people who genuinely love your craft.*  Naval Ravikant says: *“The single most important decision you make is where you live. It drives your business opportunities, relationships, food and water supply, politics, activities, and day-to-day quality of life.”* I believe it’s the single most important success indicator in life. Your beliefs, your ideas, and the way you see the world are shaped by your environment. You can change your city by moving for school, a job, or to actually build something.  Who you surround yourself with matters too. Sam Altman, before OpenAI, founded Loopt and applied to Y Combinator. Through that, he met people like Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, and eventually connected with Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. All of them became mentors for him. Steve Jobs had Wozniak, Mark Zuckerberg had Peter Thiel, Bill Gates had Paul Allen. And if you’re wondering how to attract like-minded ambitious people, the answer is simple: **do something interesting**. As Sam Altman says: “The best way to get people to help you is to first help them. The second-best way is to be working on something interesting.”  Try lots of things. Expose yourself. Experiment. You never know which thing will make sense at what moment. Remember, **you only need to be right once**. The more risks you take, the luckier you get.  Read, especially biographies. Learn how the greatest minds thought, Benjamin Franklin, Newton, Einstein, Edison, Steve Jobs, Charlie Munger, Elon Musk. **Collect mental models**. Connect the dots. Sci-fi books will help you think beyond the imaginable. Math and physics teach you how to think critically and logically. Consume as much information as you can.  Every great scientist, inventor, or entrepreneur didn’t aim to be the greatest. They did what they loved because they were curious and passionate.  **That’s how you build the future.**  Read this essay on Medium: [https://marcuspandey.medium.com/how-to-build-the-future-a7d5fe99d799](https://marcuspandey.medium.com/how-to-build-the-future-a7d5fe99d799)  (Note: If you think I’ve missed something, please feel free to add it. If I find it interesting, I’ll definitely include it in the original essay. Also, please support my writing by reading it on Medium. Any suggestions or advice would be really appreciated.

            "body": "This one thing that helped me a lot to understand more about react.      Have you ever wonder why react can be used for building multiple applications? terminal app(ink), pdf(react pdf), mobile app(react-native).   It feels so magical to use react but the deeper engineering is really interesting, reconciliation, fiber architecture, schedulers, cooperative multitasking etc.      let's first build a mental model of UI, UI's are just a tree, aren't they all a tree like structure? you have a div inside a div, a button inside a div whole thing is wrapped with a body.      so if you were to change any part of that tree how would you change? maybe you would say, \"sanku, i will use write a simple js code, createElement, appendChild, innerHTML etc\") yes that simple js code with these functions get's a lot more messier and harder to manage, state gets messy but what if      i give you simple a library that will handle managing that tree for you? you don't have to worry about how to create, when to update etc will handle that for you, you just call functions(components are just a functions) even when you use a react component inside another component, you are just calling a function inside a function.      Now let's talk about React Elements, in that UI tree small building blocks are dom nodes same as in react the small building blocks are react element      {   type: \"button\",   props: { className: \"blue\", children: \\[\\] }   }      React Element's are immutable, you never change it later, they just say how I want my UI to look right now, If elements were mutable, React couldn’t reason about differences between two UI states.      const oldEl = { type: \"div\", props: { id: \"box\" } }   const newEl = { type: \"div\", props: { id: \"box2\" } }      now react does the diffing(Reconciliation). it's like \"hm type looks same(they are same html element), prop is updated, now let's go change the host instance\" so this make sure if two react element look similar we don't have to update everything      I will compare the updated and the previous \"UI tree\" and make changes into actual host nodes. React core knows nothing about those DOM nodes they only know how to manage trees that's why renderer exists. A renderer translates React’s intentions into host operations      hm but okay sanku what exactly is a Host Node/instance?      Now host nodes can be anything, maybe a DOM nodes for website, maybe mobile native UI components, or maybe PDF primitives?      React is just a runtime which can be used to build other thing as well not just \"websites\"",

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.

            "body": "Consent is not a blanket permission. It’s specific, situation-based, and ongoing. If this still sounds abstract, here are everyday and sexual scenarios that make it very clear.  Everyday, non-sexual scenarios (so it’s easier to understand):  • You invite a friend into your house to sit in the living room.  That does NOT mean they can enter your bedroom.  • You lend someone your phone to make a call.  That does NOT mean they can scroll through your gallery.  • You agree to help someone with homework.  That does NOT mean you agreed to do the entire assignment for them.  • You say yes to tea.  That does NOT mean yes to alcohol.  Nobody argues these examples. Everyone understands limits here.  Now apply the SAME LOGIC to sexual situations:  • You agree to making out.  That does NOT mean you agreed to intercourse.  • You agree to oral sex.  That does NOT mean penetration is allowed.  • You say “I’m not ready for sex” beforehand.  That boundary still applies later unless you clearly say otherwise.  • You say “no sex” and the other person says “okay” and does it anyway.  That’s not miscommunication. That’s a violation.  • You freeze, go quiet, or don’t push them away.  That is NOT consent. Freezing is a common fear response.  • Your body reacts (wetness, erection, moaning).  That is a physical reflex, not permission.  A very realistic scenario:  Person A: “I’m okay with kissing and touching, but no sex.”  Person B: “Okay, I won’t.”  Later, Person B penetrates anyway because “things got heated.”  That is not an honest mistake.  That is knowingly crossing a stated boundary.  If someone knows the difference between touching and penetration (they do), then they know exactly what they’re doing.  “But stopping is hard when you’re aroused”  Being aroused doesn’t remove responsibility. Adults are expected to control themselves.  If arousal justified crossing boundaries, consent would be meaningless.  Nepalese law:  Under Nepal’s Muluki Criminal Code, sexual intercourse without free and voluntary consent is sexual assault or more specifically rap..e .  Consent is invalid if:  • It was never given  • It was withdrawn  • It was ignored after refusal  • The person froze or was unable to resist  • It was obtained through pressure or deception  The law does NOT say:  • “Consent is automatic once sexual activity starts”  • “Silence means yes”  • “Changing your mind doesn’t count”  If someone says “you can do X but not Y”, that is not confusing.  That is a boundary.  Ignoring it is a choice, not an accident.  Consent is simple.  People only call it “complicated” when they don’t want accountability.  Ps:I just copy pasted it from a presentation gave a while back.",

You don't need to show yourself as cool, mature and open minded.   Intimate talks and intimate connections means boundary crossing without labels. You're not obligated to have a talk.

            "body": "Never thought I’d post this, but here’s my story about anxiety and men’s sexual health.  About a year and a half ago, I went through some personal trauma and made a few decisions I now deeply regret. Nothing illegal or extreme – just choices that didn’t align with who I really am.  After that, anxiety slowly took over. I became obsessed with the idea that I had ruined my health. My sexual drive dropped, I lost interest in intimacy, and eventually even my morning wood disappeared. That scared me more than anything.  I went to multiple doctors, did several rounds of tests, and everything always came back normal. But my mind refused to accept it. I kept thinking something was wrong with me.  I turned to Reddit hoping for reassurance, but honestly it made things worse. Too many panic posts and extreme opinions fed my fears instead of helping.  The truth I learned the hard way: anxiety can completely mess with sexual function. Lack of libido, weak erections, low ejaculation volume, strange sensations – all of it can be caused by stress and overthinking.  Only when I stopped obsessing, avoided porn, stayed busy, and worked on calming my mind did things slowly start improving.  Men’s mental and sexual health isn’t talked about enough. I felt alone for so long, but I now realize many guys go through the same thing.  If you’re dealing with something similar – get checked once for peace of mind, then focus on healing your anxiety. Most of the time, that’s the real problem.  P.S: Used GPT to shorten it, mine was way longer but you guys won't read it ik.",

Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

It was essentially 60 rs for the whole month, but it was often enough to kill time.|||Ohh. Massive nostalgia.   My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place. But please don't give up, gather your courage and try leaving this toxic relationship.  Maya ko naam ma aafno life barbaad nagarnus please. YO situation bata jasari bhaye ni niskinu try garnus. Legally  bhaye wa personally huncha, help magnus. Aafnai income cha bhane, you've got nothing to be scared of.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

I know a lot of you here are RSP supporters, so I am only asking you to please not be one dimensional. Analyze multiple variables and evaluate the scenario. Ask questions, if you support 99 things and question one aspect then you still are their supporter. Don't be pressured to defend everything.  Some sample questions:   1. Why did Rabi dai get another letter from attorney general\\[1\\] to kill the case and not go through the court process. What if mutton kaji also gets the similar letter from attorney general to silence his बाख्रा काण्ड, or बा? And for that matter anyone else make such letter. Rabi dai has already gotten it in two cases, one yesterday\\[1\\] and another for his dual passport case.  2. One prominent leader of RSP yesterday  in an interview said, \"The public has NO RIGHT to  not give RSP at least 138 seats in the parliament\"?\\[2\\]. Do you find that wording may be questionable, are you sure the other prominent ones in RSP don't feel the same? Is that mindset correct and logical?  3. Constantly attacking the ones who leave, Sumana (opportunist), Santhos Pariyar (opportunist), Mukul Dhakal (Opportunist), Kulman (opportunist) etc. All of them have expressed that RSP is run like a private company. Do you not have to regard political party fully transparent and trustworthy because they are PUBLIC instutions? Do you think may be they have merit in their conclusion, that the leadership model might be individualistic?  4. Most importantly, do we require policies, vision clarity and concrete plans to change the country for good? Is \"replacing the old guards\" enough for the kind of improvement we want? Do we not require intelligence, capability, knowledge, etc to take a whole COUNTRY forward? Social media likes and comments surely are not enough right?  and more questions.  I know I will get a lot of abuse from the majority of you, but that is ok(bring your best abuses, be creative, jhole is kind of lame). I will also ask a very tiny fraction of you, who actually question, to please not be totally demoralized. If we make enough requests and endure enough abuse, we might be able to convert one person to question on this.  \\[1\\]: [https://www.setopati.com/politics/379612](https://www.setopati.com/politics/379612)   \\[2\\]: [https://youtu.be/Hf2Oto0HZJs?t=4429](https://youtu.be/Hf2Oto0HZJs?t=4429)",

            "comments": "RSP feels like a cult now, not a party. There is no critical thinking among its supporters. They treat RSP as an institution that targets anyone who speaks against it—whether it’s comments on Sumana’s post or the recent hate against Kulman. The leaders of RSP feel entitled, and I don’t see a good way out now.|||Not all all RSP supporters are jholeys.  And if you have not already asked this question to Congress/UML, then you are missing out on context.   The root-cause behind all of this cult-support of political parties imo is the social-engineering by congress/yemale.  Political sister orgs (cpngress/uml) everywhere, party-allocations in all gov appointments, benefit of political connection, and thier entire families faith-based political suppurt-- Congress/UML are the biggest cult-based and coercion-based party in our society.  Imagine what it takes to get out of that?  Ultra strong resolve, frustration... thats what makes them such ardent independent or alternate party supporters.  Thats why, one of the key voting voting agenda for me is which party takes stand against party-fication of our society. At least, RSP stands for that.|||Yei ho .. arulai jholey vanda vandai afu uniharu vanda arajak vako dekhdainan kasaile. Question garyo vane manpari Gali khainxa . Garo xa naya lai kei vannu hudaina|||1. First of all, Rabi's sahakari case is still going and what is now being withdrawn is Organised crime and money laundering case which many legal experts and ordinary people said was designed to keep Rabi Lamichhane out of active politics for years. If those cases hadn't been withdrawn then Rabi would have been automatically suspended even if he had won the coming election and it could have taken years to resolve the case. So what Rabi did was send a letter to Attorney general office to revisit the case and they did and found out several problems with that case and it was recommended to withdraw them. Many of us believe that both these cases were filed against Rabi due to political pressure exerted on the local attorney office and now the political pressure has been lifted. Also, very important to remember that almost no politician who has had sahakari case filed against them, also had both organised crime and money laundering case against them.    2. That's just one RSP leader talking, it can't be the opinion of one party and people are free to vote for whomever they want but if they want real change this time yes they should give RSP a majority so that Balen can be our new Prime minister.    3. RSP party as a whole has never attacked them officially, they have requested them to come back but some individual RSP members have and it is their choice. RSP i feel is totally transparent like they have submitted their financial records to Election commission regularly. RSP was formed just 3 years ago and whenever a new party is formed, the only way it can get real success is via a popular face (otherwise how come only RSP got 21 seats but so many other new parties got nothing). Now soon, the general convention is gonna happen and it will sort things out.    4. Replacing the old guards is absolutely the most important thing right now and yes we need visions and plans which would be presented when RSP gets its party manifesto out and when Rabi, Balen and their other candidates begin to campaign.    At the end, I don't fault anyone for asking questions but my assertion is that most of us youths have no choice but to vote for RSP this time and try to make Balen Prime minister. Are they perfect?? Absolutely not but let's give them a chance and see for ourself and if they do bad then we will vote for someone else and if they good we will vote for them again. I'm sick and tired of Nepalis believing that we should vote for NC and UML this time and maybe they will really change. No thank you.|||>Is \"replacing the old guards\" enough for the kind of improvement we want?     What you want doesn't come out from air. What \"replacinv the old\" shows is that public still have power to change leaders if leaders don't do what they should do.

            "body": "As part of our standard check-in procedure in our hotel, when a couple arrives, we require government-issued IDs from both individuals and both signatures on the registration form.  But, I observed that we are frequently facing resistance especially when requesting the girl’s ID and signature. Most of the couple argue saying this rule exists “only in our hotel” or refuse outright. Because of this, a lot of young couples choose not to stay.  Our intention behind this policy is not to harass or embarrass anyone. There are clear reasons for it:  Both signatures confirm mutual consent to stay esp in regards to couples, protecting both guests and the hotel from future disputes or false claims.  Both IDs are important for legal accountability in case of any incident, complaint, or investigation.  Plus it also verifies the real age of both individuals, ensuring there are no underage- related legal issues.  Despite being a reputed hotel and following this policy consistently for safety and legal compliance, we’re now questioning whether this is seen as excessive.  So my genuine question is: Are we being too strict by asking for both partners’ IDs and signatures?????",

Only 1 ID was required.|||One ID is sufficient imo and have never seen asking everyone's ID in hotels in Pokhara. Chitwan. Kathmandu etc. You sure have CCTV camera in public places in hotel so that should cover most cases. I think its a bit excessive to ask both ID. There should be a sweet spot between security and privacy so asking one ID imo is good compromise.|||A significant portion of your guests are going to be couples. Your demand for both id will surely make most of the couple either go somewhere else or not return again to your hotel. Getting both signatures stating over the age of 18 for both guests can be understood but id from both guests will definitely hamper your business.|||Too much. Rights to privacy is a big thing. In case of litigation risk you're talking about, investigation will produce lots of proofs which you don't need to worry gathering yourself.|||Do your hotel specify ID of every guest are needed? Are you checking ID of everyone or just couple or just those who look young ?  Unless another person look or around under age , two ID is unnecessary. Will you refuse the family if they do not come with ID? Importantly, do you clarify it on your website or Facebook page or everywhere you post or advertise you need id of every guest ? Especially younger one ?|||Nope that should be the norm. In my experience only >3 stars rated hotels ask for IDs of all attending guests in Nepal. Tei bhayera baani naparera hola ali weirded out bhayeko plus they are scared of privacy breach because apparently it’s “nepal”, which leads me to ask you a question, what do you do with the collected info I mean how long do you keep the information?|||Nepal ma 1 ta id matra chaiyeko theo but Ive been to few other countries jata sabai jana ko id mageko theo during checkin.|||So I remember providing both of ours ID during our International travels in Europe but that probably is because of the rule in Europe. You should probably consult what the rules in Nepal are.|||Anywhere in the world, every member who stays in a hotel needs to provide ID. Please continue to follow rules, if something bad happens tomorrow in your hotel and you don’t have their sign, you will be liable for it.|||It's been just 1 ID in US/Puerto Rico/Mexico/Canada. Only time it's been 2 was when a friend booked a hotel as a gift and they weren't there, so they had to send a digital ID for verification purposes.|||Just thinking out loud. Market it as an loyalty discount or a perk?  \"Dual registration get 5% in current visit, 10% discount on their next visit\"  You say mostly young people are hesitant. Young people are also enticed by discounts.  It may not work 100% of the time but if visitors see some gain, they'll likely cooperate.  You reduce your risks, visitors gain some benefits.  Win-Win  Thank you for coming to my TED talk.|||As far as i know, a single id does the job.  The hotel staffs ask about the name and signature from both parties but never experience or heard to give both id’s.|||There was a Chinese statesman named Shang Yang who reformed the government, offending many nobles. After the king's death in 338 BC, he was wanted by the new king. He fled to an inn, but the innkeeper refused to let him in because he had no identification. He asked who had drafted the laws, and the innkeeper told him it was Lord Shang Yang. He was later captured and dismembered by five horses.

If both partners understand each other and decide not to invest heavily in gold at the beginning, it is still possible to have a meaningful and happy wedding. Marriage happens only once in life, so you can invite your close friends and relatives and enjoy a simple celebration within your budget. Everything depends on your income. If you earn well and have enough savings, you can organize a bigger wedding. Since you are living abroad and have been earning, it is understandable that you have managed to save some money. However, instead of spending a large amount on unnecessary wedding expenses, it is wiser to manage the wedding with reasonable costs and make everyone happy in a simple way. If you already know your partner well, she may not demand too much gold at this stage, which makes things easier. Even if you can afford it, giving only basic and necessary jewelry is enough. And if buying gold is difficult, a simple wedding without heavy jewelry is also completely acceptable. Rather than wasting money on a lavish wedding, it is better to invest that money in business or entrepreneurship. By doing so, you can create self-employment, build a stable future, and live with dignity in your own country.|||None, if you avoid all those.

Because of the company’s bullying culture, I decided to leave the moment I hear the terms like unpaid probation and delayed contracts. Recently i joined some company they delayed my contract letter before i signed there contract i left. Later, the bullying escalated—they even threatened legal action,  i replied  I was never an employee blocked the number returned company hoodie(  using in-drive they even asked for (khako paisa imagine how cheap these people can go), despite the fact that there was no written contract during my time there. Now that they haven’t been able to find a replacement i guess, the threats have continued.   In one of my earlier companies, there was a tea/coffee vending machine, but staff weren’t allowed to drink milk coffee. There was no restroom for clients, and meat products were banned in the shared kitchen. Major chai you have to respond the client  and company at any public days pani or attend there webinar cause India has sunday holidays.    At another company before that, the contractor tricked me into staying under an agreement where I was supposed to be paid part-time based on the number of students. The problem was that it was completely off-season thats why they hired him. Salary was based on number of students. I have to be there early morning to open there office.   At yet another company, they had a so-called one-week probation followed by a 1–3 month internship kaam salary. Even after eight months, I was still stuck as an intern, so I eventually left.  There are so many issues with Nepali private companies that talking about them never seems to end. If they can’t keep their staff happy, attracting and retaining clients is out of the question.  One thing I’ve learned: once your is salary  is issued start and once you receive another offer, it’s best to switch off the phone and do what you know is right….. they will find next bakra…   Until then, keep pushing forward—lagey raho, Munna bhai.|||Heard many horror stories regarding this company from friends, friends of friends, thrre turnover is crazy.

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now.

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

And Commenting for better reach|||Here is my recent experience if that helps:      My wife (2 years exp as Software dev) is doing Masters of IT in Melbourne. Her final semesters about to start.   She (and her friends from Uni) has been applying for Software Eng job/intern for the past 6 months. No luck yet.  I (5 years exp as Software dev) came here few months ago as her dependent. So no work restriction for me.   Started applying for Software ENg jobs, mostly through Seek and LinkedIn.   Applied to around 50-60ish places over the period of 2 months, while working at a grocery store on the side      Got reply from only 2 places where 1 one of them was a scammer.   Managed to get an actual interview in the other one (backend with Golang), where I got the job.      From what I’ve OBSERVED PERSONALLY,    \\- It seems almost impossible to get a Soft Eng intern/job as a student.    \\- You NEED to have unrestricted work rights with enough time left on your visa, or a PR to have a decent chance. I was asked to fill this info in almost every job application.   \\- It’s very very difficult to land an interview. The interview itself was not that big of a deal in my experience.    \\- If you go to regional, it becomes more difficult. a friend of mine was laid off as a software engineer like 6 months ago in Perth, still hasn’t managed to find a new job.|||Hopefully people respond to this as i am in a similar predicament|||Following|||want more comments on this|||/r/NepalAbroad|||Following",

            "body": "I’ve been on both sides of interviews, both taking them and giving them, and one pattern keeps showing up.  Different engineers can solve the same problem in very different ways, and that’s completely fine. There’s rarely a single “correct” solution. What matters much more to me is how the technical conversation is structured and how the candidate thinks through the problem when constraints and ambiguity are involved.  I’ve noticed many candidates jump straight to advanced tools or complex architectures. They can name frameworks confidently and describe setups that sound impressive. But when you dig a bit deeper and ask *why* certain choices were made, the fundamentals are often unclear. Basic trade-offs, assumptions, data size considerations, or failure scenarios are sometimes missing from the discussion.  With AI tools now widely available, writing code itself is no longer the hardest part. Generating a working solution is relatively easy. What’s harder, and far more valuable, is having a strong grasp of fundamentals: understanding the problem clearly, framing it correctly, reasoning about constraints, and explaining why a particular approach makes sense over others.  When I evaluate candidates, I don’t expect perfect or complete code. In many cases, a clear approach or even well-explained pseudo-code is more than enough. It tells me how someone thinks, how they reason, and whether they can build solutions incrementally instead of jumping straight to complexity.  I’m curious how others see this.  For those who interview regularly, how do you judge candidates? Do you prioritize fundamentals and problem-solving approach, or do tools and implementation details carry more weight for you?",

After integrating eSewa, Khalti, and ConnectIPS for the third time, I’ve decided I’m done writing \"glue code\" for every new project.  I am going to build a **Unified Nepal Payments Core** in Go.  I’m building this regardless because I need it for my own production environment, but I wanted to check with developer here if you have faced same problem and how you have solved it?  **The Problem I’m Solving (For myself, and maybe you):**  1. Architecture Mismatch: eSewa forces a legacy HTML Form POST. Khalti is JSON. ConnectIPS needs certificates. My business logic shouldn't care about these transport details. I just want a clean interface. 2. Verification Anxiety: Most tutorials I see online skip the strict signature/HMAC verification steps. I want a library that handles the crypto correctly by default so I don't have to worry about replay attacks or amount spoofing. 3. Standardized Errors: I’m tired of parsing inconsistent error responses. I want the SDK to return a standard `payment.ErrInsufficientFunds` or `payment.ErrTimeout` regardless of the underlying provider.  **The Plan:**  A \"two-layer\" architecture:  1. **Core (Open Source):** The interfaces, data models, and verification logic. 2. **Providers:** Plugins for eSewa, Khalti, IPS, etc.  **The Interface Goal:**      // 1. Setup (done once)     client := esewa.New(os.Getenv(\"ESEWA_SECRET\"))     // 2. Pay (Standard across all providers)     // I don't care if it's a Form POST or API call internally     resp, err := core.Initiate(ctx, client, &payment.Request{                  Amount: 1000,                  OrderID: \"ORD-101\",                  })  I know many developer here are Node/Python, but for the Go developers in Nepal:  1. Is this something you’d actually use in production, or do you prefer writing your own integrations to keep dependencies low? 2.

NTX gives you a quick snapshot of NEPSE listed companies - fundamentals, charts, and some mutual fund data in one place.  **Features:**  * Company details and basic info * Fundamentals (EPS, PE, ROE, P/B, etc.) * Price charts * Open-ended mutual fund holdings - see which SIP funds like NIBL Sahabhagita or Nabil Balance Fund are holding what  Live at: [https://ntx.anishshrestha.com](https://ntx.anishshrestha.com)  **Tech stack:**  * Go backend * SvelteKit frontend * ConnectRPC for typed communication between frontend and backend * Built on top of nepse-go (my other project - a Go SDK for NEPSE API)  This was mainly a learning project to get more comfortable with Go and RPC patterns. ConnectRPC generates TypeScript clients from proto definitions which keeps types in sync across the stack without manual work. Pretty nice DX if anyone's looking into it.  **Open source:** [https://github.com/voidarchive/ntx](https://github.com/voidarchive/ntx)  Fair warning - it's not a full-fledged analysis platform or anything. Just a quick way to pull up company info. Built it for my own use so there's probably edge cases I haven't handled.  If anyone wants to poke around the code, contribute, or fork it - feel free.",

What I saw was you needed to be 24x7 available in these roles(for freshers: 24x7 does not mean you do not sleep). Basically you need to pick the call whenever the manager calls you, otherwise they will keep bching about it in meetings.  So basically you will never get both work life balance and handsome pay in the field of Servers/DevOps in Nepal. Maybe with dev you can get. But malai aba dev internship kasle diyos? I tried so badly but could not get..  Companies are telling me that (MAX INT) they can pay me as much as I ask (mu mngey rkm) but I need to be available at 1AM to fix the RAM of client's servers if required.   \"Din rat yuhi sada\" jobs ma basnu parne. What I wanted is a chill job. Instead keep duty personnel in shifts. So that 24x7 availability is achieved. But testo gardaina nikamma nepali companies haru private sector ma.  (This is my experience to the extent what an average fresher can get in Nepali tech market. If it does not relate to you, happy for you!)  **Thus I decided if I were to work with servers, there is no better opportunity for me than government. Because government handles lots of data and some compute as well.**  *Not only that, if I got opportunity in NEA, I was going to get work in Smart Grid and Big Data Technologies. Basically IoT+Big Data.. Future proof shit..And get opportunities on training worldwide country visit representing Nepal ef....K....Holy ef...why only 3 VACANCIES????*   The sad reality is that vacancies are opening at a so so low rate(As per insider's information). CDSC ma 2 seat open ma, NEA ma 3 seats open ma, NEC ma 1 seat open ma, Nijamati ma 1 seat open ma. And students appearing=500,1000 etc..   PS As much as I studied(6+ months), the syllabus started to feel vaster and vaster and never ending type. I have to first understand then memorize then revise so that I can write fluently in exam. There are like total 20 subjects in average (1st+2nd paper). It is looking extremely daunting lol.   Plus the pressure from home to start earning back again.  **I could not get opportunity on remote works. I understand that because server related data are very confidential and nobody will provide remote work for it(without having a company building at Nepal). Unless it is some random person's wordpress hosting configuration. Also remote jobs kaha search garne teti saro idea ni bhayena hola...**",

So CSS for buttons, header, header title, you put your styles here    Also you can add font sizes CSS and spacing CSS here so for consistency.  For getting good at CSS just look at complex design and try to recreate it in plan html CSS for style and js for interactive|||Consistent design across a web app is driven more by design decisions than by css itself. CSS simply implements what’s already been decided. Since there are many ways to achieve the same result with CSS, if your design lacks consistent animations, reusable patterns, or a defined color system, recreating it in CSS becomes unnecessarily messy.  As a rule of thumb, I prefer to: - Define a color palette first - Design for mobile screens - Scale the design up for desktop  I design for mobile first because web apps are more likely to be used on phones, so UX should be optimized for touch, small screens, and performance. Subtle animations usually work better than flashy ones. So tone them down wherever possible.  For example, instead of redefining buttons everywhere, design a single primary button style and reuse it consistently. So when implementing the design you end up clean and reusable CSS (something like the one below).  ``` .btn-primary {   background-color: #4f46e5;   color: #ffffff;   padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;   border-radius: 0.5rem;   font-weight: 500;   transition: background-color 0.2s ease, transform 0.1s ease; }  .btn-primary:hover {   background-color: #4338ca; }  .btn-primary:active {   transform: scale(0.98); } ```  At the end of the day, the rest comes down to how well you notice design patterns and translate them into clean CSS implementations.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

Liam is lucky to have people fighting this hard for him. 💛    Huge respect for how transparent you’re being with records + receipts! That matters a lot when people want to help.

Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡",

They dated for about 6–7 months, seemed solid, then suddenly broke up. Reason? She told him, straight up, “I’m a lesbian. I like girls.” It hurt, but he accepted it and moved on. Class 12 comes. Fresh start. He likes another girl, different from the first one, proposes again, she says yes. He’s happy, confidence slowly coming back. And then… déjà vu. About a week ago, he finds out this girl is also a lesbian. But the real plot twist? His first girlfriend and second girlfriend are now dating each other. Yep. Both of them. Together. Now the whole college knows, and my guy is just standing there like a side character, wondering how his love life turned into a Netflix-level plot. At this point it’s not even bad luck, it’s just unreal. Bro didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow unlocked the rarest achievement possible 😭",

What I keep hearing from people and friends back home raises serious concerns about the tower’s commercial viability.  The issue is not the absence of a freight lift. The real issue sits with scale.  The building has a freight or service lift, but it is far too small for a high-rise of this size. Heavy furniture, industrial equipment, restaurant machinery, medical devices, or office setups will not fit or move efficiently.  In tall commercial buildings, freight lifts need large cabins and high load capacity. They support fit-outs, maintenance, and daily operations. A small service lift slows everything and forces people to misuse passenger lifts.  This reflects poor high-rise planning. Vertical transport should match the building height and purpose.  Residential use might still work. Commercial use looks compromised by design.|||Achhaaa 💯|||Tara tyo building ko barema chai aawaz uthaunu parthyo tei ko janta le. It is just staying there, usless.

No one is going to stop you lol|||Lol just don't give a sht and do whatever u want, eat whatever one and wear whatever u want or change religion. 😂 We as strangers and the law ain't judging U|||This is the ground reality check of Sanatan Rituals. Good that you raised the question. About a year ago i had to go through this procedure of 13 days for our Grandfather. I am listing Few things i had found then hope it helps:      1. Death in family can be caused with many reasons, so keeping the closest family members who shares the same house, same kitchen in a quarantine separated by cleaning with anti-bacterial natural cleaning ingredient like cow dung, ash, water - this separation for 13 days is for not communicating the disease, illness to other society members. Keeping safe distance is best way to avoid any unseen diseases.  2. Salt plays a different role in human biology - giving up salt will make you down, your metabolism decreases and your body becomes vulnerable - in this situation not having certain veggies, and food type are to keep your digestion system simple yet functional - a reminder that in life to be alive these basic things are enough for us to be alive and live.       3. For thirteen days the family members are kept in a separate space to grief, meditate, ponder meaning of life and foresee the ultimate truth - THE SATYA SANATAN.  There are certain Kriyas of Mediation to practice which is a tantrik secret and true Nepali Blood line Family members practice this till day. When you practice the kriyas you will understand why certain vegetables and food category are banned completly as you have to go inside of you in that meditation sessions -   inside of you remains the food that you ate days before are still there inside your belly - you can literally smell the days old food that you ate - imagine the smell of the vegges from inside your belly - it smells like a gutter - eWw - hence avoiding these certain types of foods to keep belly fresh that smells good when you go inside of your own body.   3.1 om shanti practinors, vaishnav, krishna Pranamis, are stirck on their diet because of this. RadhaSwami are a bit Flexible and OSHO is freaking flexible with eating rituals. But as the one goes deep inside of themselves automatically these certain food types will be avoided by the body naturally - it is a nautral process but done with reverse engineering i.e our body naturally avoids these food when we reach a certain level of being human.   4. In the garuna purana there symbolic stories where the path of enlightenment, practices and rituals are hidden - only the Nepali bloodline families know which part of the story signifies which practices and how to do it - ask Grand Parents - not as a causal question but by paying your attention, time and showing curiousness. they might feel pity and share it with you.       5. Early morning cold showers, one meal a day have tremendous positive side on how human body functions. There are supporting evidence and practices world wide.     6. People come together at this time even travelling from far away to show social mutal respect - mareKO bela ma pani BhetNa naJane -  is a taboo. You might feel like when s/he was alive people didnot cared much - true. No One can actually care for others - Aama Ba Lai kasto xa ? Sanchai Xa ? Budho hunaBhayo -yestai ho. Sewa gara, tei ho dharma bhaneko - kinda casual talks is all we get and its okay if you see it from the other side. What else you expect other to do for you and your closed ones ? you cant when it comes to other so others cant when it comes to you as well - it goes both the ways same same.   7. Different local communities have come together in Nepal to setup a KriyaPutri House equipped with decent facilities like toilets, water supply, anti-mosqutio space, safe place to be in for 13 days. This is a good initatives.       Our generation should raise questions regarding our doubts and dissatisfaction but we should be brave enough to dig in a bit deep to understand what going on really for thousands of years ? Why did it survived for thousands of years if these rituals are just bogus - rather then skipping this phenomenon as just another short video and SWIPE ->|||Fr esai ni manche mareko grief, teskai mathi etro tauko dukhai.

Vanesi, maile barnu parne ho 10 din jati tara I never did.|||Its to detach you from worldly pleasures \\*maya\\*. Salt 'ras' is the epitome of maya. Idea is basically that this realm we witness with our senses is not all there is. Theres more to human life than constantly striving for pleasurable deeds.  Have a sense of truth.  If one develops attachment to something deeply in this material world than prepare to suffer one day. However if there is sense of detachment whilst you are part of the world than you will be able to  glide being untouched by the ups and downs of dualities.  Whole idea of cultures and traditions that we are brought up with in this  south asian central regions basically nepal and india is to instill individuals with the curiosity of truth. Whatever you do go beyond what your sense organs have to offer.  Find something that is permanent. And only truth for that matter is the answer.  And also from ayurveda perspective your digestion is tanked by sudden trauma. Just how serotonin is depleted and it controls digestion too. So you take easily digested meals.  Just a perspective.|||Some rituals of banning some vegetables is definitely stupid. But overally, minimising salt is good thing for a person to do especially stress due to lost ones raises overall bp, but obviously completely avoiding sodium isn't good. Eating fruits is also good for health. I used to think if someone close passes by, it's better to leave them some space. But it's kinda wrong as you need to surround yourselves with people this will helps lowering coristol. Obviously, people should also be supportive. One definite problem is it may be a financial burden to the family. |||Kabir Das rightly said,   जिंदा बाप कोई न पूजे, मरे बाद पूजवाए, मुट्ठी भर चावल लेके, कौवे को बाप बनाए।|||Andhabiswas le varieko desh|||I didnt quiet saw this in the comments so , everything about food restrictions is about diseases the food might carry and people visiting after death is not about paying respect to the dead person or anything , its about who remains, how they deal after the death of someone close.

Idk why this quote hit me after reading your third paragraph.|||Every ritual in the past has a reason, I am not supporting the blind follow up people do now a days. But people offer fruits as a sustenance to the affected family and remove the burden of cooking on their part. And one more reason is, our body starts decomposing within 24 hrs , if placed in a warm climate. The smell you get near a dead body is actually the body particles disposing into air. They spread everywhere, your house, utensils, every room and so on. So people are instructed to clean everything in the house as soon as possible. This also results in them not being able to use utensils at home to cook . The fruits offered are for sustenance and energy to go through the ordeal. Also most fruits are easy to digest and give good energy and fiber too.  But in modern times this doesn't make sense if a person expires in hospital or when we have food deliveries. But it is not easy to remove age old traditions at the drop of the hat because we got instant delivery. And these concerns might be valid in cities, but can we say the same regarding rural places ?|||It sounds rough but I have a theory.

First of all I'm not an expert but I can feel the necessity of doing rituals.  Simple as is said budha pakhale vaneko Mannu vancha ni as they have experienced most then us, instead of saying frustuation you could have asked about why is it necessary performing such rituals with you relatives or brahmins.  Main kura what I can feel is, if you have loved the person most who died you wouldn't have asked such foolishness. aafno lagi important manche ko lagi you cannot give 13 days, then I don't think you have loved them as you should have. Take a example if it's your partner that you love most, if needed ain't you gonna sacrifice your life for your partner?? Or you just selfish, Ill live alone and you may die?? Another important fasting reason for me is again think of it as like you broke up with your first love.. so how is it going to be for you for few days huh?? Mental problems, depression, suicidal thoughts aaucha in Esto if you really loved and you got recently separated.. so to avoid those think of this as a period that you are trying to build yourself up when the person you lived the most isn't around you anymore. You are trying to get strength from the level 0. These are just simple explanation for you to understand easily the necessity of rituals.  The main reason of rituals is something else. It goes like the Soul needs 13 days to fully leave from the earth. By performing rituals you are guiding the soul to the heaven. The fasting is not purification for you to cleanse up, it's still for the dead person.   Ani about your relatives coming bringing fruits, why. Are you mad bro?? Are you lonely your all life?? Just as you are saying it's hard for you to perform 13 days rituals how can you expect other relatives to come everyday looking up for sick dying people when every person is busy in their life.. be thankful atleast they showed up when needed..   Ewta important life lesson: janmida eklei janimye Pani manche katiko ramro thyo vanne kura mare pachi matra tha huncha.. even if you are born alone, dying alone is a really bad thing. Atleast marepachi malami Kati aayo vanda bujhnu sakincha how important that person was for all those people.

Culture provides us with the blue print as to the course of action to take during events like death. The brain hates uncertainty and during such events we would be utterly dumbfounded and paralyzed if we wiped out everything dictated by culture. We have formed societies and countries around us just so that we feel more secure and rituals help bolster the cohesion of the social fabric by getting us to coperate with one another.

It started with our grandfather's generation \"the vision of BP\" then came the cunt generation of \"GP Koirala\" and this power hungry illiterate Sher Bahadur. And now since people are asking for some young faces Gagan found the right time to play this move.   If you look at those people who are there in \"youth congress\" or whatever it is called who are trying to set a narrative, they are kids of aristocrats and belong to a family who are politically inclined to Congress because that party has always prioritized them and their businesses.

He had been constantly rising voice against deuba and his associates, he openly criticized NC coalition in election and he also openly said he was against forming of government with UML but majority crushed him, left high level committes of netas created during NC-UML government (indicates he strongly opposed it). firstly have to know about him. Yes he is not the best, but among the choices in NC, he is best. He also ran against Deuba in samsadiya dal inside NC and lost to him(this was just after 79 election)  Everyone says he shows himself as saviour just before election (I gave some data before), yes he should be doing now. Before Gen-z he had been doing it in slow-process but when Gen-z happened he understood his pace is not good and increased his activity. Politics is also game of numbers, before Gen-z majority were aligned to Deuba or were scared of his cartels, but why he did only after Gen-z and 20yrs after being in politics is because,  1. it is only recently when he held substantial power in NC where his voice mattered. Before he was mere MP(there ary many of them) and didn't held any major post inside NC and held just recently. If he had done before, he would have been thrown out of party and this agenda wouldn't have been carried out by anyone. He would have been the BHIM RAWAL of congress. Watch in UML what happened, when one impulse guy, without any strategies and planning went all against Oli. He was thrown out of party yes, but that voice was also changed. 2. He did this after Gen-z(not to take anything with election, if election wasn't announced, NC would have done normal convention) because it was only this time when others were also not satisfied with the Deuba. He just lead this thought of people inside congress dissatisfied and mandate he got from Gen-z that your pace is not good, do decisive, we have heard enough of you. If gen-z wouldn't have happened, everyone would have been aligned with deuba himself, and Gagan didn't had number so, he would have lost the movement and got the punishment from the Leadership. He did this (risking his political career), slowly planning, making strategies and having sense, this time he wouldn't loose. **\\[which shows he has better planning ability to get the result he wanted and this is kind of ability everyone wants is their leader\\]**  Yes, he is not best, but what happening in NC is good. Old should also get filtered. Once this old were the present RaSwaPa and they happend to be this, we need perfect Check and Balance. If NC wouldn't have did this, RaSwaPa would have got much higher seat and they would have done whatever they wanted which is wrong. We want multiple stakeholders who listen and feels the general public and NC is being transformed to that and the man leading Gagan much respect to him.  btw, for this time, my vote is for Ghanti hai (still not best, but among alternative, good than others)|||Nepal doesn’t need another PM who learns governance on the job while the bureaucracy runs circles around them. That experiment has already failed  repeatedly.  The fantasy that “outsiders are pure, insiders are dirty” is childish. Power doesn’t work that way.  You don’t dismantle a cartel by appointing someone who doesn’t even know its hierarchy. You do it by putting in charge someone who knows exactly which doors to kick, which ones to lock, and which ones to burn down.  This is why someone like Gagan Thapa is a more serious PM candidate than any political outsider fantasy.|||Thikei cha aba herum k huncha.

In a multi party democracy, party is an institution just like CIAA, election comissions etc and he is actually making policy changes to choose electoral candidate more democratically.

He is a beacon of hope in this fight between inexperienced populist and the establishment with syndicate.|||People believing rabi balen and kulman are better leaders really baffles me!

He would have ended up in Jail like Rabi Lamichanne.  A real anti-corruption leader doesn’t get protection from corrupt parties, he gets attacked by them. Rabi was silenced because he shook the old parties. Rabi was forcefully jailed because of this. Gagan is fake leader & get exposed every year. He is a mastermind manipulator & a corrupt leader.  That difference alone shows who the real threat to the system was.|||He never wanted a normal adhiveshan because he would have lost to either Shekhar, Nidhi, or any Deuba-close one. A bishesh adhiveshan at the right time will make him party president for sure. Had Deuba simply conducted a normal adhiveshan this month, even after Gagan announced a bishesh adhiveshan, Gagan would have lost the party presidency election. This time, Gagan’s strategy worked. Deuba and his group are called buda neta for a reason. Dumb Deuba. Aba Gagan le Deuba lai ticket diyo vane? Sachikai sachiyeko hota?|||You can't improve our country's politics without improving old parties, which are still huge. In politics, you cannot speak whatever you like when you don't have the power to back it up. I think Gagan was also building up his influence within the Party.|||1. No one is squeaky clean- Balen, Gagan, Ravi, Harka no one.  2. There are different degrees of bad - Gagan is probably a mid, doesn’t deserve so much hatred. Of his mistakes he did cross a line against Rabi, didn’t need to and it didn’t help him in anyway bad move but it wasn’t a corrupt move.  3. we should want all parties to clean up their systems where they can- in that respect he is making the most sense. In fact Swarnim and Gagan if you listen to their interviews they have the most positive agenda driven views instead of diatribe negativity against everyone else who is not them.|||Cunning and Rabi are synonymous… and I don’t mind including Gagan too|||Obviously he wins|||Bad ra worst ma kun thik vanya jastai ho.

The multiparty system, built on the premise of democracy, was far more important for the country. Although it would have taken time for the system to function effectively and for citizens to truly practice democracy, it was a necessary and valuable process.  This system was destroyed through false promises, manufactured hope, and baseless allegations. By exploiting the corruption of a few politicians at the time, and instead of educating the people, innocent citizens were dragged into a civil war. The tourism sector once a key revenue generator collapsed, while agriculture, the backbone of the nation, was severely weakened.  As a result, the country has been pushed back by decades, losing entire generations of progress. All of this traces back to a corrupt process, influenced and engineered by foreign powers to weaken and destabilize the nation, and enabled by this one man. Today, the mass departure of citizens has become a major contributor to the economy through remittances an outcome born of necessity, not progress.  Yet many people remain unaware of these realities. One cannot help but wonder: when will people finally grow up and confront the truth?  And if he wins the election again, it should surprise no one.",

I am loving it when the huge crowd of people are chanting Jai Nepal (not the jai nepal for nepal but jai nepal as a party slogan).

Probably because the party is heading towards breakdown and I am loving the scenario? Probably because UML were doing things that was against the public emotion but Congress are actually acknowledging the public voice?

They are taught like , corruption is the every people careers path.  This fucking needs to be stopped. The campus students union should be independent of the political party.

            "body": "Consent is not a blanket permission. It’s specific, situation-based, and ongoing. If this still sounds abstract, here are everyday and sexual scenarios that make it very clear.  Everyday, non-sexual scenarios (so it’s easier to understand):  • You invite a friend into your house to sit in the living room.  That does NOT mean they can enter your bedroom.  • You lend someone your phone to make a call.  That does NOT mean they can scroll through your gallery.  • You agree to help someone with homework.  That does NOT mean you agreed to do the entire assignment for them.  • You say yes to tea.  That does NOT mean yes to alcohol.  Nobody argues these examples. Everyone understands limits here.  Now apply the SAME LOGIC to sexual situations:  • You agree to making out.  That does NOT mean you agreed to intercourse.  • You agree to oral sex.  That does NOT mean penetration is allowed.  • You say “I’m not ready for sex” beforehand.  That boundary still applies later unless you clearly say otherwise.  • You say “no sex” and the other person says “okay” and does it anyway.  That’s not miscommunication. That’s a violation.  • You freeze, go quiet, or don’t push them away.  That is NOT consent. Freezing is a common fear response.  • Your body reacts (wetness, erection, moaning).  That is a physical reflex, not permission.  A very realistic scenario:  Person A: “I’m okay with kissing and touching, but no sex.”  Person B: “Okay, I won’t.”  Later, Person B penetrates anyway because “things got heated.”  That is not an honest mistake.  That is knowingly crossing a stated boundary.  If someone knows the difference between touching and penetration (they do), then they know exactly what they’re doing.  “But stopping is hard when you’re aroused”  Being aroused doesn’t remove responsibility. Adults are expected to control themselves.  If arousal justified crossing boundaries, consent would be meaningless.  Nepalese law:  Under Nepal’s Muluki Criminal Code, sexual intercourse without free and voluntary consent is sexual assault or more specifically rap..e .  Consent is invalid if:  • It was never given  • It was withdrawn  • It was ignored after refusal  • The person froze or was unable to resist  • It was obtained through pressure or deception  The law does NOT say:  • “Consent is automatic once sexual activity starts”  • “Silence means yes”  • “Changing your mind doesn’t count”  If someone says “you can do X but not Y”, that is not confusing.  That is a boundary.  Ignoring it is a choice, not an accident.  Consent is simple.  People only call it “complicated” when they don’t want accountability.

So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

It was essentially 60 rs for the whole month, but it was often enough to kill time.|||Ohh. Massive nostalgia.   My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Crazy nostalgia.

I'm a white guy that was born here. I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation.

Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

I threw the cigarette and the freshly bought pack in the bin and that was it.  It’s been 6 months now. Haven’t touched one since.  Yeah, the urge came back once or twice, mostly while drinking. But I didn’t give in. Every time I didn’t, it felt like a small win.  Honestly, quitting smoking is the best decision I’ve ever made.  If you’re young or just getting into it, QUIT NOW. It’ll suck for a few days, maybe weeks. But you’ll get through it. And that win stays with you for life.  If I could walk away after 10 years, you can too.",

Was having some urges to smoke but i suddenly saw your post. Its magic . Once nicotine enters again it wont go for next 72 hours. i have already came far enough. So i will not take in again. Its a win|||So, this happened. After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.  After finally catching him up, i tried to have a normal convo with him. there were only two of us who found and caught him at that time. we were waiting for others to come. my another friend went out to bring water for him. Suddenly, he leveraged the situation to run away from me. I got injured in my head and hand  Then i tried chasing him. The only thing in my mind was, dude it took so long and effort to finally find him. He was attempting to harm himself at times. So, we couldn't let him get away. But i couldn't keep up. **Years of smoking, and long hours at work finally caught up.** Here, i am supposed to be the most athletic in the group.  I couldn't keep up with this rogue guy. I got tired instantly. It really sucked. We were finally able to catch him. The dude tried to hit me up with stones and all. but i managed to get hold of him.  I have not smoked since and i don't intend to ever again. Also, i left the job|||Congratulations 🎊|||Agree with you!! You can't plan on quitting it has to be sudden with no backups or cheeky puffs!!   Stopped smoking since may 2023 its been a life changing decision. And about the urge to smoke it never left me. After 2yrs when i see someone smoke on the roadside i get the urge to smoke. Ig once you started smoking the urge will last forever just don't loose to that urge.   And you'll be so proud of yourself|||Life won't get any better. I quit for 4 years and started again.|||👍🏼|||For anyone who is looking for quitting app, would love to see your reviews with dhuwa.com its an smoking replacement and awareness app, just give it a try, if anyone needs it|||Good on you mate|||That is great for you.  Hoping you have a long healthy life|||Congratulations Bro! Keep it up|||Sorry, but nicotine doesn't let you leave without paying a price.|||Well done bro!  I quit smoking cigarettes and weed couple of years ago. Weed ta aboh kaam ma Drugs and Alcohol test le garda kheri ho tara cigarettes was coz one morning I was at work and some guy walked in after smoking. Teti bela I just started thinking to myself, is this how bad I smell and does everyone in the office look at me disgusted like I am doing right now? So tya bata I just stopped smoking automatically. I also threw away all my packs.  Later on I got urges to smoke after couple of months and that’s when I fucked up… I started vaping and that shit was too addictive than cigarettes because you can literally vape in your room, car anywhere… so it took me a while to decide to stop vaping too after 3 years…   Whatever you are all doing, please don’t turn to vaping thinking it will help you quit cigarettes… it will just reverse everything!  To all the quitters, please stay strong 💪🏼|||crazy|||Great job. I did that with weed. Decided this is my last one and it has been 7 years haven't smoked any.  I'm using vape to quit smoking but I'm happy with smoking 1 pack every year.",

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

            "body": "Hi, I’m a 20-year-old student and freelancer who genuinely wants to build something meaningful in life.  After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)

            "body": "Yesterday I posted about how I felt like a Pathao for my girlfriend, and almost everyone agreed that I was being used. So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡",

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Murti haru ko taskaar ma ni naam aauchha re. Ani yes he did monetized shrinkhala. Shrinkhala chose wrong man to marry that to added hate towards her. Her father is also someone who couldn't do anything be it due to corruption or sth else.|||Anyway, Shoutout to Ajay Thapa magar a self Made Man he is a Good guy and a inspiration for me 🫡|||I have been Sisan’s vlog’s fan since his earliest day. Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex. While whole nation was burning , i lost respect on him.  He is such a hypocrite|||Vanesi Binayak chai gatilo guy nei ho ki?

From him i found out Shrinkhala was double dating, sisan and kantipur ko malik ko son.|||Idk how much of what said is even true but I never really liked his image. Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog. I also dont like Shrinkhala though.|||[deleted]|||Source-trust me bro|||Haha. I thought people saw through Baniya. But still believing him, sympathising him 😂 you all are played!|||I once read a reddit post which claimed Aishwarya and Amitabh were in a relationship and to stay at the same place without anyone suspecting, she married to Abhishek.|||Lol. I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

Heard about it from someone close to his circle (someone from television), but could never verify.|||It interesting to see how hating on Shrinkhala has become like a cool thing and people are just like yeah  don't love her but yeah some of this is true. What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

            "body": "Hello everyone, I need some guidance.  Maile yo pali BSc Microbiology maa join gareko chu (as a backup) and the college asked for my original migration certificate, which I have already submitted, because if i didnt, i would not be able to give exams and that would lead me to drop.  Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||Man this post is a circle jerk of cognitive bias. There’s definitely people that side with the ban, but to act like it’s objective truth based on your shitty personal experiences is so dumb.   Did you mind read all the aunties and uncles and kids that work at the gas stations? Lol  We are supposed to be   like yea everyone is out here very very very happy about the ban, giant big celebrations and fireworks.|||Some of them will be harassed. They don't care about immigration status, they care about color of your skin!|||There may be some who do that but hey, the majority of people are nice, one can only think better for others. So I am obviously pissed about this new change for Nepal.|||It comes time , may be one day they need to come back too ! Just Trump lai Aunshi purne lagnu parchha 😀|||they think that makes them superior and in nepal going aboard is still taken as huge deal thats all.|||Hmm generalizing blatantly. So typical.   I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce.

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.

So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

Rabi was obviously playing the long game, but Balen is also in it for the long run. If the RSP wins the election and Balen becomes PM, it could be a fresh start for the country. This is arguably the best outcome among all possible scenarios. The old political leaders will do everything in their power to silence RSP, but the main goal should be ensuring a fair election and the highest voter turnout possible. The youth need to go out and vote. It’s now or never.|||[removed]|||[removed]|||My biggest disappointment is they all preach as anti establishment. But they can't still come together to show an alternative path. Untill now, we should see me news like this. Shows how most of them are driven primarily by personal ambitions.  I think most of new leaders wil go to elections independently this time. To see how much vote their party gets. And then they will start doing collations like its been the culture.|||Why balen want to have state and state ministers, why balen want to have samanupatik seat, why balen doesnt want directly elected prime minister.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police.

Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

So I have two questions;  1. How do I make the insertion easy? Are there any tips, tricks whatsoever?   2.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that. Refer bina kehi chaldaina vanera fail banaunu I selected one random cv and happy that he is doing good job.|||Always try to keep personal and professional life separate.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it.

You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

You should go two ways:-  1) Report at police's cyber bureau.  2) Do self investigation. Police is slow, case like yours is matter of everyday for them. So, try following:-  - Is their phone still ringing? If yes try as a new client from new number, new voice (friend) and try to meet before paying. If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

            "body": "Hi, I’m a 20-year-old student and freelancer who genuinely wants to build something meaningful in life.  After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions.

Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.

This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

Liam is lucky to have people fighting this hard for him. 💛    Huge respect for how transparent you’re being with records + receipts! That matters a lot when people want to help. And yes, thank you Elevidys (and the teams behind it) for giving families a real shot at hope.    Boosting this: if you can’t donate, please share. Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡",

Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

These both are extreme examples.The guy in this post came to USA to study bachelor with full financial and social responsibility. Doing bachelor is always tough while working illegally for 4 years. I don’t encourage people to go for bachelor degree with their sole financial responsibility. With more effort and research, people end up in scholarship and low tuition fee college.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

            "body": "Hello everyone, I need some guidance.  Maile yo pali BSc Microbiology maa join gareko chu (as a backup) and the college asked for my original migration certificate, which I have already submitted, because if i didnt, i would not be able to give exams and that would lead me to drop.  Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",
