Build gradually. Stop comparing yourself with other and change into the mindset of collaboration. Maybe see a psychologist, but they are so expensive these days. Put effort into things you really enjoy. Be comfortable with solitude. You know what you want to do - try and do it. Nothing has happened at 22. I was on the same boat, gradually I'm getting better.

Somehow we realize things when we are on the go. Doesn’t matter what. And I just needed realization, coz everything else was not that bad, just not making any sense to me.

I have also faced anxiety couple of years ago. After so much of mental struggle it only conclude that Only faith is the solution. We often try to deal anxiety with logical mind but that cause more anxiety. Just have faith in god a superior being and have faith that this phase of life only make u strong to face even big problem in future. Time heals everything.    Talking about social skills u need to improve slowly that takes time. But the same thing have a blind faith that u will eventually grow and be that person u want to be.  Another secret tip use positive affirmations. Say to yourself that u are excellent social person. Fake it till u make it thats the key. Giving my personal experience I used to be very under confident man. But then i started to tell myself that \"i am the best \". Initially i used to think that i was lying to myself but as i continued to tell this one thing about myself I changed and today I really believe that I am the best and sulerconfident person. Some time i can be narssistic in fact that crazy 🤣.  So thats how it works.. bro have faith and talk positively to urself and also focus on your physical health as mind is connected to body.  God bless u brother i hope it will help u|||aau bro chya khana jam|||I’m also 22 and I too suffer from depression sprinkled with ADHD 😊. I graduated 6 months ago and I haven’t been able to land a single job, no matter how hard I try. Seeing my classmates, who are less skilled than me landing high paying jobs at big corporations makes me feel like shit.  I don’t know what went wrong since I was always a good student with above average grades.    But, despite all of this, I haven’t given up. I used to get severe ancient attacks but Ive learned to get out of it. I have realized that fixating on negative aspects will make your problems worse and it’ll never let you grow. I start my day smiling with full of hope and even if things don’t go the way I expected I go to bed smiling.   The best thing you can do is to have a positive attitude and get out of your comfort zone. Don’t give a shit about what others might say. If you feel like everyone is judging you and your actions, say to yourself, “who do I think I am that everyone has their eyes on me?” Everyone has their own problems and nobody has time to judge others.    Only you can help yourself. The world will not end if you have few awkward moments.   HELP YOURSELF. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.|||Well... You see, to think about talking, is living in the future? That causes anxiety. If you say you don't know how to speak to people what is it you are thinking about when you imagine talking to someone. I spent 10 years in therapy, still need it sometimes, I took medication for another 10 years. And truthfully my life changed, BUT, and this is the most important thing about it; therapy and meds didn't make me talk or overcome my anxiety, actually doing it made the change and it eventually became permanent.   Think of it as learning to walk, you may not remember but there was a time when you tried to walk and fell and decided to stop trying. But fear hadn't taken hold of you yet. So you tried again. And did better but still failed but you kept trying. I guess today you are walking just fine.  I started talking to elderly people, they want to be heard and to hear people, take the time to chat with them. Ask for advice, they've lived so much without the cures of our times and overcame them.  It is also true that I've accepted the fact that I don't really like talking a lot, even if sometimes I have a lot to say, and finding that definition of yourself helps a lot, you don't have to be as talkative as anyone else, or as extroverted as anybody. You have to be you, and if you don't want to talk it's ok, but if you need to do it, free yourself from the shackles of fear, one step at a time, one word at a time, one chat at a time. Do not expect the outcome, be surprised when one day you'll find yourself remembering a time when you couldn't even think of talking outspokenly.   As for the existing. My friend, life is about experiencing existence. What I'm saying is, it's not about you deciding on your existence, but in experiencing everything this existence has to offer, the good, the bad, the wonderful, the sad. Change your focus, from you, to the world around you.  I know all this is easier said than done. I know you've heard all or some of this before. But with the passing years, I've started to understand, it's like chips falling into place, the same advice I heard in my youth and couldn't grasp it, now resonates strongly in my mind. Seek knowledge, about you and the world around you and the pieces will start filling the emptiness of doubt, and, as the elder so often say, eventually you'll understand.   Chat me up if you wanna talk sometime, I can't promise to answer quickly but I'll definitely answer. Besides writing is easier than talking, right?|||Have u tried reading some self-help books?

I used to have issues with self harm, alcohol abuse and self hatred. I used to do self harm everyday but it's been over 3 years and I don't have these issues anymore.   One thing to say though: trauma never truly leaves you, you find better ways to cope but getting rid of core trauma requires upwards of 12 years of therapy and it's even worse for people with complex PTSD.   The first thing you should do is realise you need help and you need to treat yourself like your own mentor. You are your own best friend and your own personal trainer. Whenever you have thoughts like \"I'm worthless\", \"noone will care if I die\", you need to challenge these points like a best friend. Remember: NOONE and I mean NOONE is worthless because worth is a human made term. It doesn't mean anything since it's defined by outside influence.    For example: 500 rupees is worth more than 50 but there is no law in the universe that says this, we humans made up these terms because they made sense in a market driven society. Other than that, self worth (how you view yourself in relation to others) is something you yourself have to be able to set. I'm not asking you to say you're worth as much as gold over night but the goal is to slowly start to question and argue with your inner thoughts.   Take it slow, this shit takes YEARS. One day at a time. Force yourself to do something, anything. Being in nature is especially good to start. Once you feel more comfortable going outside, set further goals: maybe go on a trek. This style of training is something you can do for ALL your fears.   I conquered social anxiety for example by forcing myself to speak up. I remember at my uni, my legs were shaking and my voice was stuck in my throat on every sentence and my mind suddenly went \"you're doing it again. You're making a fool of yourself\".   Don't worry you can do it. We're all adults now, we're all people with busy lives, teenager bullies are likely not to exist anymore, they're out of that phase. You HAVE to understand that. Most people are kind, believe me and if they see you're really trying to communicate, they'll most likely appreciate it.   You're not alone, man. Even if the world doesn't give a shit if you exist or not, you dictate that. You have the ability to jump off a bridge or keep on living, nobody has any right to take away your life from you, you hold that entirely in your hands.   Any decision you make from tomorrow will have to be strategic: do something valuable to yourself and reward yourself. Say: you went outside for the first time in a week, so you treat yourself with your favourite food. You need to celebrate any small goals you achieve. Those small goals add up to a big one.   You get to dictate your own worth, my guy. That's the ONE thing you have control over even if EVERY other aspect of your life is against you. Even if you're at the bottom of the barrel, your worth never changes.|||You just need to tackle the embarrassment and cringe head on. The only way you're going to get through that is just to experience it. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It's going to be hard at first but you'll soon realize it wasn't so bad.|||Find something to do. Always. Walk, hike, cycle.   Watch people go on about their daily life. ANYTHING.   Ofc you don’t know how to make friends, nobody does. But we can learn right? And making friends and conversations is a two way street. Be genuine with it. People are more likely to open up if you are open yourself AND DON’T mind those hurt souls who are stuck in their own self made bullshit world and is negative all around.   “Beggars cannot be choosers.”, I used to think to myself. This is not a negative self-talk though, mind that, its just a perspective, go and put yourself out there, take the fall, eat them rejection, you’ll learn much, embrace it for one day you might realise that is what you have missed out on such in life.|||Try meditation, and look into spirituality a little bit as well. Also if you take marijuana, try to quit it. Apparently makes anxiety much worse. See if you can find a hobby you can enjoy. Meditation and psychedelics helped me a lot. Of course you can not cure it with medication, but you can make it manageable.|||watch spiderman or bunch of superhero movies, watch shwetabh gangwar (if u understand hindi)|||Talk to somebody, reach out to somebody even if you can think of one person, like you let it out here, it gives u relief, start with one or two people, you dont have to make a lot of friends. Start with a loved one you can speak to.

            "body": "So lately I have been seeing more and more Sherpa people online saying Tashi Delek is their language like huh?? 😭 I get that after migration they formed their own identity and culture and that’s totally fine ..I actually respect that but what bothers me is they never give credit or even acknowledge where it came from.  I saw this Sherpa girl in some Europe based community video (like SFT or RTYC type thing) say “I’m Sherpa living in Europe ofc I speak Sherpa… Tashi Delek.” andddd I nicely commented saying just fyi Tashi Delek is actually Tibetan bro the way a bunch of Sherpa people jumped on me in the comments like I wasn’t even rude I said it in the kindest way possible.  It’s not the first time either every time a Tibetan brings it up they get so defensive instead of just saying “yeah it came from Tibetan.” like no one is denying Sherpa has its own culture now but historically Sharpa literally means “people from the East” (Eastern Tibet). That’s literally where it comes from.  And I have been saying this for years about Kham Chupa I told my friends eventually after a decade later I think Sherpa people will clam kham Chupa as thr and my friends were like “nah u are overthinking” but now it’s actually happening. I’m seeing Sherpa people wear Kham chupa wrong and calling it their traditional dress… like please at least learn what u are wearing before claiming it   And the funniest part? There are a bunch of Sherpa people attacking us Tibetans saying “attack Tamang people too like why you guys always attacking Sherpas?” Like?? I have literally never seen Tamang people claim Tibetan culture as theirs.. they actually give credit when it’s due so why even bring them up? It’s weird that Sherpas (who are also Nepali btw) are the ones asking us to “attack Tamangs too” like what ugh  Idk man every time I try to educate them it turns into an argument. I even had random Sherpas DM me stuff like “I support CCP” or “I love that they took your country.” like that’s insane… have some shame. Your great grandparents were literally Tibetan even the one you guys are the most proud , the first mountaineer on Everest, Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, was Tibetan matter of fact his father Ghang La Mingma and mother Dokmo Kinzom were both Tibetan so like… what are we doing here?? All we asked is give credit and thn somehow they always brings up how happy they are that we lost our country , they are overjoyed that China took our country . Oh wow  Anyway I’m honestly just curious what Nepalis think about this whole thing like from your perspective!! do you guys also notice this cultural mix up or is it just something Tibetans tend to pick up on more?  (Also sorry if this sounds rude or aggressive.. I swear I’m chill while typing this just genuinely curious and trying to say it nicely hehe )",

You are not a country or a monolith anymore.   Nepal took in Tibetan refugees since 1950 I think. Well over 50 years ago.    How hard is it ro understand? Sherpa, Mustang, Manang people were at some point heavily influenced by or directly of Tibetan ancestry. When a nomadic group settle in a new region and a new country, they become integrated into that country's culture. So yeah Sherpas say 'Tashi Delek'. They're ethnically Tibetan in their roots at a point. But since they're nationally Nepali, they're going to say they're Nepali.    Whats the issue? Sherpas and other Tibetan-ancestry people in Nepal have to sign a petition to say that their culture was Tibetan influenced and give you a receipt or kiss your ring?    Half of your families live in Nepal? Do we need to ask you to produce a receipt and give us credit for all of your families who have managed to call Nepal a home? |||Nepali word kursi(chair). There are other countries which use the same word for it like India, Indonesia etc. I don't see anybody arguing about it. There's many more of these common words used in various countries. Everyone just says it's their language, don't fight over it. Done. That's how it should be.|||The language spoken in Easter tibet was eastern Tibetan dialect (similar to Kham Tibetan) along with classic Tibetan (spoken by buddhist monks). Since we’ve been speaking some form of Tibetan, living in Tibet, Embracing the Buddhist teaching and language before the migration. Would it be wrong to say that words like Tashi Delek is and has been a form of greeting in our language for a long time?  Sherpas or other Buddhist follower in different parts of Nepal has been wearing different forms of chupa forever. But since technological development and recent mass migration of Tibetan refugees brought their cultures with them to Nepal. The “Sherpas” must’ve thought of embracing the same culture as their ancestors as well. Thus, resulting in starting to wear the newer style “Tibetan chupa” what you call kham chupa.|||It’s frustrating to see some Sherpa people claim Tibetan words and traditions like “Tashi Delek” or Kham Chupa without acknowledging their origins, especially when you try to explain it respectfully and get attacked for it. No one denies Sherpa culture has evolved uniquely, but giving credit to Tibetan roots shouldn’t be so hard.|||Well it was a Nepali princess and a Chinese princess who gave Tibet it's Buddhism. If Sherpas have to be grateful to Tibetans for giving them an identity, then by that logic Tibetans should first be grateful to Nepalis for giving them Buddhism and their identity and stop appropriation of Buddhism. Makes sense? No? Then neither does your rant here do.|||Go Bark on Tibetan subs . We support our own .

He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.

Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??

Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area.

Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election.

Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country.

My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

            "body": "I want to share my wife’s story because I hope it helps someone who might be going through something similar. It's been a tough two years for us, and I’ve learned a lot the hard way.  After 2 years of getting married to my wife. In December 2023, we got the news no one ever wants to hear. My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

Some lack knowledge, others just don’t care about patient. Most MBBS graduates can’t even get license in first try. There’s also little consequence for doctor mistake because of doctor shortage in Nepal and all doctors protesting if anyone is prosecuted. Even doctors I know suggest to go to India or other country for any serious health issue. |||>After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  why Nepali doctors are like this, afule nasakne ho bhane.. aru doctor lai kina refer gardainan.. aru ko jindagi sanga kina helchekrai garchan ..  tetro time, pain.. mental health.. paisa.. tesai kharcha bhayena..  complain garna mildaina teo Dr. Sharma lai ??     good to hear your wife is healthy now and back to normal life|||So happy for you and your wife, Dai. It takes a huge toll on your mental health when someone you love is ill. This is equivalent to getting a new life. Also, I'm proud of you on how you handled the situation and how much you love your wife bhanera.|||Tapaiko jasto critical case ta thiyena mero. Back ko surgery hunu parne thiyo.

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%. After two years of fear, stress, and uncertainty, my wife is finally healthy. Biggest lessons: don’t rush medical decisions, always get multiple opinions, trust your instincts, ask questions, and stay hopeful.  If you want, I can also help you turn your story into a **Reddit-friendly version**, or prepare titles like:  * *“2-Year Brain Tumor Journey: Why You Must Always Get a Second Opinion”* * *“Thought We Lost Everything. Turns Out We Just Needed One Better Doctor.”*  Want a more emotional version, shorter version, or a version without doctor names?|||Hope u are feeling better, brother. Vauju lai mero tarfa bata 1kg anar dinu hai|||If you have money, don't ever do anything serious medical stuff in Nepal. What happened to OP is unfortunately common. My aunt had a similar experience where the doc said immediate surgery but her family decided to wait and instead went straight to Thailand. The doc over there said that it WASN'T even serious. Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again.

School time ma, school ko responsibilities pura garna nasake ma punishment or fine hunnu parne regardless the reason. but saying teachers cannot participate in politics event is un enforceable. also this should be done by LokSewa not EC.  plus not only teacher every public service employee if goes to any event without proper holiday should be punished or fine, mero normal job jastai. i can participate but in my expense of time off. i can talk about politics in office too.  \"political events\" ma teacher le baag lina na paaune is un enforceable. freedom of expression ko against ma bhayo.   promotion of parties within schools can be prohibited  but easy workaround can do it just outside the schools. inside i understand it should be. but still un enforceable.   \"bias in teaching low garne re\", human bias ko against  enforce chai kasri garcha?  schools and universities are hot bed for politics and ideology, most democratic countries in universities and schools people participate in politics, that's where movements are born. only student movement topples governments. so thinking this is enforceable by a body like EC is absurd to me. good to appease people.   I am not saying these student unions currently aren't bad, they are spineless corrupt cowards, similar to teacher unions ko cowards but this is a just a document to appease people who think this is enforce able.   now every student (even for lols) will post the pictures of any teacher they find, imagine you fearing your right to expression. \"mob justice\"|||Can someone explain how this is a good decision? From what I can tell, it restricts an individual’s freedom of expression. Yes, government school teachers are public servants, but what they do outside their working hours shouldn’t be the government’s concern. They have every right to hold opinions and express them. Also, how far do these restrictions actually go? Are teachers even allowed to show support for their preferred representatives on social media|||I think this is a right decision but I want some perspectives from the opposing side…",

Regardless it was during start of COVID and expenses for my treatment went over 14 lakhs  Because everyone refuses to admit me in a hospital,   Mom and dad somehow begged money from relatives and neighbour at 14% interest rate  After operation it took 3 years for me to properly walk  first few months I couldn't stand properly and walking was impossible almost a year I was bedridden   That ruined my mental health so much I started to go crazy  I started believing \" I was a god born into human body and me being human was mine decision to experience sadness\" You know crazy shit  I went to multiple hospital and clinic where specialists came for checkup  As far as I remember I had 5 doctors who treated me   2 of them were psychologist who accused me of faking it or not having any problems  Or you depressed ,the phschologis from clinic said I have mood disorder idk what that means gave  me some meds  And the one from OM HOSPITAL SAID ya ,I got bipolar, borderline personality disorder,ADHD and depression  Gave me enough drugs to feel like a zombie  And all that cost around 5 lakh for 2 years or so treatment .  Then ya drop out bhayo  Parents pretty much said I wasn't mentally stable for education so they won't fund me which makes sense cause I tried going back to college  Just failed miserably,I started having memory issues ? Idk never got answer for why it happened tho? Doctor said it was related to anxiety and depression.  My memory kept slipping it's was like ganjani but mild  I couldn't remember my home address or phone number  Sometimes I forget my hostel KO road from college and end up roaming street for hours   It happened so often I had to use Google maps for everything,even going from college to hostel I had to use google map on standby,so i won't get lost for like 8 months or so then I somehow memorized the street . Ya so I wasn't really cut to be in college anymore .  After that I did some IT WORK IN CIVIL AVIATION IN BHAKTAPUR through friend connection 15k KO job fought with employes and left the job then became a waiter in cafe left that too currently I am studying Korean in hope for employment and pay back medical loan at least.  Mom health has been declining  ,she got lukemia idk early stage or something I am too scared to ask her ,she tried telling me about it but I kept zoning out cause of anxiety   ,my best friend of 8 years got diagnosed with some mf connective tissue disorder or something .she has lost her sight from birth and now she is loosing her hearing and ability to walk ,she constantly bring up she would end her life soon . Saying there is nothing left to live if I am blind,deaf and physically disabled.  And I am looser who writes  ()Day no politicians or security forces got arrested for September 8 killing.  As if me writing this would do anything . I don't need sympathy or money  .I am just removing load from my heart and head . I am a failure as a son  Am the reason why my family is in this condition and I am trying to change it . I wish I was never born.",

Ani hami saab jana yehi loop ko part hau. We're sooo in this loop ki, we never think for a second to question is this even a right thing for me? Are having kids a part of MY plans that I want in MY life? Most of my male friends get shocked when they say I do not want kids, then they ask me follow up questions like, \" You don't want kids now? I understand.\" But when I tell them I don't want kids ever, they always assume that it's a phase. Personally for me, I haven never wanted kids, I like other people's kids sure, but my own I don't know.    There's a lot of things to consider, first is being a good involved parent. In today's world, where kids will know about a billion things before they even turn 5, how would I even parent them? The world has flipped on it's head between the time when I was a kid and when I will have kids. Just keeping them fed, sending them to school and and maybe playing with them for 30 minutes after work wouldn't be good parenting, I'd rather get a pet.    Second, every time I have talked to an older person, our parents' age and even my own parents, they always have this wishful thinking \"Mailey belaima bachha paunu satta mero career ma focus gareko bahye ma ka pugisakthye\", or \"bachha bhaera mailey kaam chodnu paryo\", or \"bachha paepachhi I had to work extra to support my family\" so people always have this feeling of slight resentment on their kids for a life that could have been  and I DO NOT EVER WANT TO HAVE THIS ON ANY CHILD because they did not ask to be born and you just had a kid and treated them like an accessory.   Also the economy is fucked. In this day and age it feels like a compulsion in a middle class household for both partners to work. So who will do the childcare? I assume most girls wouldn't want to live with their inlaws anymore. So the burden of raising your kids falls on both parents and if one income is to be cut short the cost of living would swallow us all.    Tara yo sabai mero afnu soch ho, mero lagi a childfree life seems doable, ani I also think not having kids isn't selfish, it is the most selfless act a person can do. Afu ramro parent banna sakchu sakdina tha nabhai samaj ko loop ma ghusera bachha paidinu is more selfish IMO.|||🙌🙌🙌🙌   gf nai bacha jasari take care garnu parcha. I dont think i can handle another.

MAke sure you out in the effort.   2. Learn a skill that is different from what you are trying to do. I would suggest get into content creation/video editing or designing. you will need this skills if you are a doctor or a business owner.      B) if you are having 2nd thought about CEE then:  1. We (cerulearn) have a counselor who can match you with your career.   2. Learn a skill that is different from what you are trying to do.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??

Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area.

Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election.

Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

Interestingly, he had a brand-new iPhone 17 Pro Max and he looked like someone who could easily afford the treatment. And remember, this is a government hospital, where the treatment cost is already minimal. It really makes me think why do people become so money-conscious when it comes to health? People will happily spend over a lakh on the latest phone, or thousands on dinners and movies. But when it comes to a doctor's fee of Rs. 1000 or a life-changing surgery, it's suddenly \"too much.\" My main thought wasn't even about the doctor's fee (though we do train for 10-15 years). It was about fairness. The subsidized system is a lifeline for people who genuinely have nothing. When someone who can comfortably afford to pay uses those limited resources, they might be taking that spot from someone who truly can't. Am I seeing this the wrong way?

They wanted corruption to end. They wanted their country to progress.   So I am not going to vote because it will benefit my life, but because those kids dreamt of something.",

Until and unless, government shifts the source of its revenue to something else, we have to carry the burden.  The government have to penetrate the production market itself and compete with the general corporations and earn the revenue.  Another source of income can be charging less tax to foreign nationals  who fulfill the residential critera but for this to happen Nepal should be one of target destinations for Nomads experts. Minimal revenue but still something.  Simply reducing the tax burden will lead to less revenue in government funds.

            "body": "So yesterday CEE results came, congrats to whoever succeeded. I'm a med student myself and have seen a lot and lot of students who regret joining medicine. There are passionate guys, i know. The road looks greener on the other side, be it during CEE or during MBBS. The only thing that keeps most med students going in Nepal is the fact that you can earn a shitton load of money abroad. But that too, requires a lot of investment and efforts. I've seen a lot of students studying in paying who are doing academically good, but regret joining MBBS. I've seen scholars failing every internal exams too. I'm active on the indianmedschool subreddit and that's a different depressing tale of there.   If you want to study in paying and your yearly household savings is not more than 8L, DON'T. If you want to study in scholarship and you got your name enlisted, go for it. But it you want to drop a year just to be in this rat-race again, I would not suggest you to. Find passion in something, but medicine is not the place if you can't see yourself being anything other than a doctor. It is said easier than done, but medicine is definitely hard. That's why medics are respected everywhere (except india and nepal ofcourse).  Anyways, I wanted to share that doctors study 5.5 years, like no other course within medicine. There used to be a time when intern doctors were looked up to. But now, due to the fact that everyone has spread the wisdom that intern doctors have no hands-on experience, everyone looks down upon them. Even the nurses and pharmacists. Not trying to demean any course, but the volume others read in 2 years is presented to MBBS students to memorise within 1 year (judging by the volume).   Being from a well-to do family, I was always presented to anyone new as a \"future doc\". So, it never came to my mind that I could do anything other than medicine. Medicine itself is not bad. But the fact that there is no value in Nepal even after completing your MBBS has started to hit me too. There are 2 category of people I see around me. One who enjoy life, dont study much, search for shortcuts to pass the exams as if they joined medicine just to pass exams. Others who study well, are depressed, have not much social life and regret joining this course. Had I gone abroad, I wouldn't have had to anticipate my parents' money each month just for survival, I would've been able to send some cash home and uplift our overall standard. That thing haunts me, and I think it will be so till I get into MD or residency. But the fact that you can earn six figures is what is keeping me sane. I deeply love medicine, the fact that whatever I'm studying is somebody's life, each case I observe today, I might get to encounter it someday is what keeps me motivated. But I don't thing I can last long just like how my friends threw away standard textbooks to rot memorize fasttrack. I'm scared I might do it too, the question is: How long can I last?",

Slowly, most of the jobs in the sector of management and engineering will be taken over by AI agents. Healthcare related professions are the last one to be affected. So, think of that and do your best and study to be a great doctor!|||drop lini vanyeko dai ko post le blank bhanayo|||I am a Doctor . So for me the reaction is mixed.   If you are creative, are rich plus you are really smart, Dont join medicine.  It is not the best strategy for the earn big life. Its for a stable, middle class to upper middle class life.  I see people joining medicine for that reason. No. If you are the right person, a businessman , IT person >>> Doctor. Thats why I am studying both as well in the side despite being a Doctor.   ----- But being a Doctor has this high ceiling. If You become an HA, or a nurse or a pharmacist. No high celing. When you take the MBBS route, the sky is the limit. There are many oppurtunities, many line of work you can get into, easy to travel and relocate etc.   --- Is the whole field of MBBS in Nepal doomed? No.  Its a battle.  Some people , ho they are victims. Medicine victimizes many. Residency can be toxic. Many do suicide attempts and so on. Auta battle ma k huncha? Does everyone die? Afai bujnus.  There is the other side as well. Not many get to experience it. But its also a case of luck, how well connected you are, how smart you are, not just book smart. Also getting a job is not that hard compared to others. From the start, you have this sense of being respected, earning decent (its just the start). The idea is you earn big as your experience and avlue increases.  When people dream of MBBS , this part is what they are dreaming of. But what they dont realize is its a battle. Afu victimize vayera a life long addictions dekhi self harm  dekhi liyera testo ma pani gaincha. Many do. Reality. But many also come alive, fit and fine.   But objective measures ma herni vaye, if you want a an upper middle class life style, stable, always needed, sense of meaning and purpose,  not just money, a chance to be a leader for patients, juniors, nurses, Doctor is okay. You are kinda the apex of healthcare.   But if you want to earn big -- Business, IT, Finance. But only if you are very very smart.  Dont know about other professions, but I know each has their own good and bad sides. You choose based on your own goals and needs.|||As another medstudent my suggestion is just don't listen to medinfluencers for your career. And don't get into it for money. Yes you will earn decent money but almost 6 to 7 years after you start you will see your friends who took a different route earn, enjoy their youth while you're still just maybe a little bit more then halfway across your journey .You will rot away in a room with Davidson and Bailey and it will be stressful. So take it only if you can see yourself through gritty stress during exams and almost spending 2 to 3 hrs everyday dedicated to your studies. It's not all sad though its chaotic fun as fuck too so weigh your pros and cons don't listen to others advice just think if you are ready to give up 6 to 7 years purely to studies. Now most med aspirants think that they will go abroad after their finals but let me give you a fair bit of warning and that is its the hardest course you can choose to go abroad you will not only be competing with Nepalese for USMLE or AMC or PLAB it will be best of the best across the globe . And on top of that just your intellect won't be helping you, going abroad is costly as fuck and it will be around 3 4 more years before you start getting paid. So think while everyone else is settling down after they enjoyed their youth you will still be a burden on your parents for about the next decade. So choose this course wisely and my only advice is you can coarse through it yes its brutal but its doable but only choose it for the service you will be providing to serve people around you if you just choose it for money then perhaps it would be dumb as there are many options where you earn more and early. This career here you won't vet to enjoy vacations , birthdays long holidays as much as other careers . And to end everyone doing whatever be it MBBS or anything else after results will make it in life so chin up everyone.|||Like MBBS padadai you can actually tutor Cee aspirant lots of money making oppuetunity, My own cousin is in 2nd year in this Dashain he earned so much!

Talking about social skills u need to improve slowly that takes time. But the same thing have a blind faith that u will eventually grow and be that person u want to be.

I don’t know what went wrong since I was always a good student with above average grades.    But, despite all of this, I haven’t given up.

The best thing you can do is to have a positive attitude and get out of your comfort zone. Don’t give a shit about what others might say. If you feel like everyone is judging you and your actions, say to yourself, “who do I think I am that everyone has their eyes on me?” Everyone has their own problems and nobody has time to judge others.    Only you can help yourself. The world will not end if you have few awkward moments.   HELP YOURSELF. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.|||Well... You see, to think about talking, is living in the future? That causes anxiety. If you say you don't know how to speak to people what is it you are thinking about when you imagine talking to someone. I spent 10 years in therapy, still need it sometimes, I took medication for another 10 years. And truthfully my life changed, BUT, and this is the most important thing about it; therapy and meds didn't make me talk or overcome my anxiety, actually doing it made the change and it eventually became permanent.   Think of it as learning to walk, you may not remember but there was a time when you tried to walk and fell and decided to stop trying. But fear hadn't taken hold of you yet. So you tried again. And did better but still failed but you kept trying. I guess today you are walking just fine.  I started talking to elderly people, they want to be heard and to hear people, take the time to chat with them. Ask for advice, they've lived so much without the cures of our times and overcame them.  It is also true that I've accepted the fact that I don't really like talking a lot, even if sometimes I have a lot to say, and finding that definition of yourself helps a lot, you don't have to be as talkative as anyone else, or as extroverted as anybody. You have to be you, and if you don't want to talk it's ok, but if you need to do it, free yourself from the shackles of fear, one step at a time, one word at a time, one chat at a time. Do not expect the outcome, be surprised when one day you'll find yourself remembering a time when you couldn't even think of talking outspokenly.   As for the existing. My friend, life is about experiencing existence. What I'm saying is, it's not about you deciding on your existence, but in experiencing everything this existence has to offer, the good, the bad, the wonderful, the sad. Change your focus, from you, to the world around you.  I know all this is easier said than done. I know you've heard all or some of this before. But with the passing years, I've started to understand, it's like chips falling into place, the same advice I heard in my youth and couldn't grasp it, now resonates strongly in my mind. Seek knowledge, about you and the world around you and the pieces will start filling the emptiness of doubt, and, as the elder so often say, eventually you'll understand.   Chat me up if you wanna talk sometime, I can't promise to answer quickly but I'll definitely answer. Besides writing is easier than talking, right?|||Have u tried reading some self-help books?

I used to have issues with self harm, alcohol abuse and self hatred. I used to do self harm everyday but it's been over 3 years and I don't have these issues anymore.   One thing to say though: trauma never truly leaves you, you find better ways to cope but getting rid of core trauma requires upwards of 12 years of therapy and it's even worse for people with complex PTSD.   The first thing you should do is realise you need help and you need to treat yourself like your own mentor. You are your own best friend and your own personal trainer. Whenever you have thoughts like \"I'm worthless\", \"noone will care if I die\", you need to challenge these points like a best friend. Remember: NOONE and I mean NOONE is worthless because worth is a human made term. It doesn't mean anything since it's defined by outside influence.    For example: 500 rupees is worth more than 50 but there is no law in the universe that says this, we humans made up these terms because they made sense in a market driven society. Other than that, self worth (how you view yourself in relation to others) is something you yourself have to be able to set. I'm not asking you to say you're worth as much as gold over night but the goal is to slowly start to question and argue with your inner thoughts.   Take it slow, this shit takes YEARS. One day at a time. Force yourself to do something, anything. Being in nature is especially good to start. Once you feel more comfortable going outside, set further goals: maybe go on a trek. This style of training is something you can do for ALL your fears.   I conquered social anxiety for example by forcing myself to speak up. I remember at my uni, my legs were shaking and my voice was stuck in my throat on every sentence and my mind suddenly went \"you're doing it again. You're making a fool of yourself\".   Don't worry you can do it. We're all adults now, we're all people with busy lives, teenager bullies are likely not to exist anymore, they're out of that phase. You HAVE to understand that. Most people are kind, believe me and if they see you're really trying to communicate, they'll most likely appreciate it.   You're not alone, man. Even if the world doesn't give a shit if you exist or not, you dictate that. You have the ability to jump off a bridge or keep on living, nobody has any right to take away your life from you, you hold that entirely in your hands.   Any decision you make from tomorrow will have to be strategic: do something valuable to yourself and reward yourself. Say: you went outside for the first time in a week, so you treat yourself with your favourite food. You need to celebrate any small goals you achieve. Those small goals add up to a big one.   You get to dictate your own worth, my guy. That's the ONE thing you have control over even if EVERY other aspect of your life is against you. Even if you're at the bottom of the barrel, your worth never changes.|||You just need to tackle the embarrassment and cringe head on.

Ofc you don’t know how to make friends, nobody does. But we can learn right? And making friends and conversations is a two way street. Be genuine with it. People are more likely to open up if you are open yourself AND DON’T mind those hurt souls who are stuck in their own self made bullshit world and is negative all around.   “Beggars cannot be choosers.”, I used to think to myself. This is not a negative self-talk though, mind that, its just a perspective, go and put yourself out there, take the fall, eat them rejection, you’ll learn much, embrace it for one day you might realise that is what you have missed out on such in life.|||Try meditation, and look into spirituality a little bit as well. Also if you take marijuana, try to quit it. Apparently makes anxiety much worse. See if you can find a hobby you can enjoy. Meditation and psychedelics helped me a lot. Of course you can not cure it with medication, but you can make it manageable.|||watch spiderman or bunch of superhero movies, watch shwetabh gangwar (if u understand hindi)|||Talk to somebody, reach out to somebody even if you can think of one person, like you let it out here, it gives u relief, start with one or two people, you dont have to make a lot of friends.

Some products are really discounted by 2-3k, got to give credit for that. Yesterday was November 10, 2025, the day when Daraz promised rs.  11, rs.111, rs.1,111 or rs. 11,111 for limited number of products. They advertised as \"fast finger game\", where customers are supposed to put the said products in the cart and wait for the clock to hit exactly 8pm, then the said product's cost would drop to \"11-xxx\". I too was already looking to buy a tablet, Redmi Pad 2, which also was in the \"fast finger\" list.

When the clock hit 8pm, I constantly refreshed varieties of those \"fast finger\" products, only to see them \"in stock\" and again \"out of stock\".  Here's what I think Daraz is doing: no one actually gets to buy a rs.1,000 product for rs.11, let alone a 25k tablet for 1k. Daraz creates high traffic by announcing such events and presents false transaction for hype. How can a product go out of stock even before 8pm, the time when they said would go on sale? Because in reality, people would be waiting for the super deal eagerly, wouldn't they? I only saw once a 30k product priced as 1,111rs., but when I tried to enter, their system said \"opps, error\" or something like that. Then the next minute it got in, but \"out of stock\". With every refresh, the \"out of stock\" changed from \"2 remaining\" to \"5 remaining\" and then again \"out of stock\", then again didn't show any quantity number(s) which meant fully restocked in seconds.  Daraz is only hurting it's image doing these fake \"MeGa\" sales. If only Daraz actually gave significant percentage discounts (20-50% real discount) for few days, their sales would sky rocket for real.  The only upside of this \"MeGa SaLes\" is Voucher Discounts. You can get 1.7k to 11k voucher discounts (at least yesterday those were real and available). Besides the voucher availability, Daraz 11.11 is nothing but a dishonest scheme!",

It is engagement bait. They want to instill into people's memory that something exists by using the 1 Rs gimmick. I'm sure there were hundreds who clicked buy on that Rs 1 item but got cancelled on the payment page. They are just playing on people's hope.  And have you seen the Rs 1 page. There are so many items. They can't possibly give one free item every 8 pm and 3 pm daily for 10 fucking days. They probably have like 5-10 items at one 8 pm slot. I think this is why it got out of stock at 7:56 because they are disabling items which are not supposed to go live at Rs 1 at that slot.  This is why lottery is so popular. You cannot do lottery in Nepal with money so these companies make shitty lottery adjacent promotions. The idea is to hook people in.  But the 11% off deal is real and it is really significant if you are buying phones. Because even the dealers with physical stores don't get more than 4% of the markup.  12-12 ni aaucha.

I went to the store and those guys were selling it for 15000 (in Big digital store, Kumaripati) without shipping fees and after showing them their daraz prices they agreed for 12300 without shipping fees but they same time selling like 13000 in Daraz.  I think the story is same for every other seller like in-store prices are hell expensive if you ask me and then on 11.11 Deal I was able to get 3k more cheaper.

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.

If you invest or just like checking NEPSE, I’d love your feedback:  👉 [**https://fynex.dev**](https://fynex.dev)  It’s my first serious full-stack build, not a dev by trade, just someone who loves making useful things.

I love your work! Kudos to you!!|||Do people want this? I'm not sure maybe they do maybe they dont, I love the UI of the website, but what do you offer more than existing sites other than cleaner UI? I like that you have SIP investment and Commodity like Gold/Silver, but if this is your edge over others then  you need to realise your uniqueness or your \"edge\" can be easily replicated.  I think your product would be more valuable if you can do some kind of analysis on the market itself but then that is a difficult thing because there are again a lot of websites that do basic analysis like nepsealpha. For basic portfolio summary there is a widget called \"Advanced Widgets for MeroShare\"  which gives you all those numbers like P/L%, daily P/L, overall P/L and the good thing is you dont need to pay anything or upload the data anywhere, it's integrated into the browser.  If this is done as a hobby project to show case your FE skills, well then it's a good one, but if this is done with the intention that people may use it, well then, ermm im not sure there's anything special for people to upload their data into your website.  If you want people to use this, maybe also incorporate some kind of advanced market analysis, and make sure it's thoroughly tested! Research about the market gap, atleast make sure you offer more than what nepsealpha does.|||damn eti saaro vibe code hanna milxa aile  daami xa bro|||> not a dev by trade  Hits different. Same boat.

On Reddit alone, there are tons of posts every day from folks offering web dev services or showing off their projects.  It makes sense, web development seems approachable at first. You pick up some HTML, CSS, and maybe some framework , and you can already build something that looks good. But once you dig a little deeper, things start getting complicated fast. Real web development isn’t just about putting pages together; it’s about understanding APIs, scalability, system design, security, and how all the moving parts connect behind the scenes.  A lot of beginners stop at that surface level and call themselves “web developers,” but frameworks can only take you so far. The real value comes from knowing what’s happening under the hood, that’s what separates someone who just builds websites from someone who builds reliable, scalable systems.  And honestly, it’s worth going even further. Explore backend engineering, cloud computing, DevOps, automation, or data systems. Those areas don’t just make you a better developer , they help you understand how the whole ecosystem works, beyond just how to make something look good on the screen.",

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

Some lack knowledge, others just don’t care about patient. Most MBBS graduates can’t even get license in first try. There’s also little consequence for doctor mistake because of doctor shortage in Nepal and all doctors protesting if anyone is prosecuted. Even doctors I know suggest to go to India or other country for any serious health issue. |||>After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly.

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%. After two years of fear, stress, and uncertainty, my wife is finally healthy. Biggest lessons: don’t rush medical decisions, always get multiple opinions, trust your instincts, ask questions, and stay hopeful.

Vauju lai mero tarfa bata 1kg anar dinu hai|||If you have money, don't ever do anything serious medical stuff in Nepal. What happened to OP is unfortunately common. My aunt had a similar experience where the doc said immediate surgery but her family decided to wait and instead went straight to Thailand. The doc over there said that it WASN'T even serious. Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again.

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||nepal k*anda in big 2025? f no.|||this sub is being used to train horniest nepali ai|||Don’t go to those sites or stop watching these kind of shit bro.

Attention within the Nepali Congress–CPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner.  >With Congress obtaining the governor’s post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor.  >In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner.  >Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant. The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.|||Jaba parxa rati taba budi tati|||hell nahhhhh.  was thinking of making it at lalitpur office.

Equality means giving both genders the same rights, responsibilities, and opportunities, not extra privileges. A separate seat for women might have been created for safety and comfort when society was not safe for them, but if we are moving toward real equality, then continuing this only shows that women still need protection instead of being seen as capable and strong. True equality should mean creating a society where everyone feels safe and respected without needing special seats or treatment.|||Equality vanera male Lai chai khoi ta equality?K mahila seat matrai hunu paryo aba yr (pregnant,old age,periods) lady Lai as a basic manners le jasley ni help garnu parxa but male Lai chai gaaro hunna ra ??Ik female Lai ni garo hunxa but male Lai chai hunna ani ?Correct me if I am wrong always ready to learn...",

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6. Only a handful number of teachers teaches the best while others simply recite what is shown on the slides.|||Chem is all about consistency daily class na oadhako concept bujni ho ani al din aagadi mop up garera ni sakkincha|||Ma ta cheat chorera pass vako ho yaar :)|||Well 11 is not like 10, you have to study, hunatw ma ni ekdin agadi padera +2 katako ho, but chemistry ko lagi chai you need to revise reaction haru.

MAA KASSAM YESAI MA BIGRINE HO!  tried and tested, got like 68 in chemistry first term|||bro same chem ruined my streak too. what helped me was making reaction charts by topic and revising them daily for 10 mins. patterns started clicking after a while, especially when i wrote them not just read.|||same mann also i got hit by karma didnt study shi and now im gonna choke in re exams cuz i dont understand anything|||I think and I felt as well that chemistry is kinda easy if you know how the chemical reactions work rather than just memorizing it. Focus on breaking compound molecules and try to react with another compound like naturally. You will be able to do every reactions|||school level shit is still easy. You just gotta study consistently|||Go to a shop and buy a lot of sticky notes. Write a reaction on one side and and information on other aide.

MAke sure you out in the effort.   2. Learn a skill that is different from what you are trying to do. I would suggest get into content creation/video editing or designing. you will need this skills if you are a doctor or a business owner.      B) if you are having 2nd thought about CEE then:  1. We (cerulearn) have a counselor who can match you with your career.   2. Learn a skill that is different from what you are trying to do.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).  Model, color, distinguishing marks, last known location/time.|||you can message me with all the information you have about this person and the incident ,I am not saying I will succeed but I can try help you|||Apple ko authorized reseller bata purchase gareko bhaye, ra original purchase bill bhaye apple support lai report garda kei garna sakxan hola|||..........|||....|||........|||Why did you post this just now if it happened 2 weeks ago?|||so sorry but he looks like mero school ko classmate 😭|||Thanks guys for the help.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority.

No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||Bhik me kuch dedo humko bhaisahab|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

            "body": "A husband and wife posted a joyful TikTok video celebrating their new Australian citizenship. Soon after, Nepali users flooded the comment section with harsh criticism.  Some accused them of abandoning Nepal, saying things like “They should be banned from entering Nepal” or “Their Nepali citizenship must be immediately revoked.” Others even called them traitors and insulted the Nepali government for allowing it.  But in a surprising twist, it was later revealed that the couple weren’t Nepali at all—they were from Sri Lanka and had never even been to Nepal.  When the truth came out, both the Sri Lankan couple and the Nepali commenters were left shocked.  This incident, sparked merely by assumptions based on their Nepali looking faces, became a reflection of how quickly and blindly many react online without knowing the full story.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).  Model, color, distinguishing marks, last known location/time.|||you can message me with all the information you have about this person and the incident ,I am not saying I will succeed but I can try help you|||Apple ko authorized reseller bata purchase gareko bhaye, ra original purchase bill bhaye apple support lai report garda kei garna sakxan hola|||..........|||....|||........|||Why did you post this just now if it happened 2 weeks ago?|||so sorry but he looks like mero school ko classmate 😭|||Thanks guys for the help.

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

I did good in interview and got offer for 3 month internship with good stipend.  Note: I also rejected 3/4 unpaid offers",

Moved from MERN stack to NextJs.   Totally not confident in my skills, with little to no projects to show. I've been looking for an internship but I am aware that my skills are really lacking for the current job market.   And I have nothing to show case as my portfolio. So even though I got a refer in a company I keep delaying it.   I honestly feel pathetic for this.   But I currently am focusing on doing about 2 decent projects and applying for internship.   Can we connect here anonymously for now?   I honestly need a mentor, not someone who will teach me how to code but instead show me what I should do.   To Show me the way forward.   I am not asking a full on professional guidance but just Yknow pointing at a road to me. Even that would mean a world to be man.   Thanks a bunch!

Should i start learning web dev (I have not explored JS much I just know the basics ) or continue with AI/ML and maybe something with python?   Please be specific with your answer as I desperately want to earn and not just earn but make a solid career out of it. And any other experienced devs can help me out as well.  With all the tech stacks/  tech fields and the job requirements I am a little overwhelmed.

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||“People believe anything when it’s put between quotation marks.”   — *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2. With a population of 1.4 Billion - India has the market  for growth not just for tech companies but any international company looking to increase their revenues (CAGR and what not). 3. Microsoft's subscription model doesn't really suit the South Asian population.  But having said all this, Bill probably said it as a joke (if he indeed said it). I think his sense of humor is quiet terrible.|||kinda but rlly sab service based company matra ho and they have dherai population so ofc they r going to be better|||No there won’t b another anything in india.

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.   Since my brother studies in India, he managed to get me an 4/4gb - total of 8GB RAM for a much cheaper price, around 249 INR.

I earn in lakhs even with just a few years of experience, which I’m grateful for, but I can’t help wondering how long this will last.  Sure, I could aim for higher-paying roles or even start my own company, but honestly, that feels too risky right now. The market doesn’t seem very promising, and the uncertainty makes it hard to plan for the future.  At the same time, I know this routine: waking up early, going to work every day, coming home late, getting two days off won’t stay exciting forever. Sometimes I feel like I’m just running on autopilot.  Part of me envies people with government jobs. The pay might be lower, but there’s stability, no pressure to constantly learn new tech, and no fear of layoffs. Just a simple, secure, and peaceful life.  Does anyone else feel the same way?

Everyone was told not to mix, so families did the matchmaking. Also, Nepal actually has more women than men, so statistically it’s not a supply issue, even without arranged marriages, people will still get married because, well, people are gonna to get married.|||Our society is weird on relationships and all. I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense. Idiots.|||fuck this shit and everyone who post & include their kids in photo and videos and make them do trend and shit for social media reach & clicks. #keepChildrenAwayFromSocialMedia|||Xee lip maa kiss tah atti vayenah rah jati nai bachha ko maya lagay ni|||[deleted]|||Views ko lagi k k garxan hau 😭 he is Just a kid  Isn't she supposed to teach good and bad to that kid|||here is her [profile](https://www.tiktok.com/@samishres345?_r=1&_t=ZS-91DbiR5twtW)|||Ok but why the lips chuppa to a student?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan. Why Don’t we point it out?|||Hamro Nepal ko superstar vanaudo cha ni euta pakhey..  tyo jastai good night matra vanna gaako maanche lai k k vanira hau guys|||a simple question to everyone who's out there saying \"power ra paisa ko bhar ma judiciary le decision dinxa\". if so, why did he not buy the district court in the first place , why high court? why the victim didn't go to supreme court?

We told her that we were Nepali citizen and didn’t needed visa. Then ahead rudely shouted to get the bording pass from the person who made that rule. Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out. Thr lady couldnhave just asked her senior and would have know the reason but instead decided that she isn’t there to serve but to rule. The problem ia that these people aren’t deceplined for their actions and continue to melign the name of their own country.|||As an Indian, I'm very sorry that Nepalis have to go through this in India. I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating. I really want those officials punished for misusing their authority and especially because their actions have cost someone an important career opportunity. It's making me angrier that there's no reason being cited. Can we lodge a complaint somewhere OP?|||Never transit in India. We tend to do it sometimes as fares are little less through that route. I would never recommend anyone to transit via Delhi. I have heard countless horror stories.|||My teacher told us incident of trip on Bahairahaw he wandered off to India's border, on duty guard took him to officer who then was trying to scoff him off so he just pretended to not speak Hindi, only answered when asked in English, he told Indian had internalized racism experienced in conolized years, the ones who speaks are seen as superior.  That was totally anecdotal but I have seen many Nepali trying to speak in Hindi when they meet an Indian person but the enthusiasm is never recipocated.|||Mad coz balaen said fuck india that day|||I had faced the same issue in Delhi airport.|||I never had any issues|||raape capital of the world bata saglo farkeko ma badhai miss  but who tf with sane mind flies thru sheethole indian airport, duniya ko most racist,sexist, xenophobic manche haru ko circus ho tyo|||Remember the time they used to label Russian Women as Rs. 6000. Yes, there is a reason the world hates them.  India is a cancer to South Asia and to the world of course. Very few indians are good.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge! Maybe the reason is recent protest and many criminals were out of jail. But The hotel manager knew that they weren't bad people, but didn't allow them.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands.

Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone. But I am ok now. Ek barsa drop liye and gave entrance exams again, BHOLI results aaudai chha and I feel positive about the results.  I honestly believe 11 ko results le kei matter gardaina. Ramrari padeu bhane mazza le ramro gpa lyauna sakinchha. Here's a quick tip for you...  1.Sab teacher ko chhutai chuttai notes banau and make sure to store them safetly.  2. Class ma lekhako sab fata fat chhapa, kei chutyo bhane leave some space tara chhapna chhodne hoina.  3. Don't wait for the teacher. PW ko lectures herera teacher le chapter suru garna aagadi nai timi finish gardeu (PW ko notes pani ramrari banau )   4. Napadhne keta haru sanga aali kam sangat rakha, also if you're talking to a girl ( romantically) make sure it doesn't take a lot of your time and energy.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail. I being a metro scholar failed real bad my terminals. It shook all the confidence within me, had me go through lots of bad mouthing from my own parents. So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track.

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted. TLDR: rpeating years, doesn't equal to same amount of preparations every year. Some years are good, some are not.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I thought I’d go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that… but now, I don’t even feel like staying in science. Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me — social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.
