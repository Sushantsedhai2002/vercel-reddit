Management seems to be in demand and congrats on your PR. I would that it depends on what's your financial and family situation is here in Nepal. I work in Bangalore, mostly remotely. I make around 30 Lakhs INR there \\[Fixed+Bonus\\] but i really want to migrate to a better place, not just for better salary but a better quality of life, not just for me but for my family.    In this day and age, i feel it's really hard to grow your wealth working in Nepal. Our currency decrepiates, inflation is really high. It gets more expensive every year and the gap between the salary vs the expenses are really going up. It's not like the old days when people with 50-60k salary used to buy land and build house. If you come from a financially well family, It might make sense for you to stay. It all depends on one's situation so i also says it would say it depends on you and your condition here in Nepal.   If you want to buy a house of your own or travel, i feel the salary in Nepal would be less. I feel living cost is quite expensive in Kathmandu \\[other than just the rent, i mean groceries, eating out, travel - comparing it with Bangalore cost\\]. Also, as you say you are pretty ambitious guy, think of your ceiling in Nepal vs Australia. Another factor would be your friends & family, if you wanna stay close to your friends and Family, maybe nepal would be a better option, but if you wanna reach even higher levels, think of your future children and a better quality of life for them, you might be better moving to Australia. I would suggest to go out there, give it a shot, you could do much better there. If it doesn't work out, maybe you can come back to Nepal. But if Australia really works out, you might have a better life, not just you, your family as well.   Anyways, Good luck to you. Wish you the best on whatever decision you make.|||Embrace the journey, trust the process, go with the flow, explore while you can !!|||Bro chora chori ko bhabisya banaune ho vhane aus better nai vhane Nepal chai dheri nei thik xa ani yaa aayerw kamaune ni tei nei ho…..|||I’ve been in Australia since 2022. I’ve just finished my studies, and honestly, PR is on my mind 24/7.  Earning 2 lakhs a month in Nepal is a big deal no doubt, you’re doing well. But think long term. What if you end up in hospital for any reason? The cost of treatment and lifelong care can be massive.  With Australian PR, you get Medicare ,meaning you don’t have to pay a cent out of your pocket for most healthcare services. That alone is a game changer.  There are many other benefits of Australian PR, but if I were you, I’d book my ticket tomorrow and fly to Australia purely looking at the healthcare system here.  Congratulations on all fronts, and good luck, mate.|||If you think you can struggle for a bit and make it, move. With a good job in Australia, it will be worth it.

But again, life in Nepal is too chill. Tyoo chill sab harauxa tei ho dukha chai!|||Don’t take advice too seriously from people who’ve never stepped foot outside the country.   One important thing you really need to think about is your financial background in Nepal beyond just your monthly income. Whatever you earn there gets eaten up quickly by the high cost of living. If you have bigger ambitions...building your own house, buying property, driving a nice car, or genuinely accumulating wealth...ur job in Nepal is unlikely to get you there.  You’re still young enough to explore and start from scratch, and going on a PR visa rather than as a student definitely puts you in a better position. That said, it won’t be easy. Without a specific, in- demand skill, management role in Nepal won’t get you anywhere in Australia.  Still, you can give it a few years and test the water. That experience alone will tell you whether it’s for you or not. And even if it isn’t, it won’t be too late to try something else in life after that.  Edit- I have PR and everything and if I can get a job somewhere 3 lakh and upwards in Nepal, I will return back tomorrow. But it may be because I have already \"explored\" everything you wanted to.|||Every man for himself. If you care about being example, be ready to be dissatisfied with life.

            "body": "I want to share something that happened today. As we all know, pickpocketing is extremely common on public transportation. If you’re a regular public transport user, chances are you’ve witnessed it at least once. I’ve been using public buses for a long time, so I’ve seen this pattern many times.  Usually, these people come in groups. They act like they’re all friends, sit close to each other, talk loudly, and keep changing seats.  The same thing happened today. I was on a bus (Mayur Yatayat), when a group of four or five guys got on. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but you could immediately feel that something was off. They sat near each other, kept talking, and kept switching seats, one moment here, the next moment somewhere else. That alone raised red flags.  What made it very clear was what happened near the Tinkune area. A group of passengers, they were from Terai region, got on the bus. As soon as they entered, one of these guys said, “naya manche chadyo, manche chadyo.” Immediately, one of them stood up, and the group moved close to the new passengers as if they were trying to get past them.  One of the passengers then said he felt someone’s hand inside his jacket pocket, trying to take his phone. A confrontation happened. They couldn't speak clear Nepali but you could easily understand them saying that they were pickpocketers. Immediately after that the group got off bus, as if nothing happened, ultei attitude ka sath.  What was even more frustrating was that another passenger (who was at the last seat) came forward and told the driver and conductor that he had seen these same people many times on this same route. According to him, they usually get on at Gausala and get off around Koteshwor. He said the drivers, conductors, and even the police knows about them, but nothing is done.  This is something I’ve been witnessing since I was a kid. These groups often create distractions, sometimes even fake fights, to divert attention. I still remember an incident from around 12/13 years ago when a group acted like they were fighting, and during that moment, a woman shouted that someone tried to pull the ring off her finger.  What made today even more depressing was that The driver as well as the conductor knew about these people. The guys later confronted the conductor asking him questions like: what about safety of passengers? Why do you let them get on despite of knowing who they are? And the conductor just hussed them off.  Even cops knows all this. We only hear about arrests during their Dashain operations, natra barsa bhari matlab gardeina police le pani.  Some might say, “Why didn’t you confront them?” By the time it became clear, they were already leaving. One of them was drunk, they were all huge and kept cursing, were aggressive, were in group. Getting into a physical fight with them isn’t realistic or safe. Yes record chai garna sakinthyo, but tyo bela dimag chalena.  This problem is way too common, and yet nothing changes. So in the end, we have to be responsible for our own safety. Because as the other guy said, groups like these are regular and he can even recognise them at this point.  If you’re a regular public transport user in Kathmandu, please stay alert and be careful.",

            "body": "Hi everyone, I need some perspective. I’m in my early 20s and dealing with a stressful situation involving a family relative who lent money to my dad a while back. The details are complicated, but here’s the gist:  About a year ago, my dad took a loan of 5 lakh from a relative. I wasn’t involved in the borrowing — the money was transferred to my bank account for convenience. I later used it for US visa processes, repaying some old debts, and day-to-day expenses. To be clear, I had **no idea this was loan money**. My dad just told me I would receive the money. I only found out it was a loan **about three months later**.  Recently, the lender came to my house and started threatening me. He’s demanding I pay him directly, and even suggested I work somewhere and give him my salary until the debt is cleared. He also threatened police action.  There was one instance about nine months ago where my dad sent me 25k to pay him, but I ended up using it for my brother’s tuition instead. My brother hadn’t gone to school for almost three months, and the school was pressuring us because my dad rarely sent money. I decided to pay 40k, using 15k from my own savings. That’s the **only money I’ve personally “handled” for this**. I haven’t told my dad about it, and honestly, it wasn’t my responsibility — it was his job to pay my brother’s tuition.  The key thing is, there was **no agreement between me and the lender**. The loan was my dad’s responsibility. I did not sign anything, did not take the loan personally, and never promised repayment. From what I know, there may not even be a written agreement between my dad and this relative. Despite that, he’s pressuring me to give a **cheque**, which he could later use as evidence.  He even suggested that I bring my dad so he could get the cheque directly. That’s impossible — we live in our grandmother’s house, and my dad has been largely absent. The last time I saw him was four months ago. I dropped out of college because I couldn’t pay tuition. I currently work at Salesberry, earning 18k, but most of it goes to my brother’s school fees, groceries, and family needs. I’m also saving for a Japanese study visa and studying Japanese. Lately, I’ve been thinking about switching to a working visa and going abroad to earn for some time, but I really **want to study**. I would literally cry if I had to sacrifice my studies because of my dad’s bad financial decisions. All this time, I had been working hard, hoping I could go to Japan to study and eventually earn.  On top of all this, today he was **extremely abusive**, insulting me personally, mocking my achievements, and belittling my efforts. It was emotionally exhausting.  I had a small discussion with ChatGPT, and it advised me **not to write a cheque or any written document**. Can I safely follow this advice in the context of Nepal? I plan to start the documentation process for a Japanese student visa within the next few months, and I really don’t want a police case on my profile. I know he’s worried and I would pay him if I could, but we can hardly survive when I can’t even reach my dad.  Has anyone been in a situation like this? What would you do if a lender tried to pressure you directly like this, especially when the loan wasn’t yours?",

We expect that getting older means becoming wiser, but for most people, growing old doesn’t actually mean growing wise. Instead it feels like we collect more unnecessary baggage of habits, fears, expectations, and noise that bury whatever clarity we once had.  Life slowly starts to feel meaningless. We hold on to our relationships, our titles, our image in society, our routines, our ambitions, almost like we’re afraid that letting go would force us to face the silence and see who we really are underneath everything. We work all week, wait for the weekend, then fill that free time with more distractions. We say we want peace, but we can’t sit alone with ourselves. We feel this constant need to to stay busy, to communicate.  We can’t just sit and watch a sunset or feel the wind for its own sake. The innocent heart that we brought with us in this world is long gone and replaced with pretense. And it all feels… utterly stupid.   So what’s the reason? How can we live for so many years and fail to see the patterns we’re stuck in, or simply ignore even if we see it? Why do we accept this version of living without ever questioning it? Why don’t we ask ourselves the basic questions: Who are we really? What are we actually doing with our lives? Is this how a human being is meant to live? Are we becoming insensitive without noticing it?  I’m not saying there’s no point to life ... I’m just wondering why so many of us live without looking deeper.  **What are your thoughts on this?**",

I also have my license, so there is no legal reason to hold it back. I’m currently in Kathmandu and I desperately need it because I have to get to college early in the morning and then head to my internship afterward. Relying on public transport or Pathao every day is expensive and exhausting. ​It feels like they are just making excuses to keep the bike there, even though it’s mine.

When the government makes decisions that threaten their livelihoods, they organize and protest in ways that are impossible to ignore.  They bring tractors into cities, block roads, and use large-scale demonstrations to send a clear message: food producers matter. It’s not polite or subtle  it’s loud, visible, and effective. And because farming is so central to French culture, the public usually understands why they’re doing it.  What I find inspiring is that they don’t act powerless. They show that regular people, when united, can push back against powerful institutions and actually get results.  I wish more countries had that same level of courage and solidarity when it comes to standing up for workers and farmers. seeing my nation i feel why Nepalese farmer are not doing that",

            "body": "After waiting nearly three years for the Gwarko bridge to be built, it is deeply frustrating that commuters are still trapped in traffic for an hour or more, especially during peak hours. While vehicles glide smoothly on the bridge, the situation below routinely collapses into disorder and mismanagement. Watching this happen every few days, even after such a prolonged construction period, is frankly disheartening and unacceptable.  What makes this worse is the sheer waste of time — during school hours, office rush, and short, time-critical exams. When minutes matter, this junction becomes a serious liability.  The concerned traffic authorities should urgently review and rectify the traffic management below the bridge, because after years of waiting, the problem clearly remains unresolved.",

You just need good time management skills and a routine man. for eg: my routine most times (kept it flexible)  is: - wake up, drink enough water, freshen up - yoga mostly for 30 mins ( recommend downdog app, free and really really good) (if no time then stretch and dynamic warmups to wake my body) - shower  - prep lunch, do anything - start working around 11ish am - lunch break at 1-2 ( i don't have breakfast , just prefer coffee at least 1/1.5 hrs after i wake up and after drinking enough water) - work again until like 7/8 pm ( MNC so different time zone clients) [ i do sometimes have a low pressure afternoon , so I make sure to micro-learn multiple stuffs all day long) ( and obviously sometimes i waste those hours scrolling, I'm a human after all) - eat any fruit, go to gym 8-10  - dinner mostly 5 eggs omelette ,some left over rice fried and cucumber carrots etc etc salad. - 11-12 learn something ( Obv most days I don't have energy to anything anymore and just scroll and fall asleep, but i try to be aware about it and be conscious about my choices)   repeat T_T this repeats until i burn out and then every 2 months or so and go for a hike or just travelling. life feels monotonous inside my room all day long. so i make sure to go out on weekends, if i have to study on weekend then i go study outside. in libraries or cafes. anywhere.|||Stronger back = no back pain.

            "body": "Nepal's economic landscape has undergone a fundamental transformation over the past two decades, with remittances evolving from a supplementary income source to the primary pillar of national economic stability. Our comprehensive analysis, drawing from Nepal Rastra Bank's historical and current data, reveals critical insights into this dependency and its implications for Nepal's financial future.  # Macroeconomic Indicators: Then vs Now  # Historical Context (2004/05)  * **Total Remittance Inflows:** Rs. 65.4 billion * **GDP Contribution:** 12.3% * **Foreign Exchange Share:** 31.5% * **Official Channel Usage:** 20% * **Workers Approved for Foreign Employment:** 121,769 (2003/04)  # Current Scenario (2024/25)  * **Total Remittance Inflows:** Rs. 1,668.30 billion (≈$11.25 billion) * **GDP Contribution:** 33% (peak recorded in 2024) * **Year-over-Year Growth:** 12.7% (mid-June 2025) * **Official Channel Usage:** 67%+ * **Workers Approved for Foreign Employment:** 452,324 (FY 2024/25) * **Average Remittance per Worker:** Rs. 224,744 annually (vs. Rs. 16,227 in 1996)  # Structural Impact on Nepal's Economy  # Balance of Payments Dynamics  Remittances now constitute the largest component of Nepal's current account receipts, surpassing both merchandise exports and tourism receipts. In 2023, remittances contributed **26.6% to GDP**, exceeding the combined total of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).  **Foreign Exchange Composition (2024/25):**  * Remittances: 31.5% * Exports: 28.8% * Tourism/Travel: 5.0%  This structural shift has critical implications:  * Enhanced foreign exchange reserves * Reduced external sector vulnerability * Increased import capacity * Stabilization of Nepali Rupee vis-à-vis convertible currencies  # Labor Migration Trends  **Primary Destination Markets:**  1. Malaysia: 47% 2. Qatar: 30% 3. Saudi Arabia: 10% 4. UAE, Kuwait, South Korea: Remaining 13%  **Household-Level Penetration:**  * 1996: 10.8% of households received remittances * 2024: 35.6% of households receive remittances  In rural areas, remittances constitute approximately **80% of smallholder farm households' income**, while agricultural activities contribute only 20% a complete inversion of traditional income structures.  # Financial Infrastructure Development  # Banking Channel Optimization  Nepal Rastra Bank's regulatory initiatives have significantly improved formal channel adoption:  **Policy Measures Implemented:**  1. **Licensing Framework:** 31 private firms licensed for money transfer operations (as of March 2006) 2. **Incentive Structure:** 15 paisa per USD commission for licensed agents 3. **Foreign Currency Accounts:** Manpower agencies permitted to maintain forex accounts 4. **Bank Guarantee Facility:** Streamlined advance payment mechanisms for transfer operators 5. **Credit Guarantee Schemes:** Loan facilities for prospective migrant workers  **Results:**  * Official channel usage: 20% (2000/01) → 67% (2004/05) * Financial inclusion: 61% (2014) → 90% (2022) * Digital wallet adoption: 19 million users * Remittance transfer costs: 3.7% (approaching SDG target of 3%)  # Digital Payment Integration  The merger of Khalti and IME Pay in July 2025 created Nepal's largest digital wallet infrastructure, enabling:  * Instant remittance-to-wallet transfers * Real-time account deposits across 20 Class 'A' commercial banks * Integration with government payment systems * Enhanced transparency and reduced transaction costs  # Utilization Patterns: Microeconomic Perspective  # Fund Allocation (Nepal Rastra Bank Survey - 160 Households, 10 Districts)  **Primary Uses:**  1. Household consumption and daily expenses (highest allocation) 2. Real estate acquisition 3. Debt servicing 4. Jewelry and precious metals 5. Financial savings (bank deposits)  **Productive vs. Non-Productive Investment:**  The data reveals a concerning pattern: majority of remittance income flows toward consumption and non-productive assets rather than entrepreneurial ventures or business capital formation.  **Factors Contributing to Low Productive Investment:**  * Limited access to business development services * Inadequate entrepreneurship training for returning migrants * Higher perceived returns in real estate vs. business ventures * Risk aversion due to market instability and conflict * Insufficient microfinance penetration for small-scale enterprises  # Critical Challenges and Systemic Risks  # Economic Vulnerability  **Dependency Risk Assessment:** With 33% of GDP derived from remittances, Nepal faces significant vulnerability to:  1. **Destination Country Policy Changes:** Quota reductions, visa restrictions, deportations 2. **Global Economic Cycles:** Recession in GCC countries or Malaysia 3. **Permanent Settlement Trends:** Second-generation migrants may not maintain remittance flows 4. **Geopolitical Disruptions:** Conflicts affecting major labor markets (historical precedent: 1990-91 Gulf War)  # Dutch Disease Effects  Large-scale remittance inflows create potential for:  * Real exchange rate appreciation * Loss of export competitiveness * De-industrialization pressures * Real estate price inflation * Increased cost of living in remittance-dependent regions  # Agricultural Sector Decline  Labor migration has created acute agricultural labor shortages, resulting in:  * Fallow land expansion * Reduced agricultural productivity * Increased food import dependency * Rural community deskilling  # Human Capital Implications  **Brain Drain Metrics:**  * Skilled workers (IT professionals, healthcare workers, engineers) increasingly seeking permanent migration * Education-to-emigration pipeline strengthening * Knowledge transfer deficit * Innovation ecosystem constraints  # Policy Framework and Strategic Recommendations  # Immediate Priority Actions  **1. Financial Product Innovation**  * Develop remittance-linked investment bonds * Create migrant-specific mutual fund schemes * Design foreign currency denominated savings products with repatriation guarantees * Implement preferential loan rates for productive investments  **2. Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Development**  * Establish pre-departure entrepreneurship training programs * Create business incubation centers for returning migrants * Provide seed capital matching schemes (government + remittance funds) * Develop sector-specific investment opportunities (agriculture modernization, tourism, manufacturing)  **3. Regulatory Optimization**  * Maintain competitive interest rate policies * Ensure market-determined exchange rates * Reduce bureaucratic barriers for business registration * Streamline foreign exchange regulations * Enhance anti-money laundering frameworks without hindering legitimate flows  **4. Microfinance Expansion**  * Target remittance-receiving households for microcredit * Provide business advisory services alongside financial products * Develop cooperative models for pooled remittance investment * Create guarantee mechanisms for small business loans  # Long-Term Strategic Imperatives  **1. Economic Diversification**  * Reduce remittance dependency through domestic job creation * Develop export-oriented industries * Invest in technology and innovation sectors * Enhance tourism infrastructure and services  **2. Human Capital Retention**  * Create high-skill employment opportunities domestically * Develop competitive compensation structures * Invest in R&D and knowledge economy initiatives * Establish diaspora engagement programs for knowledge transfer  **3. Regional Economic Integration**  * Leverage Nepal's geographic position between India and China * Develop transit and logistics infrastructure * Create special economic zones * Enhance cross-border trade facilitation  # Comparative Analysis: International Best Practices  **Successful Models:**  * **Philippines:** Government-backed diaspora investment bonds * **Mexico:** Hometown associations pooling remittances for community infrastructure * **Egypt:** Own Exchange Import System (OEIS) linking remittances to import financing * **India:** Extensive banking network optimization and digital payment integration  **Lessons for Nepal:**  * Institutional coordination between ministries (Finance, Labor, Foreign Affairs) * Private sector partnership models * Technology-enabled transfer mechanisms * Transparent governance structures  # Data Transparency and Research Gaps  # Current Limitations  1. **Informal Channel Flows:** Estimated 33% through hundi and unofficial channels remain unrecorded 2. **End-Use Tracking:** Limited systematic data on remittance utilization patterns 3. **Regional Variations:** Insufficient district-level or province-level disaggregated analysis 4. **Return Migration Data:** Inadequate tracking of returning migrants and their economic reintegration  # Research Priorities  * Comprehensive household-level panel surveys * Impact evaluation of policy interventions * Cost-benefit analysis of formal vs. informal channels * Longitudinal studies on second-generation migrant behavior  # Conclusion: Strategic Imperatives for Nepal's Financial Future  Nepal stands at a critical juncture. Remittances have undeniably lifted millions out of poverty, stabilized the balance of payments, and provided crucial household income security. However, the current trajectory with one-third of GDP dependent on overseas employment—represents an unsustainable development model.  **The fundamental question is not whether remittances are beneficial, but rather: How can Nepal transform this temporary relief mechanism into a foundation for sustainable, diversified economic growth?**  **Three Scenarios for Nepal's Future:**  1. **Status Quo (High Risk):** Continue current patterns, remain vulnerable to external shocks, perpetuate agricultural decline 2. **Optimization (Medium Risk):** Improve formal channel efficiency, promote productive investments, maintain high remittance flows while gradually diversifying 3. **Transformation (Optimal):** Use remittances as transitional capital while aggressively developing domestic opportunities, reducing dependency over 15-20 years  The choice will determine whether remittances serve as a bridge to prosperity or a crutch that delays necessary structural reforms.  # Your Voice Matters: Join the Discussion  At **Bank Rate Nepal**, we believe informed financial decisions require open dialogue. We invite all stakeholders migrants, recipients, policymakers, financial institutions, and researchers to share perspectives:  **For Migrant Workers:**  * What financial products would help you invest remittances productively? * Would you consider returning if comparable opportunities existed in Nepal? * How do you balance current family support with long-term savings?  **For Remittance Recipients:**  * What prevents productive investment of remittance income? * What business support services would be most valuable? * How has remittance income changed your household's economic trajectory?  **For Financial Institutions:**  * What innovations could better serve the remittance market? * How can banks facilitate productive channeling of remittance funds? * What regulatory barriers hinder product development?  **For Policymakers:**  * Should remittances be partially directed toward sovereign development funds? * How can Nepal balance immediate poverty relief with long-term economic transformation? * What international partnerships could optimize remittance flows?  **Share your insights, challenge our analysis, and contribute to shaping Nepal's financial future.**",

It heavily emphasizes scary downsides, labeling remittances an \"unsustainable crutch\" that directly causes empty farms, higher living costs, export struggles (the Dutch Disease effect), and brain drain, creating a doom-and-gloom picture of migration flipping the economy upside down. Yet it barely acknowledges the massive benefits, such as sharply reducing poverty, building foreign reserves, stabilizing the rupee, and enabling family investments in education and health, which comes across as cherry-picked alarmism to push an urgent \"crisis, transform now\" narrative. At the same time, it pins nearly every economic problems on remittances without exploring other major factors like harsh weather impacting crops, unstable politics deterring investors, or poor infrastructure; while connections exist with migration, confusing \"happening together\" with \"directly caused by\" weakens the argument and makes the risks appear far more inevitable than they likely are.",

This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers. I really wanted to use the word ipso facto, fitting place and sentence nei bhetina.|||![gif](giphy|ZztgXZ5UhbKZTbPPSU)|||Would be better if second one wasn't there IMO|||Accept only female post if she got that curry cannon|||I dont like that flairs are now mandatory. When I used to post in r/Nepal, where flairs are mandatory, I was usually torn between which flair to choose as sometimes what you want to post does not fit into a specific category. For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard. My posts used to be deleted even after most of the community interacted well and didnt compain about the flair.

Honestly, it hurt to watch. I know things are not perfect. I know many of our protest demands still have not been met. But I also believe she is genuinely trying. She has said again and again that conducting elections is the most important task right now, and that part makes sense to me.  What really bothered me was the way people are reacting online. The comments are so harsh. People casually write things like “BUDI TA CHODD” without thinking that there is a human being on the other side of the screen. Criticism is fair, but this level of hate feels unnecessary. If she is forced to step down, I am almost certain parliament will be restored and we will be right back to Oli or Deuba as PM. The same old cycle again.  It already feels like the old parties are gaining momentum, and now people have started turning against this government too.   For me, it is simple.

            "body": "**Two 19-year-olds fighting fake news in Nepal - eating dalmoth to survive but refuse to give up. Here's our story.**  yaar sunna. this is our reality rightnow.  1.5 years ago, me and my friend Sangam were just normal college students scrolling social media. then one day we saw a video going viral - \"muslims attacking hindus during dashain in kathmandu\". thousands of shares. people getting angry. communities dividing.  we spent 3 hours that night researching. turns out? video was from bangladesh. 2 years old. completely fake caption.  but damage was already done.  that night we couldn't sleep. next day we posted our fact-check. some thanked us. many attacked us. but we thought - if we don't do this, who will?  thats how The RUJU started. two 19 year old guys with zero experience. just laptops and belief in truth.  **fast forward to now:**  we've been doing this for 1.5 years. no funding. working from home initially. families asking \"ke gardai xau laptop ma whole day?\"  few weeks ago we posted on linkedin - \"finding room in kathmandu is so hard.\" shared our struggle with brokers who scammed us. how we paid 500 registration fee and they ghosted.  response was INSANE. industry experts DMing. media house editor reaching out. young people wanting to join. we thought \"this is it. this is our breakthrough.\"  we found office space in shankhamul. small room but it was OURS. we were so motivated.  **then reality hit us like a truck.**  today? me and Sangam ate dalmoth and chiura for lunch. that's what we can afford. we're counting coins for next meal. rent? we don't know how to pay next month.  our website with AI fact-checking tool (RujuAI built on gemini)? almost ready. but who will see it?  followers? stuck. revenue? zero.  to survive, we're now building online store on side. haina imagine - fact-checkers doing ecommerce because bills don't care about your noble mission.  every morning: hope that today will be different every night: guilt about our future, fear about decisions we made  **but here's the thing:**  we see fake news everyday destroying lives. during elections - fake videos. during festivals - communal fake posts. during crisis - panic-inducing misinformation.  someone needs to fight this. so we still wake up. still verify. still post.  **and today we're launching something:**  RUJU FactCheck Community - on WhatsApp and Facebook.  why? because forwarded messages in family groups spread faster than our fact-checks on instagram.  the idea:  * anyone sees suspicious claim? share in community * we all verify together * truth comes out before panic spreads  this is youth-led initiative now. students building for everyone.  we're desperate. desperate for change. desperate for support. desperate to prove this matters.  we're not asking for money (although paisa bhaye ramro hunthyo lol). we're asking for participation.  join our community. share suspicious posts. help verify. spread truth.  **are we being foolish?** probably. **will this work?** don't know. **will we give up?** not today.  if you believe truth matters. if you're tired of fake news in your family groups. if you think two broke 19 year olds deserve a chance - join us.  sabai milera fight garau misinformation against.  yo hamro story ho. aba hajurko support chainxa.  are you in?  TL;DR: Two 19yo Nepali students started fact-checking initiative 1.5 years ago. Now eating dalmoth daily, can't pay rent, but launching community to fight fake news together. Need your support, not money - just participation.    links:    WhatsApp: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/F8lSTdCXK3M42XgUtTM7Yw](https://chat.whatsapp.com/F8lSTdCXK3M42XgUtTM7Yw)    TikTok: [https://www.tiktok.com/@ruju\\_factcheck](https://www.tiktok.com/@ruju_factcheck)  Facebook Page: [https://www.facebook.com/RUJUFactCheck](https://www.facebook.com/RUJUFactCheck)",

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction.

I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this.

I'd have LOVED to be in your place because I value respect, and give it unconditionally when unprovoked, and if, I'm not, it's scorching the ground they step on, with hot salt in their foreheads.|||You heard that song?   The winner takes it all etc etc|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ? Whoever the person is hero or villain if they are given special security, it means they are important. Maybe not important to you, but important to some people. If you are important enough that people might attack you, the government provides security , please ask for one .other wise there is nothing wrong in giving way, or at least trying to do so. Your stupidity can cause serious issues for others involved, and once again, our country could be blamed internationally.|||Don't take it negatively, providing security and priority is a social necessity, not a mere privilege they have won or deserve. We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.",

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

But, as far as I remember, the biggest “fish” he caught during his second tenure as Home Minister, which lasted about five months, was Kailash Sirohiya. Even that case fell apart, as Sirohiya was released after nine days due to a lack of evidence proving that his citizenship certificate was fake.

Today, a similar narrative is being built around Rabi Lamichhane, who is framed as the figure who will save the country from a corrupt, old political establishment, and the belief that this one leader will finally fix everything strongly resemble the enthusiasm once seen among UML supporters during Oli’s peak.

For the next few weeks, I’ll be out of town, and she isn’t comfortable using ride-hailing services like Pathao or inDrive. This made me think—why can’t these platforms introduce a feature where both the rider and the passenger are women? On top of that, the company could waive its commission for female drivers and passengers. Such a step would promote women empowerment, provide an added sense of safety for the women in our families, and also strengthen the company’s CSR initiatives. Taxis are an option, yes, but since we live in Budhanilkantha, using taxis regularly isn’t practical. It’s not really about affordability—I just feel the pricing is often unjustifiably high.

            "body": "Hi folks, just came to Nepal after 7 years and ride sharing apps like Pathao and InDrive seem to be making life a lot easier here these days. However, I am having a hard time in actually getting a ride through the app; and hoping if the community can suggest me ways on how to be an efficient user of the app.  So, I (M30s) created my account last week in Pathao. I have requested ride multiple times. The common trend seems to be that as soon as a driver (or a pilot) accepts the ride request, you call them to let them know exactly where you are.  However, for me, as soon as the pilot accepts the ride, they cancel the ride. This has happened multiple times. Meaning, I have not had a successful Patho ride during my 1-week of stay in Kathmandu so far. Whereas, my lady friend (F30s), gets the ride accepted all the times. Its comical that even when we are together, I request a ride just to get canceled by the driver. And we use her phone to request a ride, and voila the driver comes.  I would think its because I have a new account and no reviews and what not, but so does my lady friend (we created the account the same day).  So, if anyone knows of things or steps that I could be missing to make the Patho driver accept and actually show up for the ride, I would love to know. I do not want to jump to a conclusion, but are the drivers sexist in the sense that they only accept ride request fron females?  Also, for drivers: why even bother accepting if you want to cancel as soon as I get my hopes high?",

Pathao are very strict with misconducts and usually take immediate action to riders so there is likely less chances of them canceling the rides. They call you to cancel the ride if the pickup destination is far from them. If i remember correctly 3 cancels in a day leads to temporary ban in app.   Further download all 3 apps.  Pathao - most reliable with insurance coverage but prices are on higher side.   Yango - new app, cheaper rates, best if you want to use EV.   Indrive - unreliable amongst the three. Riders i have encountered are mostly unprofessional (my personal experience) and less accountable.   Check prices on all three app and request ride on app which seems to fit for your need.

            "comments": "I highly recommend getting a personal pathao|||Yango drivers prefer short trips because it helps them hit their target faster. After 6pm most have hit their target so they move on to pathao/in drive for better rates.   Pathao is for rich people who just want to get from a to b. If you're willing to pay the price it has the best service. They even call you and recompensate if your complaint is genuine in their eyes.   In drive is a cesspool of drama and betrayal where the company doesn't give 2 shits about either driver or passenger. You both have to guess dependent on the behavior of the other whether it's worth it.  The worst is Pokhara in drive. The driver will accept your offer and not move from their taxi rank. When you call them, they ask more than double. If you don't budge, they'll sometimes come pick you up but if they find someone else on the way to your pick up address, they'll ditch you. Even bikes have started doing it in Pokhara.  TLDR: cheap before 5pm yango, reliable but expensive pathao, chaos lovers indrive.

After that, my parents would collect the passport once it’s ready and courier it to me in India.  I wanted to ask:  Is third-party collection (parents) allowed after biometrics?  Did anyone here do something similar recently?  Do passport offices usually allow parents to collect with an authorization letter?  Any issues with couriering the passport to India?  This is quite urgent for me due to academics and future job documentation, so any recent experiences or advice would be really helpful. 🙏  Thank you in advance.",

Over the past few months, I’ve come to a difficult realization: I don’t enjoy studying or working in anything related to my academic field, and I don’t see myself doing this long-term. The thought of continuing down this path feels exhausting and honestly depressing.  On the other hand, I’ve discovered something that feels very different. I’ve started learning piano. I’m still a beginner, but I genuinely enjoy it in a way I’ve never felt about my studies. I can practice for hours without feeling tired, and I actually look forward to it. I feel confident that if I keep practicing seriously, I can become really good at it.  What scares me is the practical side. I know passion alone doesn’t pay the bills. I’m already an adult, and starting music seriously at this age feels risky and maybe unrealistic. I keep asking myself:   – Is it even possible to make a living from music at this point?   – Am I being irresponsible for wanting to give up a “stable” career path?   – How do people actually transition into music without ending up broke or regretful?  I’m not expecting instant success or fame. I just want a life that doesn’t feel empty or forced. I’m looking for genuine, realistic advice—especially from people who’ve switched careers, pursued music, or balanced passion with financial stability.  Any perspective would really help.

            "comments": "is it even late? 23 is so young, you have all the time on the earth.|||As someone who switched career and followed my passion much much later than you and is now happy with my decision, here is my advice.  1. Acknowledge that it is going to be very very very difficult. It will take its toll mentally. You'll have days/weeks/months/years of frustration where it will just be you and the piano. The audiences come later. You and your craft and the process. That is all you'll have to live with for a very long time.   2. People in your lives will constantly question your choice. Your family, your siblings, your friends, your loved ones. Almost everyone will tell that you're not being realistic. This will continue for the rest of your life. Be prepared for that.  3. Think hard what success means to you. Being rich and famous through arts is pretty rare in this country. You'll most likely never make a lot of money, have a rich lifestyle. Are you willing to change the definition of success to 'waking up every day and getting to do what you love'? It is okay if you want a more comfortable life. You'll have to decide.   4. It will take you a long time to get good at your craft. Get a formal training if you can. Once things get to a higher level, you might discover that you don't like it all that much.  5. If you want a more comfortable path to transition, you'll have to work twice as hard. Get a job and train yourself. Build savings and switch.  6. Build a good support system around you because that will be the difference between plunging into depression and staying mentally healthy.  6. Most importantly, have fun. None of this matters if you are not enjoying it, have a great set of friends around to share it with.  This is what I have for now. Cheers!|||23. How much do you watch social media? These things influence you a lot more than you realize. Planting ideas into your head about people living the live without having to give up anything. Yeah right.   I’m 45. Let me tell you. Anything worthwhile in life is going to be tough to get. A good spouse? You gotta put in a lot of work into the relationship. A nice big house? Be prepared to sink 10+ years of your life working your ass off to pay for it. A shiny degree? 2-4 years of your life being absolutely miserable learning all you can about your subject. A good physique? You guessed it. Sweat and tears at the gym for months before you see anything.   Engineering is not easy. Music is not easy. You can do the easy parts of it and feel good about it but mastery of anything is hard. Because it is mastery.  Rethink your decision. Base it on what really matters to you. Because either way you’re gonna have to put a shitload of work in.   Whatever you’re imagining putting into your engineering field imagine going through it again but for your piano. It’s not the easy way. You’ve already spent so much energy and pain into graduating in eng. think very carefully if you wanna go through the exact same thing with music cuz the grass will always look greener on the other side.   My recommendation is to do both. Work and find time for your hobbies. Focus on financial stability. You’re 23.

It is only required to enter to US & it is stamped on the passport which US immigration use to verify that you're a legal alien entering the country. If your visa stamp is expired but your visa status is not expired, you can legally be within the US but you cannot enter US if you travel outside the country. For most of the country, visa stamping needs to be done from their own home country. It can done from US as well but it's a very lengthy process, so most H1B holders prefer stamping in their own country. Yes, Nepalese also need to do this from US Embassy in Kathmandu. The reason why we don't see such thing in Nepal is because 70% of H1B holders are from India and Trump is now cracking down on immigration and making it harder for non-US citizen to live and work.",

So I want to ask:  * Is it **realistically possible** to get an IT job without an IT degree? * Do companies actually hire based on **skills, projects, and portfolio**, or is the degree a hard requirement? * Should I continue pushing into IT and build strong projects, or would it be smarter to **switch to a different career path**?

Many companies now focus more on what you can actually build and how well you solve problems. A strong portfolio of real projects often matters far more than a formal degree, especially for junior roles or in smaller teams and startups.  The key is showing that you truly understand what you are building. When you create projects with Python and Django, make sure you can explain every decision, why the code works that way, and how you fixed bugs along the way. Interviewers notice quickly if someone has deep understanding or just followed tutorials without grasping the concepts.  If you are genuinely interested and enjoy the process, keep going. Passion makes learning faster and helps you push through tough parts. But if you are forcing yourself into IT just for the job prospects without real curiosity, it can become very hard. Even people with degrees struggle and burn out when the interest is not there.  Your current path of self-learning and building projects is one of the best ways in. Focus on finishing a few solid applications, put them on GitHub, and start applying widely. Many developers broke in exactly this way. Stay motivated and keep building.",

I could help you and guide you but it will not be an easy task. But in general here is what you will do:  * First develop an interest in any field. You mentioned AI somewhere. But that is too vague. Narrow it down a lot. For example: sentiment analysis of Social Media users towards upcoming election. * After finding an interest, you will try to find relevant published papers. You can simple do google search. You do not need to look every words in it. Just read abstract, find out what was their motivation, what data/methodology they used and how are the results.  * A first good paper could be a review paper as well. It could be as simple as \"Comprehensive state of NLP in Nepali Language\". Here you will find all the available NLP papers written for Nepali language and summarize it. * After reading papers, you need to find a room for improvement, it could be like improving results, improving model's latency, parameters and so on.  * After fixing that, you need to summerize the relevant papers once again just to be sure that the task you are trying to do is novel. You can start wrting now. I prefer Overleaf. * Now comes the difficult part of doing the experiment. You will also try to reproduce the results from the papers you selected as a baseline paper.  * After getting satisfactory results, you can add them in draft. * Now tune the paper, fix errors and share it to others for feedbacks. * Finally select a journal and submit it there.|||If you Get the answer please care to tell me too|||Which degree|||First bhaneko Kun topic ma research garne ho, tesko past research paper haru khoja ani tyo paper ma bhako citations haru hera, yeti garesi ta start hunxa maajjale|||Same here   want to publish papers on ai and quantum physics|||you can get help of your professors. a good research paper ups the reputation of one's uni instantly so the uni'll help you alot|||ramro journals haru padha, aafno level ausar ko ani pick a good team,sakesamma ekjana professor ko guidance ma|||Hi! I am currently doing a research internship in physics. Publishing a research paper on your own is not easy. You usually need to work with researchers who are well-known in your field. Try to find people who are already working in that area and reach out to them. In my opinion, it’s best to first build a strong foundation in your domain and then start doing research.

            "body": "Context: I mistookly send money from bank's mobile app to a esewa number. The issue is Bank's apps don't show the name of person you are sending the money to unlike when u transfer esewa-to-esewa , you see the hint of the name at least ex. Hi\\*\\*\\* Basnet .    So, If you send money to wrong number and transaction is successful then :     1. Contact Esewa First in their contact number . I did a mistake by contacting Bank first. Bank said that once transaction is done , they can't do anything about it & told me to ask Esewa. U need to tell customer support the wrong number u sent money too so that they can freeze the money asap.    2. The support agent might ask u to write a email. so, I sent a email but then they said to send a handwritten one. So, Just send both typed & handwritten email in address below. Write ur details , send your transaction details and in which account you want it back (best to specifiy esewa account) and **Signature**.    3. After this, If you want to take other precautionary steps (Just in case) then you can call the bank if u want to But they will probably give same cliche rejection.    You can send a **formal message** in Sms & whatsapp to the wrong number to send you the money back IF his esewa account hasnt been froze and If s/he sent your money to some other account so that s/he doesnt need to return you the money. This message is important in case you might have to go through a police case or cybersecurity case.   4. Hopefully & usually, you don't need to go to police. If u contacted esewa support quickly and wrong account has been frozen then you will get a return email with a customer ticket. You or the number where you want the money back will be called by esewa for Confirmation. This might take 3-5 days. Then, the money is returned.    If you were anxious like me, you can call them in 1-2days interval to ask your ticket status.   https://preview.redd.it/yd070i71839g1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=82349ba235af07e8d2fe2b3061bd43c8cece5499  https://preview.redd.it/pmkej30z839g1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7c757d57b6061bac4acf5a0f4cd1708a258bea5  https://preview.redd.it/nu9q1otz839g1.jpg?width=3358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ce0f0cdfb3e2afeee5ede4eb6d53564ac154d09",

But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

There's some time when punjabi's come up to you and start talking. And you have no damn idea what that is.|||I see so many people here commenting in hindi as well like as a joke, memes pani hindi k, yo vloggers haru ni bich bich ma purai Hindi dincha, not to forget the annoying movie cuts that they think is funny. Hindi bolda testo annoying ta lagdaina thiyo hola if indians were respectful enough, not speaking for everyone but some just look down on us.|||I think two things can be true at once:  1. Having more languages is an advantage. Knowing Hindi can open doors of possibility so it is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think people should be taught Mandarin as well.  2. Most of our channels are in Hindi. We need to have some of the popular ones dubbed in Nepali. It will also provide job to translators and dubbers.  People should also keep in mind that Nepal is not just Kathmandu. Outside Kathmandu, when people say abroad - it is either India, Malaysia, or Gulf Nations.   About 2-3 million (i.e., 5-6% of Nepali currently study or work in India) and this is how they are managing to send funds back to their family. If they did not know Hindi, it would be hard for them to adapt.|||I agree lol. Baira sab indian ayera hindi bolna thaldinxan.

It's better to learn Chinese than Hindi from a purely logical pov|||Knowing a language is always a good thing, and if the indian person has to communicate somehow in Nepal so it is not a problem if they use Hindi to communicate.      You know where the problem lies? We imitating extravagant foreign customs like haldi, mehendi, sangeet, dhanteresh, baby shower etc. This is what is going to erase our identity.|||Yeah. Fck hindi|||Nepali uses Devnagari script which is also originated in India, maybe stop using that as well?|||As a human, isn't it better if you know more languages? Same as saying I know Python, C, Java.....|||Lol.  Firstly, I think Nepalis being able to speak Hindi is a plus point. It makes us multilingual, which makes them comfortable. We've always prided ourselves for being more tolerant than India and also hospitable. I don't see a problem in using a language that we know. If you go to Spain and you talk to people in English, are you expecting people there get offended too? And before you say English is an international language, Spanish has more speakers than English.   Secondly, Nepal is not just Kathmandu. There are communities in the south that use Hindi as their language. Even Nepali marwadis in Kathmandu use it. It is one of the 120+ languages used in Nepal. You saying Hindi bad kinda implies they are not Nepalis.   Thirdly, you make an issue with Indians assuming Nepalis are Indians, while you're similarly assuming India is just north India. South Indians generally don't speak Hindi. They speak English. South Indians have a much better impression of Nepal.   Indians generally don't think Nepal is a part of India. But we're bordered with UP and Bihar, which are not exactly places that are particularly respectful. A lot of them think Nepal is a place with similar cultures so it's a safe and beautiful place to visit where they don't have to deal with much cultural shock. It's just that they often overstep boundaries (pun intended) and try to get overly close, which kind of freaks us out because Nepalis are more reserved than Indians imo.|||Protect your language and mother tongue.|||This post has been tagged as serious.

Most Indians understand Nepali, and many of them actively try to learn it as well. One Indian colleague even speaks Nepali as fluently as we do.  Over time, you realize that people genuinely make an effort to learn each other’s languages. South Indians generally have strong English skills, but many of them don’t speak Hindi, while people from other regions may not speak English as fluently. So they talk in Hindi when they saw us.|||Hindi xodeiu sathi ma mandarin pani sikdai xu largest diaspora, you don't know how easy it will be once you able to connect with them in their language.

Lol, they don't even know the patriotism of a Bangladeshi.|||knowing english doesn't makes you american.|||There are better problems to worry about|||I don't think Hindi is the problem but the real problem is our failure to not prioritize our own language and culture. I was surprised to learn that China and Korea mandate all their cartoons to be in their own language and that is just one example but for me Nepali feels quiet foreign and as someone who did my entire schooling in Nepal upto +2, I don't know how to read Nepali fluently and have a terrible handwriting. I dont even think in Nepali for the most part as most of the cartoons back in my day were all in English.   So, I think what is happening now is that we are trying to rescue a building that is already burned to ashes and blaming things that have nothing to do with us. India is a massive country and just a few encounters with a few assholes shouldn't be generalized. I lived in India for 4 years for my Bachelors and I would find a few of such people that were illterate and assumed Nepal speaks Hindi but I had the vast majority that did not have that assumption. What we need now is to rebuild what has been burned as atleast I feel like I have already suffered the damages. We need to focus on teaching kids to be comfortable with Nepali just as much as Hindi and English. I think having Hindi as an additional language is almost like a superpower as you get access too all their free educational content on Youtube and its always a better thing to know a few extra languages. I think this anti Indian sentiment will really hurt us in the long run and we need to make sure we have diplomatic and peaceful ties with both our neighbors|||Yes, we should not normalize Hindi..   But to m,e to our family, it is a need to know hindi not because of Hindi songs or Bollywood or series, but it works for us....   I waited for a psychologist for 1.5 months...such a condition requires emergency...a lot of medical needs require emergency...not everyone can afford flights ....and India, just a 2-hour ride or 5-hour ride can get you one of the best medical personnel.....   there are not good doctors here or even specific no doctors here...

A lil bit of my story id like to share here. My dads sorta nonchalant and doesnt really show much love to my mom every now and then but its not that he doesnt love her. Ofc he does but he has become a lil more expressive in these few years. Thats maybe cuz when i was a kid, no one would be there to guide him or at least teach him how to show love. Ani mero mumma chai ekdamai childish and clingy cuz shes the youngest and most loved. Ani as my dad didnt really like those things being all clingy, romantic stuffs and every other couple things earlier, they used to fight a lot verbally not physically. But growing up, i defended my mom, became her best friend to talk to and to visit places and also involved my dad in those things and then he started doing all those romantic and cute stuffs like bringing flowers sometimes, gifting her something sweet or like just talking to her sweetly and showing a bit more of love and affection. And to see that change on my dads behavior is something that ill cherish forever. Ani aile aba they know that im able to identify many things and they actually believe that i can teach them something, ani ma papa lai yesto garshyo mumma will like it type of advice haru and all dirakhthe ani my nonchalant and baap wala dad has become a more softer, lovable and cutiepatotie version in these years.   So, i feel like my dad just followed what my grandfather did to my grandmom. He didnt know how to show love cuz he never saw what it looks like but after these many years and with my little bit of guidance and direction, he has changed and my mumma really really likes the way he is right now and is happier than ever.|||Great that you see the great example for men and also having similar standard.

The Imax film is insanely huge. Transporting it safely, then a team who can actually operate IMAX is needed and the cost is obviously gonna be off the charts. Plus, most people in Nepal won't even be able to afford tickets. So it's highly unlikely we'll get IMAX thetre anytime soon.

Hopefully we do.|||Nope: imax is expensive tech. License will cost millions: tickets will be in thousands. It’s impossible to achieve scale with this technology.|||Who's gonna invest? Who's gonna watch? I also think IMAX would be great and would like to watch movies there, but I don't see a big market for both investors and people who watch it. Normal Hollywood movie nai 600+ xa tickets aile. Jhan IMAX ayo vani 1800+ hunxa sure. Who's gonna watch paying that much? Maybe there are some rich people BUT not big enough market for investors to feel secure of ROI.|||IMAX ma movie herna paunu would be a dream come true. I think it’s a dream for many of us cinephiles. But to be realistic, there’s no way we’re getting IMAX here in Nepal.  As many people in the comments have already mentioned, it’s expensive, hella expensive. Bringing IMAX itself is costly. Then there’s the cost of maintenance and operation, which is huge. I don’t think any sane investor would want to take that risk.  Even the cinema halls we have right now, which I won’t say are great, but are at a decent level, aren’t able to upgrade themselves properly or even run consistently. So there’s no way IMAX is happening.  I also read some of your other comments where you said many cinephiles would be willing to come to Kathmandu to watch movies in IMAX. I agree. For any cinephile, watching their favorite movie in IMAX would be a dream come true. But IMAX isn’t a one-time thing; it needs regular footfall. No one is going to keep coming to Kathmandu every time just to watch a movie. It’s not time-feasible, money-feasible, or practical in any way.  Even in India, with such a massive population, maintaining IMAX is a big challenge. Now think about Nepal. Nepal is a small country with a relatively small population. There’s simply no way IMAX could sustain itself here.  On top of that, I recently read that many youth-focused businesses, movies, restaurants, cafes, clothing stores, are already struggling because the youth population is decreasing. Compared to decades ago, there are far fewer young people in the country now. Even these businesses are finding it hard to survive.  In a situation like this, there’s no chance anyone will invest in bringing IMAX to Nepal. Realistically, we’re never getting IMAX here because we just can’t sustain it.  That said, like you, I also wish I could watch my favorite movies in IMAX. IBut yeah I was just being realistic.|||if there was market to justify the investment, we'd have IMAX already.|||I don’t think there’s a market lol. Even regular prices are expensive, imagine double triple that.|||We don't need that shit. We just need a 4k native screens.|||It does not|||No, the maintainance cost is too high for IMAX|||No|||Skyrocket on Popcorn, and cold drinks price|||Nope.|||Noo lmao  Probably wouldn't succeed to run it|||yes we do and people worry about a their wallet. imax provides movie experience than any other cinema they use cameras used for space the quality of the is 4k from a projector the sound is ass shattering and i think a 1000rs is justifiable|||I votes yes cus I would also want those exclusive popcorn buckets and even some freebies and the most important of all those 4d seats|||Unless Nepali film industry makes 10 imax movies atleast a year, it will never happen, it’s that simple.|||No. You would be in the minority who would pay 1000+ for imax tickets. There's a reason why even places like australia, the vast majority of the population does not care about imax. Also, how many movies are actually made for imax, very few so its really not that important.|||Have you watched avatar 3 ?|||Bro these comments. 1000rs ma Imax re bro are u fr? India 1000 ic ma herya yaad cha malai. Nepal ma 2-3K ko range ma huncha lol. or even more|||![gif](giphy|spfi6nabVuq5y)|||What's ISMX Cinema? 📽️|||'Because  ~~Batman~~ imax is the hero  ~~Gotham~~ nepal deserves, but not the one it needs right now  ![gif](giphy|B4jfJqiIxvU08)  .|||Avatar 3 esmai herna paye hunthyo 60 fps ma 🥲|||Im not that huge into film but i have tried going to nepal ko movie hall and i have experienced imax aswell, honestly couldnt tell the difference|||Ya'll don't have one ???  Atleast in sl, the tickets are double the price. If it's worth it or not is upto the individual but it's for sure a different experience. If u dont like cinema's in general then Imax won't change it. If u do, then yes it's worth it but for select movies which are almost all Hollywood ones.|||Yeahh broo Nepal ma ni auta imax theater ta hunu parni ho k manchhe haru lai India janu parchha|||Not a big enough market to sustain. Maybe during big blockbuster releases they might be able to sell a few tickets. But most of the year they'd have to endure a huge operating cost. Maybe in a few years it might be viable but as an investor better put money elsewhere|||As a movie lover, yeah.|||What is one less than imax? I think that might be better.|||the amount it would require to build one is too expensive and i don't think nepal has any malls that would be able to incorporate it.|||Not worth it|||Actual imax theater hunu paryo not that digital one.|||tbh maybe no.. cause i am in nyc rn and a regular imax goer. to function the imax screen is no joke the cost is sooo high that only few theaters can afford. even in usa these are not very common. tho there are talks about installing new screens across the country before The Odyssey but the same problem,,, it is so expensive.  and again not every movie shines better on imax screen. most of the movies looks awful. I think Nepalese market is not sustainable enough to afford it rather i would love to see cheaper theaters in Nepal that will make footfall larger ig.|||hamro biratnagar ma vako eauta QFX pani jalaidiyen|||For entertainment yes, for the business , heck no.|||Even India just hv one true 70mm (15/70 projection) IMAX.|||No|||imax worthy movies eta dherei release nai gardenan vako navako eutei ho|||No|||NO, and its in caps.

Your point?  Religious leaders have always been predatory. If Epstien was born 1500 years ago, he wouldnt have been the prophet of Islam but rather his own religion that wouldve leagalized sex slavely of marginalized children. Also, Epstien was a European Jewish, not a middle eastern muslim. This makes more sense as he is reported to have been meeting leaders from a genocidial regime where a lot of sex offenders flee to when they're caught for their crimes. (People call it is not real)  The thing is, people would make any man who said, \"God visited me in my dreams\" or \"I am the son of God,\" their prophet and women who said it, they would treat her as a schizophrenic. Just look at what they did to Joan of Arc when she said that Gkd told her to.lead an army. Theres also the origin of Mormanism. If you look into it, the dude bullshitted out of being caught about bullshitting. And that religion itself is so fucking predatory and oppressive that Christians dont even view them as Christians but like a cult. Do you know how bad you have to be if no branch of Christianity considers you to be Christian? Really fucking bad. Jahovah's witness ko ta kurai nagarm. If religion was made for community, then Jahovah's witness was made to isolate people and remove happiness from the world.  Don't get me wrong, I have my own issues with Islams (the way bangladeshi killed that hindu man was uncalled for even if their allegation was true) Infact, I have my issues with all the Abrahamic religions as they all treat other religions the same way: with contempt and a sense of arrogance. They have destryoed a lot of cultures and history all around the world because, \"God wills it.\" And they still continue to fight amongst each other because they dont realize that they serve the same god.  This doesnt mean that the Hindu religion is perfect. Aata ni bhagawan ko naam ma kati dherai atrocities committ bhaeko xha, especially against women ra \"lower\" caste ka manxhe haru, and even homosexual ra transgender manxhe haru (but that was most likely the result of EIC meddling in Nepal ko politics and that turned into religion) and all that. Mero bua ko phupu didi was widowed at 16 because she got married to an old man at a very young age, you know why? \"Means huno bhanda aagadi chori ko bihe bhayo bhane chori pakkai swarga ma janxhe.\" Sounds like making a way for a pedophile to marry a young girl to me.  You can critisize Islam for having a pedophile for a prophet and how it doesn't condem pedophilia. I do too. Tara you cannot act like every other religion isnt the same when it comes to protecting and enabaling pedophilia kinaki every religion has had a pedophile and predators leading their place of worship, and even hinduism, because the title comes wirh protection for their crimes and devotion from the people, and LOTS and LOTS of money. Catholicism ko ta kura nai nagaram cause Catholic priests haru le bhurabhuri haru lai molest gareko ta sterotype nai bhaisakyo.  Dont make this thing with Epstien a religion issue, its a politics, pedophilia, and a money issue. I am sure ki there are many richer than the world muslims who visited the Island, but the key word here is RICH. Epstien would let anybody in the island as long as they were rich, or a child they can exploit.|||I can't believe day would come nepali liberals will defend literal pedophile in comments not talking about epsiten btw|||Most people were Epstein 1500 years ago chill.

And honestly, he’s doing a great job.  This has been his approach for a long time. Even when he was at the Nepal Electricity Authority, he used the same method, visiting sites and dealing directly with contractors. There are even videos of him giving direct order to them. This time as well, he’s doing a solid job. Ever since he took charge of the ministry, he’s been working tirelessly, visiting sites, reviewing the progress of projects, and staying involved in the details. The same goes for the Finance Minister and the Education Minister, they also seem to be working really hard.  Coming back to Kulman Ghising, it’s clear that he has long-term plans. He has already said that he will be contesting the election, and I’m pretty sure he’s thinking ahead. If he wins the election, he’ll likely return in full action mode, and all this groundwork will help him once he’s back in power.  Overall, I’m really satisfied with his work. Recently, I also read that the Department of Roads has restarted its road maintenance ambulance service. Now whenever there’s an issue on the road, like potholes, they’ll respond immediately. I even saw him inaugurate those Ambulance a couple of weeks ago.  So yeah, overall, he’s doing a very good job, and I’m quite satisfied with the work he’s doing right now.|||He deserves the accolades.

            "body": "**Read this first:** Y*es I am not very well with my english writing skills ( got 6.5 on IELTS ), hence i've used a bit of help from AI tools but this is my real story with the same ideas and experience. This was supposed to be a reply for a post on Nepal Social asking people abroad if it was a good idea to go abroad to study, when replying it got a bit long, so i decided to have it as post instead, maybe it could help somebody who is in a dillema if they should jump on the abroad boat or not. Sorry, Go ahead.*     To everyone back home dreaming of the \"abroad life,\" I want to share a perspective from someone who is already here. We often think the grass is greener, but once you’re on the other side, the view changes completely. I moved to Canada to pursue a Computer Science degree, fueled by the idea that it was a stable, safe economy right next to the world’s tech capital. I took out a massive loan—70 lakhs NPR—just for tuition. At the time, it felt like an investment. Now, looking at the reality of the situation, it feels like a heavy weight around my neck.  The world changed faster than I anticipated. AI disrupted the entry-level tech market, Canada’s economy hit a massive slump, and the political climate has shifted toward a \"natives vs. immigrants\" narrative regarding jobs and housing. Despite my degree, I’m currently working in a warehouse just to survive. The immigration laws here change faster than Nepal’s government, and I’m constantly haunted by the debt back home. I often wonder: what could I have done with that 70 lakhs in Nepal? Even 10 lakhs as startup capital could have built a solid business with a real ROI. Instead, I spent $70,000 to get a degree, experience some racism, feel chronically homesick, and learn that if I get sick for even a week, my entire financial foundation could crumble.  Don’t get me wrong—I’ve learned invaluable life lessons here that I wouldn’t have learned in Nepal. But would I pay $70k for those lessons again? Hell no. I’ve realized that we often take Nepal’s beauty, our culture, and our support systems for granted. I came here looking for a better life, only to realize that the time we spend away is time we can’t get back. People change, societies change, and our responsibilities grow while we’re busy chasing a \"dream\" that might be an illusion. My goal now is simple: pay back this loan and go home. I love Nepal, and I’m coming back. I’ll return to the West as a tourist one day, sure, but my life and my future belong at home. If you're thinking of leaving, just remember: \"abroad\" isn't a magic fix—it’s just a different, and often much more expensive, set of problems.",

AI and a weak economy destroyed entry-level tech job prospects.   Working in a warehouse despite having a degree just to survive.   Faces changing immigration laws and rising \"natives vs. immigrants\" tension.   Missed the chance to use that capital for a startup in Nepal.   Deals with racism, homesickness, and zero financial safety net.   Realized the \"abroad dream\" is often an expensive illusion.   Goal is to pay off the debt and return home to Nepal permanently.|||I stopped reading after the word computer science|||Where the hell did u go to clg ? 70k for some shitty university is deadass idiotic decision|||Hey OP. Thank you for your post.  I’m a Canadian, I was born in Canada and have watched this country change from a dream into a nightmare over the last 20 years.   Nepal is my second home and I just arrived back in Canada from Nepal less than 24 hours ago.   Every single Nepali I meet says how lucky I am to live here, but the reality is exactly how you describe it.   I try to suggest to people in Nepal if possible go to Canada or elsewhere abroad for a 6 month or year plan, at the most. I know this would be extremely difficult visa wise but I think there is not the concept of how hard life is here compared to Nepal in every aspect possible.   The water and clean air and infrastructure here is huge of course.. but.. everything else? What else is there here that is better than Nepal? I can’t think of anything. Maybe it’s jet lag talking buttttt this is how I see it.|||Abroad isn’t Instagram reels or a “good life” it’s mostly a struggle. If you don’t earn well you live on bare minimum  around 60% goes to expenses and the rest decides your future. So plan properly. Go with a backup plan, not a dream. Grind 5/10 years, save hard, build assets, and stay open to both options settling there or coming back. Don’t return broke and hopeful you'd just be trading countries for struggle. Being born in a developed country with a strong passport is a privilege; the rest of us grind so the next generation starts better.|||Touched by your experience and suffering. Don’t know what to say. Because im in Nepal. Doing IT job. Not in economic problems. But my friend’s abroad building home in kathmandu, buying card and luxury. So I was also thinking of going abroad (maybe Australia). Don’t know what to do|||What’s done done. Since you have a cs degree you don’t have to stick with on-site employments, look for remote jobs as well.|||70 lakhs? Going for a degree that costs 70L was a huge mistake especially if you are not financially well off.   I hope you get out of the situation you are in!|||You're completely fine and it happens all the time to everyone. Here's my story:      I left Nepal back in 08 to study Aeronautical Engineering. But then I switched to Physics… then Computer Science… then Computer Engineering because everyone kept saying “software ko market ta dherai ramro cha.”  First two years here were rough. Worked 12 hours a day, 5 days a week just to survive and pay tuition. Still had to take student loans (about 80KUSD, still on a payment plan) because whatever I earned wasn’t enough since i was in an expensive city. And because of all the switching and one very bad semester where I got straight F’s, my 3–4 year bachelor’s took me 7 years.  The F’s hurt extra because I was one of those “90%+ in SLC, 79% in +2” kids. Life is funny like that.  Anyway, I graduated, got a corporate job in 2015, and got fired after a year and a half because I overstayed in Nepal. Then jobless for almost 2 years. Somehow landed a dream job in my dream company — the one starting with T, run by EM. Worked there 5 years, got laid off in 2022.  Tried dropshipping, day trading, opened kiosk at the mall and now I run a small business. Honestly, I’m happier now. What I’m trying to say is: life has its own weird trajectory. You do what you can depending on where you are in life.  But just because it has been working out for me doesn’t mean it’ll be same for everyone. I personally know people who stayed in Nepal and are doing insanely well compared to what I see here. I also know people in the US who are still struggling even with family support, degrees, everything. After 17 years here, with plenty of ups and downs, one thing I’ve learned: there will always be people doing better and worse than you. You’ll catch some opportunities, you’ll miss others.|||Its not the 90s anymore..   Internet exists... Internet forums exists.. social media exists..   I joined reddit over 10 years ago, and i've seen similar posts thousands of times..  what did you expect was going to happen?? Trudeau would wait for you at the airport?

A decade ago it was like ‘oh let’s be a doctor, let’s do engineering’ that was fine back then. No huge impact of AI, good career. Nowadays, people making money from tiktok, youtube. If you get scholarship, worth it to pursue abroad otherwise do something with that money in Nepal.  I would rather go to village and die in that beautiful hajurbuwa ko land 🌹|||Yeah, abroad is nowhere how it looks for people living in Nepal. Everything here is diff, it's funny how priority changes for people who goes to abroad. Bihana belka khana vanda priority ghanta Hanna hunxa cause khana you need money. Time is calculated as money, aba Nepal ma huda j vaye ni, some may say that's how life should be treated as Tara in abroad it's not just about money at that point survive garira jasto ni lagdaina. But k garnu seeing other people all around us doing that,  that's what's keep us going. Stayyy strong, in fact we should, now that you have come at least this far|||I came to Canada as an international student too but I chose a diploma, not a degree. I took loans of 30k+, completed my diploma, and focused hard on skills, communication, and work ethic rather than just the certificate.  I didn’t land a white-collar job on day one. I worked my way up through retail sales, including Best Buy and Leon’s Furniture, learned how businesses actually run, how to sell, how to deal with people, and how to perform under pressure. Today, I work at Intact Financial Corporation, earning a salary good enough to clear my entire loan within a year. I’m the youngest person at my location and the only one with just a diploma, not a degree.  So yes, Canada is tough. The economy is bad. Immigration rules change. But getting stuck in a warehouse is not the country’s destiny it’s a skill ceiling. If someone stops upgrading themselves, networking, and positioning their experience properly, they stay in the same loop anywhere in the world Canada or Nepal.  Abroad is not magic, but it’s also not a scam. It rewards people who adapt, build marketable skills, and understand how the job market works. A degree alone doesn’t guarantee anything - talent, strategy, and execution do.  Same Canada. Same challenges. Different choices. Different outcomes.|||I have a different story in Canada. I chosed a very cheap but reputable university spent like $16-20k for degree. Landed job right after graduation. Earning pretty well above average atm.|||[deleted]",

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

But, they have specified that a portion of internal marks should be given based on attendance too. You should receive less marks in the attendance portion of internal marking according to NEB, but I highly doubt that would happen.|||Yes yes but I think you're not from jhapa",

From grades 8–10 I took home tuition, but for +2 it’s really expensive, so I want to switch to group tuition at a centre. I’ve also tried online tuition before, but I honestly couldn’t focus well. In a proper class setting, I do much better, so a tuition centre is what I’m looking for.  I’ve looked on Facebook, but all I find are home tutors. I want to know where I can actually look for tuition centres that offer group classes.  Also, for people who have been to such centres before, I wanna ask how much do they usually charge and are the classes held every day or around 2–3 days a week?",

If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

It isn’t a decision on whether they did the crime, it’s just a way to let someone live their life until the judge or jury makes a final decision. This is usually done if the person in question does not have a high risk of escaping or evading from police.",

So, the deposit is taken,  cannot escapse the country but can roam inside the fix territory|||In simpler terms, it is similar to a security deposit (refundable), not a fine/penalty. The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited. Otherwise the money is returned after deducting some applicable court fees (if any) once the case is closed or a sentence is made.|||Exactly as you said if defendant is not flight risk and not risk to himself or others they can pay bail to wait for court date. Free up resources.|||In common law, right to bail or presumption of bail is based on the severity and the offense and the likelihood of accused posing an unacceptable risk to the community. Financial crime (white collar crime) usually favours bail provision once the defendants satisfy no flight risk.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds.

European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.  Impossible ta haina tara depends upon how you present yourself, English language skills, communication, and core skills|||i mean it's ezz|||I need some Web framework and ML developer|||I thought landing a remote job meant living the good life.   I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

RSP will be the second-largest party after CPN-UML, with Congress coming in third. They won’t agree on many decisions, but a new government will still be formed. Congress and UML will form a coalition government with RSP, telling Ravi that failing to do so could mean the death of “democracy” in Nepal and urging him to put aside his ego for the greater good. Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research.

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.

I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Agreed.

So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.

I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||Speak whatever the f you want and don't make it a national issue.

I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop.

Most of the people in brazil speak Portuguese, does that change their identity? Most of the people in nigeria speaks english, does that change their identity?   Also just to let you know we share almost exactly the same culture, there is no difference.  No one is forcing you to speak hindi, even in india, many people can't even understand a word of it.   No need to hide the hate behind the words like 'our own identity's or ' our culture' or anything else. You directly say you hate indians, why? it's a trend now days to hate indian culture, skin colour, language or anything that comes from india.  You can google how much india has contributed in the development of nepal and also how nepal has contributed to the development of India. You will see the clear difference in how much India has helped  your country, but still if you want to fall for a trend then go on, we won't care cause we won't be affected.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||After reading all the comments I got to know that nepalis hate indians to the core just one bad instinct is enough to rage them against indian.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place.

Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.",

On top of that, the whole Gen X/Y/Z framework is deeply American-centric and doesn’t translate to Nepal at all.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

            "body": "Bail does not mean someone is innocent or guilty. It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being.

If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them.

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited. Otherwise the money is returned after deducting some applicable court fees (if any) once the case is closed or a sentence is made.|||Exactly as you said if defendant is not flight risk and not risk to himself or others they can pay bail to wait for court date.

I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

Kehi galat nagaresi..  Also uhako math book ta padhekai ho|||You are expecting research contributions from him? But have you done a research about him? His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

That's what it is supposed to do. Now make a portfolio. Having both cert + portfolio is good.

Are we really not cooking enough?   where are folks doing -    \\> tinkering on Linux - sharing dotfiles   \\> creating small scripts that does something niche and useful   \\> Talking about tools created out of nothing for the home setup   \\> Talking about algorithms and weird things they made on weekend   \\> Talking about microsetup they do - to be productive   \\> Talking about compilers, neural networks, assembly and trying different languages working on leisure  It's always about, Either we do job or not - or are we creating startup or not.   That's not bad but we can be more curious isn't it?",

It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels. At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update.

Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way.

Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

Reading the other comments got me thinking  1. Being abusive only escalated things. 2. What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies . Most people outside KTM actually hate the protests as they've seen the burning images of government properties.|||It's necessary that they unite and they must too.

Congress and UML will form a coalition government with RSP, telling Ravi that failing to do so could mean the death of “democracy” in Nepal and urging him to put aside his ego for the greater good. Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election?

What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

Khatey khatua haru|||She didn’t say anything bad about musims living in Nepal. Its weird how Muslims were celebrating Mamdanis election win as their own, taking pride in it. Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

NOC ko lagi matra ho. I can guarantee you: Nepal ma law padhera, +2 ma you can be a doctor in the US. Don't worry about that path.    Now, +2 ma business Ra Tesko paxi law, or vice versa. Again, it doesn't matter; a good argument is that you enjoy business, so you would've gotten something out of it, but sometimes life isn't linear.    If you want to study in the US, you need a bachelor's degree before a law degree(juris doctor or JD), so you can do your bachelor's in business. If you want to study in any other country, you could easily dual-major in business + law.    Don't worry!|||Bro same I'm studying law in grade 12 rn 11 ma huda ni law padhne bela ekdam josh thiyo but as time passed by I started hating it 12 ta omfg i can't imagine (Legal drafting/Civil and criminal law/Nepalese legal system) is gonna take my life too many things to note down.I think it's better to go abroad after+2 you can pursue law in another country rather than here.

            "body": "I'm currently looking at my options for a Bachelor's degree here in Nepal. I have a 3.0 GPA (science). I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",
