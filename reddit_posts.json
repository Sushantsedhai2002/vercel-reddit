            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

Oh wait. he doesnt listen. wait for him to say in Facebook, if he ever think about it. natra aash gara basa|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||Pokhreli|||average phenomenon in the South Asian cultural circle|||Same ma 11 12 ma huda ghar tadha vako le bus ma 1.5 hrs aagadi chadna parthyo khaltai khalto ko bato aauda jada purai jyan dukhthyo jharni bela aayo vanesi tyo manxe ko vid dekhera purai stress hunthyo .

What “earning well” or “being rich” means will differ from person to person, but if you are creative and think a bit differently, there are genuine opportunities to make good money.  I am 24M, and I have already earned enough to build a new house, buy land, and make investments that are giving steady returns. My rental income / interests alone now matches what many consider a minimum wage job in Nepal. Aba eslai flex jasari vanea haina, but line vae you are welcome.  I agree that building one massive company or unicorn in Nepal is hard. But it is equally easy to build multiple small or medium income streams and make them work together. Tyo chai dherei le sochdaina. Ofcourse next Facebook is hard to be build in Nepal but Nepal can build 2 school management software sell it to 2 school ani also starting exporting them finger print device (this is very lame example but you get where i am going)  One big problem I see is how conventional people are about careers. Many wait for college to end, then wait for internships, then wait for referrals. Ani feri last maa nepotism vo vanera ultai runxan.  Send that email to an industry leader asking for work. Apply for remote jobs that pay in USD. Build skills that can be exported. Network aggressively. Be uncomfortable. Opportunities rarely come through formal paths in Nepal, but they do come if you knock hard enough.  People in my friend circle have achieved even more than I have, and I see this trend growing. More young people are figuring out how to combine remote income, local investments, and multiple side bets.  If things go right, building a 5 crore corpus while maintaining strong cash flow is not unrealistic. I am not saying 5 crore is some magical number, but starting from nothing and reaching that level in Nepal gives you freedom. Tespaxi i think its more of a choice if you want to work specifically for money or not. Hunata sabko afno life ra dream hunxa  Yes, it is not easy. And yes, people will say this only applies to tech. I disagree. Any field with a solid global market works. Nepal has an advantage: relatively cheap labor and living costs. If you can export your skills, services, or products to a stronger economy, the money is there.  Also $ huda sano sano investment opportunity cash in garna ni easy hune raixa.

But again this post is not about specific field, so it depends on your skill and industry. But i can help with some strategies i took and you can see if anything you can apply from it, so maybe you can achieve even better result.  Edit (IMPORTANT) - This is not about something specific or me trying to sell any course etc LOL. I achieved this with my tech + investment + some side business skill ani i was trying to tell how euta primary job + some smart investment can open door in Nepal vanera. I am not trying to promote any specific skill or industry. I was bit happy today hence shared this, take it as motivation or feel free to DM/ask me about anything specific if you think that can help. I posted this etikai.     Edit 2 - Maybe this all thing will be more relavant if you are from tech background. Because that helps to get USD earning which can be invested in Nepal better.

At some point there might be a recital from a specific passage from the Bible (especially if it's a Catholic wedding). During that time, they may hand out a piece of paper with said passage for you to recite after the priest. If not, it's still all good. Just repeat after the priest or stay quiet.   4) The bride and the groom will say their vows. Be absolutely quiet during this time.  5) Near the end, everyone will stand up. After the ceremony is over, the priest will say \"Amen\" and everyone says it after him.

I would scroll through Facebook only to read people saying shut up in the comment box of neta ji. Then I switched and started using Reddit recently and am quite satisfied but I could not find any specific groups to discuss politics. So, I have joined two of these popular social groups for Nepali and they are working well for me. I have found some genuine people with insightful comments in these groups. But, a few of us are just annoying. We are naming jholey, Harkey hawaldar, Mu-zi Miraj and this and that. Everyone would appreciate it if we take a couple minutes and clarify the problems and solutions rather than making negative comments. If we are in a rush, a down vote always works.|||😭😭😭😭|||Sahi kuro",

After reaching you have to pay 5000rs for a normal 34 page passport. You need a verification stamp which in my option is completely useless. (Your papers get checked later aswell!)  Then you go through biometrics which is another pain in the ass. During peak times the line wraps around the building and don't get me started on their \"lunch breaks\".  If you manage to finish your process, it's not done yet. Your passport still needs to be approved. There's another issue here; The server is NOT stable. My biometric data was \"lost\". I was given another date and had to come back again. THIS IS A HUGE HASTLE!!  After this you can only hope that it went through. You can check your updates on the Dept of Passport (Foreign affairs) website/app. In my case it took 49 days to print and 4 days to ship the passport.  IN TOTAL I SPENT 53 DAYS. Mind you this excludes the time I wasted when the server lost my data.  This process is really outdated and unstable. Please beware if you have to leave Nepal!

            "body": "I have been living abroad for a long time. I am an avid reader, especially of economics and geopolitics, and I have followed Nepal’s domestic politics and international politics closely.  I want to write this to directly translate my thoughts to fellow Nepalis, especially because an election is coming and people still have a chance to make a better judgment while voting.  First and foremost, there needs to be a reality check. Educated people can be dumb. English-speaking people can be dumb. People who dress well can be dumb. These traits do not guarantee political or economic understanding.  Coming to elections and politics. Under the current scenario, people must realize that the change happening in Nepal is gradual. RSP was able to gain a good number of seats in the 2080 election. They would likely have gained more seats in 2084. Now, with the election possibly coming in 2082, people should understand this clearly that even if RSP, along with figures like Balen and Kulman, wins (maybe with a majority), developing Nepal at the pace people expect is extremely difficult.  Take Bangladesh as an example. Look at the speed of its development and where it stands now. Or take Singapore. Do people really believe Singapore would be what it is today if the US fiat dollar system collapsed? Or take Japan. Despite being a highly developed economy, its long-term prospects are constrained by a persistently low birth rate. Development does not happen in isolation. It is embedded in global economic structures and the social system.   Nepal’s economic pattern is fundamentally different, which many well-educated people fail to acknowledge. It resembles the Indian system, but with subtle differences. We still try to run the country like a family-run business. This is completely different from banking-based economics and institutional capitalism. If one understands this, one also understands why Nepal remains underdeveloped. Culture, structure, and incentives matter more than slogans.  Another major misconception is the belief that old political parties failed. This narrative is pushed repeatedly, and many educated people fall into this trap. The irony is that it was the old political system that provided the platform for figures like Rabi, Balen, Harka, Gopi, and Kulman to emerge in the first place.  Politics is competition. If you win, you form the government. It is that simple. Why is this so hard to accept? Congress and UML won because they were able to form governments. Balen won, which is why he is the mayor. KP Oli won as a UML leader. The same logic applies to KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and Prachanda. You may not like it. I may not like it either. But facts do not change based on personal preference.  Saying someone should step aside just because they are old is not a political argument. You cannot outcast someone simply due to age. Listen to the current prime minister, Sushila,  and understand how difficult it is to manage an entire country. If someone else, maybe Balen or anyone else, can win that position through the election, then they should be the PM. Simple as that.  Disliking leaders is not analysis. Understanding systems is.",

People expectation is for corruption to get reduced, increased accounting and system to become more functional and result oriented.

Most people don't have that expectation.  > Another major misconception is the belief that old political parties failed. This narrative is pushed repeatedly, and many educated people fall into this trap. The irony is that it was the old political system that provided the platform for figures like Rabi, Balen, Harka, Gopi, and Kulman to emerge in the first place.  I couldn't disagree more. Yes the political parties, the whole lot of them, failed in terms of delivery and accountability. However, they brought together a democratic system that allows alternative voices and personal freedom, albeit a little shaky at times.  > Politics is competition. If you win, you form the government. It is that simple. Why is this so hard to accept? You may not like it. I may not like it either. But facts do not change based on personal preference.

People put so much into a degree, it's wild. Let the people decide.   > Disliking leaders is not analysis. Understanding systems is.

No need to remember the difficult name.|||Anck-Su-Namun    Anck-Su-Namun was betrothed to Pharaoh Seti I as his concubine, and even trusted by the latter to be his daughter's combat instructor. Treacherous she was, Anck-Su-Namun didn't bother to build a good image upon Nefertiri who harbored misgivings toward her and began an affair with Imhotep, the High Priest of Osiris, which was forbidden because no other man was allowed to touch her.  Having foreseen that Seti I would discover their forbidden love, Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun conspired to kill the Pharaoh. The two then killed Seti I and when Seti's bodyguards the Medjai rushed in to aid the pharaoh on Nefertiri's orders, Anck-Su-Namun convinced Imhotep to flee from the scene as she committed suicide in a bid to distract the guards, trusting his powers as the high priest of Osiris where he would resurect her.  Imhotep and his priests were ordered to perform the concubine's funeral services shortly after her death. It entailed casting soul-condemning spells on her corpse, removing her heart (normally left within a mummy) along with the rest of her vital organs, and burying her remains in the middle of the desert. In addition, the slaves present were ordered to bury the body and be killed by the soldiers present. The priests murdered the soldiers in order to keep the location of Hamunaptra a secret forever. Imhotep broke into Anck-Su-Namun's crypt at night and stole her body. He then took it to the necropolis Hamunaptra, also known as the City of the Dead. Here, the blasphemous priest attempted to resurrect her using the forbidden Book of the Dead, unaware that he was being watched by the Medjai. The ritual was cut short before Anck-Su-Namun's soul could properly return to her mortal body, the canopic jar containing her heart was smashed, and her soul was returned to the Underworld. Destroying her heart ensured that the ritual could never be completed. Imhotep's followers and the city guards on duty that night were sentenced to be mummified alive as a form of retribution, while Imhotep himself was cursed with the dreaded Hom-Dai and buried alive beneath Hamunaptra.  Imhotep was accidentally brought back by a librarian named Evelyn Carnahan who was Nefertiri's reincarnation in 1926 A.D. and set out to repeat the ritual that had been botched so many centuries before. Imhotep had been close to completing the ritual the previous time, requiring no sacrifice, but after three thousand years, he needed a human sacrifice to provide Anck-Su-Namun with fresher flesh. After taking the Book of the Dead, finding Anck-Su-Namun's five sacred canopic jars, and choosing Evelyn, as his sacrifice, he found Anck-Su-Namun's body and tied Evelyn by her ankles and wrists to a sacrifice altar in Hamunaptra. Imhotep was about to kill Evelyn with a ceremonial dagger and carve out her heart as a replacement after reuniting Anck-Su-Namun's spirit and body, bringing her back to life, when Evelyn's brother, Jonathan, entered the chamber with the Book of Amun-Ra, the only force capable of killing the High Priest.|||try saying अनुकृति|||That is a difficult name for a native speaker.",

There is no way his demands are going to be fulfilled. The only thing the government can realistically assure is that elections will happen, but now he is against elections as well.  So what does he actually want? Does he expect the government to suddenly say, “Okay, we cancel everything because you are on a hunger strike”? I genuinely don’t understand.  What happens if his condition worsens and he faints? They will obviously take him to the hospital, right?

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Although PF amounts have been deducted from employees salaries, they have reportedly not been credited to the employees PF accounts for the past three years. Similarly, TDS was deducted from salaries but was never deposited against employees PAN numbers. I’ve heard that there are ongoing legal cases related to these issues. Several teachers who raised concerns were reportedly terminated, which may explain why there are frequent openings and many new vacancies for teaching positions at the college.

            "comments": "What a shit take! AI is there to make your learning easier, to make you understand concepts faster and better. Learning and understanding is important! How? Doesn't matter|||Oh it is the most useful thing in terms of learning. You can quickly learn things that would take hours before.  It will tell you line by line what each piece of code does. So if you don't understand something, just ask it will tell you in as much detail as you require. But you have to sit there and read.|||Not much. I don’t like hallucinated “ best practices “ examples|||adapt or perish|||Lol. I made it through my masters with AI. I would ask it questions and it would answer. Sometimes they were wrong. So I'd repeatedly ask until the answer made sense to me. I would definitely not take AI's word 100%   The thing that AI helped in was it directed me towards the right path. So if there was a concept I didn't know, I'd ask it and then I'd independently Google the terms AI mentioned. Then read research papers that explained it in more detail. If I didn't understand the paper, I copied the paragraph, pasted it in AI and asked it to explain it to me in simpler terms.   You just gotta know how to use AI.|||I do use it but not that much for new concepts, mostly to get sorta reminded as to how this thing worked or smtg like that. The times that i use ai for new concepts are when i am reading a book or have a cerdible src of information but i  cant get my head around a topic/concept. I dont particularly like it but why not use it if its available. I never use it for things that are completely foreign to me as i wont be able to tell hallucinations apart and will have to search for a credible src anyway.|||AI is helpful and it saves a lot of time . Now a days , I use chatgpt and grok first then move to youtube videos for better understanding .|||it is such a shit take, it's like saying i'd rather read from books then ever use google, first things first you should never use AI to try to thoroughly learn something. AI is for bits and pieces of information that otherwise would've taken ages to accumulate.  For example if i am reading a book or docs on anything and say i don't understand a given part , it could be some code logic or mostly it's me not understanding how certain concepts are \"worded\" as in the structuring of sentences not just the meaning of a word is quite complex certain times , i'd ask chatgpt (mostly for my lack of comprehension of certain sentences) to explain me the same thing in brief and i'd try to make sense of it with the actual text. So this is the first use case. Since my goal here is to learn certain programming concepts not english language it to me occurs like a compromise between my learning process and developing reading skills.  The second use case would be say if i was learning backend of something like that and i wanted to do something that'd require me to code up a frontend to execute certain api calls (i know you've got thunderclient or postman for the same use but for form data or images or audio files i'd always prefer a simple html form element be presented ) instead of coding that same thing from scratch i'd ask claude to generate me a simple frontend. In this regard it's simply more sensible to save time using AI rather than be too egoist to use it.  Really you can't learn a certain concept to its core using AI, it's just not possible so i agree with what the post says those three bulletins , but not the title of the post.  p.s. it has been easier to ask chat-gpt to find me a resource to learn something. Infact i started reading O'Reilly's because chat-gpt recommended me their books once and i started look around more about this publication. It's really easy to gather resource. I'd hundered percent use AI to help me learn something. And just a little hint if you ask any LLM for certain things and you are confused about the validity of the answer you can narrow your questions to that particular thing. Since it's a LLM it's can't possibly say \"i can't \" or \"i don't have information about it\" because it works on probabilistic model so it sends any result that gives the highest probability for a sequence of words as a response to a request. So you can't easily see the LLM struggling when even after a ton of clarification it sends the same result again and again it's just that amongst all the possible sequence of word it has the one sequences which is inherently wrong has the highest value of probability and since there are no other better sequences than that wrong one the LLM sends it back over and over|||Weird take, I mean if he enjoys the struggle then good for him. But I personally lose motivation to study if I encounter too many setbacks like getting stuck in a math problem or not understanding some concept etc. So I use AI all the time.",

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NepalSocial) if you have any questions or concerns.*|||2nd is bullshit|||As a regular member of this sub, here are my humble feedback. This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers.

When I used to post in r/Nepal, where flairs are mandatory, I was usually torn between which flair to choose as sometimes what you want to post does not fit into a specific category. For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard.

Don’t do any bad things here obviously this is not Nepal, know the country, their rules and respect it, you’ll be fine.

Pays ~150k annually, while this doesn’t help the feeling of living far from home country, but it pays for other stuff and you can get good car, buy own home, get better insurance and its set.  So my suggestion, get some experience in Nepal first, learn how to communicate, show up your skills and build your portfolio.|||Don’t come to conclusion with just  one  example. Earlier I saw a post where a nepali guy had $80k in his portfolio while working as student. These both are extreme examples.The guy in this post came to USA to study bachelor with full financial and social responsibility. Doing bachelor is always tough while working illegally for 4 years. I don’t encourage people to go for bachelor degree with their sole financial responsibility. With more effort and research, people end up in scholarship and low tuition fee college. This will change the whole dynamic of this situation. However, the grass is not greener at other side too. There will be challenges related to immigration and getting green card. Anyone can come embracing those challenges and keeping open mind.|||Its tough for students and it always has been. Struggle is part of life. Consistency is the key i think.

            "body": "Euta bro ko post dekheko thiye. Was pretty pessimistic but he told the truth. He said it from an undergrad PoV. I wanted to share some from masters PoV as well.  1) Sleep. Get ready to sacrifice sleep if you wanna come here. Undergrad or grad it doesn't matter. Even if you are fulltime student then the workload is intense and you will have sleepless nights. Education is hard just like in Nepal even if you are serious.  2) Food. Khana banauna chai sikera aam guys nabhaye behal huncha. Ani sikne matra Haina chiro pakauna sakne huna paryo. You won't have a lot of time. Bahira Bata magayera Khana sakidaina  3) Work. Masters ya PhD ma full funding ma aaunu. Pay garera aayo bhane kaam garne tei restaurant, gas station haru ma ho. Living expenses tax uthcha Tara fee tirna is impossible. And genuinely saying, those places are not safe.  4) Education. Study seriously. You will get a job, period. No plagiarism, seriousness throughout the semester, Nepal ma Huda jasari padchau tesari padeu bhane job paucha. Someone might ask \"IT ko kasto Cha\", more on that later.   5) Relationship. I was someone who always liked to live alone and even for me, it was hard. Eklai garo huncha basna. Try forming bonds and try talking to people. Basic socialization skill is underrated. Believe me, you'll need people so don't think I'm alone I can do whatever I want.  6)Income. Again, full funded master ya PhD ma aayesi, no issue. Pay garera aauda garo Cha. If someone is on a 100% tuition waiver and living expenses is the only issue, you won't have any problem. But if you have to pay fees you are fucked. If no fees, your income even with basic work(20 hours on or off campus) is sufficient to survive comfortably  7) Car. Car is need in US if you work off campus. College ma 20 hour matra kaam garne ho bhane chaiyena because you most likely will live around college.  8) Heath. Be super cautious with your health. You might think I have insurance , it will cover everything. Even the doctors And hospitals here don't know what will cover what. You could get bill of worth lakhs and crores if you are careless  9) Status. This is risky for everyone regardless of how you come. H1B is lottery based and now they have reduced the cap for entry level jobs. This is purely on luck. Permanently basna chai alik garai Cha. Might change in 3 years with another President but for now, it's bleak. If you think you'll struggle for 5 years and get greencard, those days are long gone. Either marry a citizen, or have the amazing luck of being selected on H1B and pray that employer files your greencard after that.  10) Now about job market. Here's the truth, University ma class regularly attend gareko Cha, relevant course haru leko Cha, exam Ani assignment cheating nagari fairly gareko Cha bhane job pauna sakcha. Nothing is ever guaranteed, but the country and the market is so huge that somewhere somehow people always need to hire someone. Now other things like networking, connection and internships makes your profile stronger ofc it does but don't listen to people who say job paudaina. Yes no one will hand you job on the plate but with good qualification you will get a job. \\[APART FROM IT/CS PEOPLE. ANYONE STUDYING CS IS NOT ENCOURAGED. PEOPLE ARE RETURNING TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS BLEAK BECAUSE OF LAYOFF, OUTSOURCING AND LOCAL KIDS STUDYING THIS, MARKET IS OVERFLOWED\\]  11) Master ya PhD ma full funding lyauna chai have good academics, learn English properly, get good score in standardized tests like GRE, yes take the GRE even when it's optional because professors still see the score, try doing research in bachelor and make good connection with seniors. Referrals work a lot and senior can recommend you to a professor if you have good credentials and good relationship to them. Take full advantage of this.  And approach professors properly. Etro Manche aairachan, you people can come too.   Best wishes people, drop comments if you have any. I'll try my best answering  TLDR: Paisa tirera aayo bhane garo Cha, full funding ma aaune, kasari paune bhanera thapauna chai purai padnu hola. Euta post pani padna alchi garne Manche Le full funding deserve gardaina LOL",

What I meant to say is that Balen has to resign from his mayoral position, and by bringing all this chaos, he would be nowhere and a nobody.   But also, from another point of view, what I came to know was that he doesn't have that many suitable candidates either to put on that Samanupatik list (Prakash Saput - who we've seen rallying for KP Oli in the past -  a Balen side's candidate), and similarly, seeing Kulman's relatives on that list tells the opposite.   It's a whole messed-up situation, I guess. Some people and the media are trying to establish the narrative that no one is perfect and that what's important is correcting mistakes on time. On the other hand, some people and the media are setting the narrative that they are no different from those old political parties.      Absolutely get the point that when top leaders team up at the last minute, there would be a whole lot of mess. But they are in no position, considering the political experience they have, to act as if they don't know what they are doing. They are in the public limelight (every step they are taking, people are following super closely) right now, rightly so, cuz people have started to believe that this is the one & only alternative force that can dethrone those 3 faces from politics that we have been hearing/seeing since we were kids.

Some of his demands are necessary and valid, but ideas like forcing Sushila Karki to resign or pushing for election delays are clearly being promoted by people who have no real concern for the welfare of those who suffered during the Gen Z movement.  My main concern with this new generation of political influencers....though that may not be the perfect term....is that many of them lack experience and proper grounding in practical politics. Because of this, they are extremely easy to manipulate and use.  The same risk applies to Balen Shah. This does not mean I don’t support him....I do. But figures like him, and people such as Ashika Tamang, need strong guidance and political maturity. Otherwise, they risk harming their own cause....afno khutta ma afai banchoro hanne situation huncha.|||PM ko rajina ma demand garnu is plain stupid so sorry I can't support.

Nine days without food is not a joke. It is a life-threatening situation.But what is more shocking is this: The mainstream media of Nepal is almost completely silent about it. no prime time debate,no breaking news,no major headlines. now ask yourself honestly? What if this hunger strike was done by Balen Shah? Would the media still be quiet? Absolutely not There would be: Continuous live coverage,Breaking news banners, Political leaders giving statements,massive social media campaigns So why is Dr. Nicolous Bhusal being ignored? Is his life less important because he is not a famous political figure? Is media only meant to cover celebrities and powerful personalities? This silence raises serious questions about media bias? this is not about politics,this is about basic humanity. Till now Routine of Nepal Banda has only 2 post for him.It is not about post.The way he circulate news. They have zero health concern about him. Look how the media writes the news as they are not concern about him.",

With elections now very likely, propaganda is about to go into full swing. Everyone needs to understand one thing clearly: this line of thinking, *at this moment*, will be weaponized to weaken RSP and strengthen the old parties. We should not fall for it.  Yes....accountability matters. Criticism matters. But timing matters more.  Right now, the priority should be to help RSP form a government through elections. After they are in power, we can...and should.....criticize them, pressure them, and hold them accountable for every mistake they make. That is how democracy actually works.  The idea of holding them fully accountable *before* elections sounds nice in theory, but in practice.....given the current political context....it only undermines RSP and indirectly benefits the old establishment.  Most people are not politically nuanced. They don’t read between the lines. Most of  the people couldn’t even detect sarcasm in my earlier posts. If that’s the case with Redditors, imagine the average citizen, who is generally even less politically aware.  My point is simple: this obsession with premature idealism doesn’t strengthen  RSP.....it strengthens the old parties. And whether intentional or not, that is the result it produces.  If we genuinely want change, we need to be strategic...not just morally performative.|||Told ya it was 12 bhai.

            "body": "“Please, have a seat.”  He says it with a smile that looks practiced. Like it’s part of the job.    “Shall we start now?”    He opens my file and starts flipping through it.     Middle-aged. Big mustache. slight belly. Wearing a watch that’s trying hard not to look cheap. I notice these things automatically. I don’t know why. Maybe because when you sit across from someone, you try to figure out what kind of person they are before they do the same to you.      “So, Mr. Prabhu” he says, looking down at the papers & adjusting his glasses “your CV says you have more than nine months of experience teaching mathematics for class eleven and twelve. But I don’t see an experience letter from your previous college. Usually they give one when you leave.”    “Oh, sorry about that, sir,” I say. “I thought mentioning the experience on my CV would be enough. I didn’t realize it had to be attached separately. But I do have the certificate here.”  I slide the paper toward him.    He doesn’t look like the type who cares much about recommendation letters, but I  still made a fake one. Just in case. you never know who suddenly decides to do their job properly.     He reads it. Slowly. Slower than I expected.  It’s just a letter. Still, he keeps reading. I wonder if he’s actually going through each line or if something about it feels off to him. I keep my face neutral. If he doubts it, he’ll ask. If he doesn’t, then it’s done.    After a while finally , he hums.  “They’ve used some strong word for you hah” he says. “And you completed the written test quite fast too.”    He looks up. “Mathematics is often seen as a scary subject among students. Would you agree?”  The first answer that comes to my mind is that math isn’t scary, students are just dumb. But I don’t say that. I need this job.  “Yes” I say. “Many students fear math. Not because it’s difficult, but because they fall behind early. Once that happens, they stop trying and blame the subject instead.     He listens without interrupting.    “I try to keep things strict in the beginning,” I add. “If students feel too comfortable early on, they stop taking the subject seriously.”  He nods and writes something down.     That part is true . just not in the way he thinks.     “Why did you leave your previous college?” he asks.  I smile.not too much.  “It wasn’t anything major,” I say. “Over time, I realized that the academic structure and learning environment there didn’t really match what i was looking for. I wanted more focus on practical learning and clarity in my direction.\"    That seems to satisfy him. like the answer confirmed something he already believed.     Outside the window, a group of students are crossing the courtyard. They’re laughing about something. None of them look inside the room.    The principal stands and offers his hand. I stand too. The handshake is firm. appropriate. forgettable.     “We’ll call you by tomorrow with our decision,” he says.  I nod. Thank him. Smile once more. Not too much.    As I walk out, I already have a fair idea of how this will go.  They never want honesty.  They want to feel reassured.  They want to be told they won't regret hiring you.      When I step out, two people were waiting for their turn.     A man and a woman. Both probably some years older than me. early thirties maybe.They’re dressed neatly.The kind of clothes people wear when they’re nervous and want to look serious.    The man smiles when he sees me. It’s polite. A little hopeful.    “How did it go?” he asks.     “Good” I say.    He nods quickly. “what did he asked?”    “nothing.just basics.he seemed more interested in how fast you respond tho”    \"fast?\".He laughs.A nervous sound. “Right.”    I smile at him. Not friendly. Not rude.  The woman doesn’t say anything. She just looks at the door, then at me, then back at the door.    After a pause, the man says, “Okay. Best of luck.”    “You too,” i say.   I walk away before he ask anything else.            The next afternoon, the call comes when I’ve just returned to the room after another interview at a different college. Yesterday it was a bigger one. Reputed. I don’t know if they want me. I don’t wait to find out.     Unknown number.  I pick it up anyway..    “Mr. Prabhu? Congratulations. You’ve been selected for the position of Math lecturer at our college.”    A formal voice. She went over the timings.The start date. I listened until she stopped talking. finally the call ended.     I don’t move for a few seconds. Not because it matters. Just because my hand is still holding the phone. I put it down on the table.    The room is quiet again. It’s a small room. One bed pushed against the wall. Thin mattress. The bedsheet is clean but old. It doesn’t fit properly, one corner always slipping off. I stopped fixing it a long time ago. There’s a table near the bed. Cheap wood. A few scratches. On it: my phone, a pen, a notebook, and a file with my documents. I keep the file closed even though I know what’s inside. Habit.    The window is open. Not fully. Just enough for air. From outside, I can hear bikes and a kabadi bhaiya shouting for raddi-paper. Normal sounds. I don’t look out.     I take off my shoes and place them near the wall. Parallel. I don’t remember when I started doing that. I just do.    My bag is on the floor. Half-open. Books inside. Mathematics. Old notes. Some pages folded, some clean. I don’t mind the disorder inside the bag. As long as the room itself stays the same. I boil water using the kettle. It makes a sound like it’s struggling. I wait. While waiting, I count the money in my wallet. Not because I need to. Just checking. Enough for rent. Enough for food. Enough.    The water boils. I pour it into a cup with two wiwi nooddles.Close the lid. four minutes.    While waiting, I sit on the bed. The mattress sinks slightly under my weight. The ceiling has a dark patch near the corner. I’ve seen it grow slowly over months. I don’t know if it’s damp or something else. I don’t ask the owner.    The noodles are ready. I eat standing up. It’s faster that way. The taste is the same as always. I don’t think about it. Food is food.   My phone lights up. A message from the college. Confirmation. Same details as the call. I read it once. Then lock the screen. I should feel something. People usually do. New job. New place. Fresh start. I’ve heard these words before. They don’t stick.    I wash the cup and place it upside down to dry. Wipe the table even though it’s already clean. Small routines keep things in place.I open the file and check the documents again. Certificates. CV. Experience letter. The fake one is there too. Printed properly. Signed properly. Looks real because it doesn’t try too hard.I read one line and then stop. No point rereading things that won’t change. I fold tomorrow’s clothes and place them on the chair. Shirt. Pants. Nothing fancy. I don’t like clothes that stand out. They make people look twice.    I set the alarm. Early enough. Not too early. For a moment, I stand near the window. I don’t lean out. Just stand there. A group of boys pass below, laughing, pushing each other. Probably students. Their voices fade quickly. I don’t follow them with my eyes.    I turn off the light and lie down.The room doesn’t feel heavy. It doesn’t feel light either. It just exists. Like me.    Tomorrow will start like any other day. I’ll go. I’ll teach. I’ll leave when it’s time.    I stare at the ceiling until my eyes adjust to the dark.",

A bit too deliberate in the ends of some paragraphs but otherwise okay. It would be best with a quick proofread and a bit more flexibility with the words. All in all, very good.   Now take it with a pinch of salt because the only knowledge i know about novels is my experience reading them|||hi everyone . i'm trying to write a small novel . its just a chapter one . just wanted to get some suggestion or feedback from people. i don't know  how do  i ask this without sounding weird to people . so i just post the first chapter here.|||Your writing in conversation is very solid. There's always room for improvement, but the first half, where the main character and the principal are talking seems natural.  Where i think you could help with improvement is in writing the interaction with the environment. It needs some noise... In places like phone ringing, water heating, and the motorbike... It makes the words visual. Other than that, I noticed that the main character does organize the shoe, and wipes the already clean countertop, at the same time, leaving the bag half open on the floor. Is this difference in organization intentional?  Also the character is trying too hard to justify being... Uncaring? A person that is that caring wouldn't probably be talking about how (example) food is just food... Now this is your story, so you are the judge of it... But if I was writing this character with an obsessive personality, I would use a lot more show than tell strategy... Like instead of telling the viewers that this character is uncaring in the first chapter... I would probably show the character just eating the same food everyday even though the financial situation changed. So it's my opinion that second part of the chapter could do with some mindmap.  However, as I said earlier, it's your story, so you're the best judge of how to take it forward... It seems promising, looking forward to more chapters.|||This is well-written and very controlled. i would like to read more if you continue this.|||Liked it so far! Needs a little bit of editing in terms of grammar, sentence structure and punctuations. I love how you described little things without making it too boring or lengthy. As a reader it helped me to visualize the surrounding and also interactions. Good luck!!   Would you mind me asking what will be the book about? Right now I'm getting slice of life vibe but this is only the first chapter so not a right judgement on my part probably. No need to answer this though.|||would love to read other chapters!!|||kasto majja aayo!! would love to know how mr prabhu's first day at the school went. genuinely loved The Paper Teacher",

Not too late. They teach everything from basics and you get lectures videos too from app if you miss your class and pdfs too. If you join now you will have to see old lectures since class started about 1 month ago. Not too late to begin you can of course do it if you try.|||Hi, i was an cee aspirant too.

Just a group of students trying to do something real.  Most tech communities here focus only on coding or only on CS students. But that never felt right to us. In real life, growth doesn’t happen in silos. So CodeYatraNP is for any student — science, commerce, bio, CS, A-levels, +2 — anyone who actually cares about building themselves.  We do things like: learning tech & AI in a very practical way workshops & small events outdoor learning & exposure community projects (including working with kids and under-resourced students) helping students collaborate, not compe  And honestly, that’s what CodeYatraNP is about: giving students the exposure we wish we had earlier. No pressure. No fake motivation posts. No “hustle culture”.   If you want to:  meet people who actually build things work on real-world ideas contribute, learn, or even just observe quietly  You’re welcome.  You can check it out or join here:  Even if you don’t join, I’d love to hear thoughts from others who’ve tried building communities like this. We’re learning as we go.  Thanks for reading 🤍",

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations. Oli had smothered our relation with India and that needs fixing too. We've seen with Ukraine what happens when populist politics and bad relation with neighbor does to a country.

But looking at the scenario right now, Balen really holds huge power.  I was just going through the news, and today alone he has been meeting with all kinds of groups. He met Rabi Lamichhane again, he’s in discussions with Kulman Ghising, the Gen Z Group, Baburam Bhattarai, and some people from Congress. He’s been busy all day, even till late evening, I saw updates that he was meeting with Kulman, and he had another meeting scheduled with Rabi that was postponed to tomorrow due to timing issues.  Everyone, be it Rabi or Kulman, seems to understand that Balen must be taken into account. That’s why the main focus has been on him. No alternative force can move forward without Balen at this point.  I originally thought he wouldn’t contest the upcoming election and would instead support someone else, continuing as mayor. But looking at the news now, he has officially announced that he’s entering politics. He has asked everyone to come forward and join him. I also read that Kulman and Balen are on the same page, but talks with Rabi haven’t been finalized. He mentioned that if discussions don’t go smoothly with either Ujjyalo Party of Kulman or RSP of Rabi, he would move forward with his own party, which is already set up.  Man, the amount of power this guy holds right now is insane. We saw it during the protests as well, on the second day, literally the entire country was chanting for Balen to step up and take the prime minister’s seat.  Even now, the news is all about him, everyone seems to be saying Balen must be taken seriously. Crazy times.",

I like Balen dai a lot, but he should remember that he won only 38% (60K Votes) of the votes in the mayor election in Kathmandu while the RSP got around 11% of the NATIONAL vote (11 Lakhs!!!). Currently, the RSP has a wayyyyy bigger mandate to lead the country than Balen or any other alternative force. I hope Kulman dai and Balen dai understand this. I am not going to include Harka dai in this because he seems off the rails.  It's so sad to see alternative parties bickering over who gets power even after the carnage of september 8. If we go into the elections divided, the old establishment will come back to power and will prosecute everyone that was involved in the peaceful protests. Jay Nepal|||People might hate him but one thing is sure if Balen participates actively in election alone or in coalition, he will get almost all the youth votes except who are actively involved in party politics. |||He holds big power because general people think that a country is run by one person and he would magically solve all the problems and people treat him like a god. If people could they would give him unchecked power and make him a dictator and tell other people the beauty of democracy.   Even if the election were to happen then the majority would vote for the same parties and hope for a different outcome. They would be the first to complain that nothing would change in this country and all are bhedas.|||I don’t doubt the intentions of either Balen or Ravi but I think they including their fans and followers have descended into Olipath just as much. Unpopular opinion but Balen and Ravi both are no different than Oli (they could easily become like Oli or worse pretty soon).  Having said that, I too am tempted by the idea of the new and the ‘alternatives’ coming together but I find it very hard to believe that this will lead to anything more than an instant gratification for many Nepalis. I am genuinely scared at the power Balen supposedly holds right now, and I would rather have him explain and clarify his stance as to critical political agendas than hurrying to ride on that power.|||can’t say he is yet to be tested in elections; social media hype and election- entirely different things|||Balen needs to risk it all in the ultimate act of political gamble. Go against KP oli in jhapa. This will be the final symbolic victory over the incumbents.|||Alternative patti janey ho bhaney balen first RSP last|||Yes Balen holds huge power right now but is that only the perception or reality?? He's Mayor of KMC which is huge but KMC doesn't represent all of Nepal and it is not easy to run a political party in Nepal like you have to be hyper active and not be insulated. So I wonder if Balen decides to go it alone and join this Desh bikash party and fight election either on his own or at least ally with Kulman,'s party, what will be the result of that??   I think it will help Balen a lot if he joins RSP and becomes their PM candidate like Ghanti at this point is a well known election symbol, Balen can leave party management to Rabi and maybe Kulman (if he joins) and solely focus on winning his constituency and then planning on what he will do once he becomes PM. Alternatively, he can do alliance with RSP whereby he and some of his people will run on lauro election symbol but then RSP won't field candidates in areas where they run. Desh bikash party may get 10 to 15 seats or more and RSP can support Balen there. Of course in this situation Balen also has to manage a party with lots of different people.   So let's see what happens.|||He holds this immense power because he is the only person that has got this gut to change the future of Nepal at this point! And he has shown that he can maintain and enforce change as he did by being a Mayor alone. Change will take time but a confident and visionary leader must lead our country for some years for now  otherwise our country might stuck being 3rd world forever. I definitely believe he can change a lot of things and if all the right people like kulman and others come along to support him, our nation’s going to be great again.|||I think it only in these major cities only hou|||Dude must be thinking, kabhi kabhi toh lagta hai apun ich vagwaan hai...😆😆.

            "body": "I don’t think Nepal will do much with them either. Rabi is extremely populist—*employment for all in 100 days* and all that. Kulman is similar, with a communist mindset - *free electricity after 10 years* and so on. Yes, many privately owned hydropower projects are going to be nationalized under the BOOT model, but free electricity? Really? Why would elites need free electricity? Does no one have the idea of using that money to create a fund for social security like Norway did?  A wave of populism leads nowhere. We saw that with Prachanda’s Maoists, we saw that with Oli, and now we might witness the same fate again.  People in Nepal hate capitalism, people hate FDI, but at the same time they want the country to be like Norway lol. They need to see how Norway utilized its resources, invited FDI to and created a trillion-dollar fund that backs social security. Without creating capital, nothing is possible. There is no one in Nepal doing politics by explaining this reality—not Rabi, not Balen, not Harka. Kulman is literally a communist.  Nepal’s general mindset needs to be reset, and we need a strong political figure to do that. Rabi, Kulman, and Balen *can* do that, I honestly think so. Nepal is a country where if FDI comes in, people start saying \"desh bechyo\". With this communist mindset, the country is not going anywhere, no country ever has, nor will. Even China had to open its markets to progress. Deng Xiaoping took a step forward to reset the mindset; he said, *“To be rich is glorious.”* We need leaders who can make people understand this. In Nepal, if someone becomes rich, they get abused. Politics needs to be grounded in reality. Free schools, cheap housing, free healthcare all sound cool, but Nepal is a country running a current-account deficit.  Even youth don't understand this reality, leave alone the older generation. All we want is free stuffs but have no damn idea where'll that come from. So we need political figures whom society trusts to explain this. Right now, that’s Rabi, Balen, and Kulman.  So yeah, you can be as excited as you want, but economically Nepal isn’t going anywhere with this mindset.  I want RSP balen kulman to come together and win, not because I’m optimistic about them (yet), but because I want the arrogance of the old parties to die. I want them to lose badly. And I’ll truly support RSP–Balen–Kulman when they start talking about an economic reset.",

This wave of daleytantra is based more on the corrupt bureaucracy than the political class.|||Kulman ghising didn't said he will give free electricity. He said it can be done if we have enough will power. Nepal still need big hydro project to fulfil the demand.  As someone who has worked in energy sector for such a long time, he means he is optimistic. That's his target. The energy he thinks Nepal can produce.   Kulman Ghising has shown great maturity. He barely speak against anyone.  He has never single handedly taken credit for the end of loadshedding. A communist mindset won't do that.   He has shown great managerial skill.  He dedicated trunk line for the industries. He cut the expenses. He sold the excess energy to neighbours. Voila, for the first time in history NEA turns profitable. They are investing in many hydro project without the help of foreign aid. How amazing that sound. That 's not the communist mindset.  He has shown great leadership skill. A leader must decide. People are afraid to decide. They do not want to be in bad page. A leading person must do what is necessary. He should not be scared of criticism. A leader is action oriented.  MCC was needed. He supported it. Parliament approved it. He cut the lines of 30 industries that were not paying bills. He even went against PM. Now they will be paying in 28 installments. He knows how to be strict. And knows how to sort it out.  He knows how beurocracy work.  For Rabi and Balen, it will take time to understand the system. Kulman Ghising came out from that system. Beurocracy can't fool him. He knows the procedure, mindset, the people. He cancelled hundreds of bad contracts.  He himself is working 16/18 hours a day. Kulman Ghising is the best choice.  There are many countries with free health, free school, free housing, free transport etc. Even UK has it. Is UK a communist country.  No, They are socialist.  Do you know Free school education single handedly raised the number of students in Nepal. Free tiffin, books, bicycle for girls. These are the scheme that Nepal government launched successfully. Otherwise poor families weren't sending their kids.  Do you know how many lives governmental hospital is saving. Entire saving is gone in treatment. How is poor supposed to pay. Thanks to government hospitals.  Free is not always bad. People need it. It means a lot for poor people.|||Leader should come with \"nation first \" mindset..

So you’re telling me, we generate all sorts of income from hydropower and give it away to people as subsidies or SS fund?   What will the fund do? What will it go to? In a short run, that could work out but it won’t last forever as we all know.   Nepal can only be revived with a clear mindset and a strategic plan to take the responsibility of every consequence that occurs, be accountable, be aware, with honesty, dignity, a mindset reset (THAT’S BIGG, like you mentioned), honesty is a big part, investments, help from our neighboring countries, and with a commitment to build this nation on the ground it was formed.   Let’s not forget what this nation was and what it’s meant to be. It’s meant to  be the greatest and will be. We got this. Jay Nepal, Jay Himal, Jay Pahad, Jay Terai 🙏  And your mention on topics like Balen and Rabi are capable of bringing this nation back but when you get into the depth of the abyss, you find out that these people didn’t come in the times of scarcity, times when people were lost in the dark stage of destruction that happened in September. My only question is, “Why give away the responsibility to people who never really backed up this revolutionary plan ?”.   Your mention of Kulman doesn’t click in all the way but Kulam seems to have a strong stance on the succession of the MCC plan.|||You seem young and still learning, but wealth creation has nothing to do with capitalism or communism. It can be created in either system.   Nepal does not have oil fields like Norway to get rich quick also the Norwegian creating a common sovereign wealth fund that everyone owns is antithesis of capitalism.   A health mix where capitalism is kept on a short leash is likely the best path forward, if not we will have a bunch of madwari and politician get richer than god while the country remains in doldrums.  There is nothing wrong with what Kulman or Ravi's statement. NEA is there to provide service to Nepali people, It's not there to squeeze every single rupee out of 'customers', it already provides free electricity to low usage household, If it can sustainably lower household electricity bill, what's the harm in that?  I hope you will keep learning and grow out of redscare propaganda.|||Norway also Nationalizes Hydropower after 60 years .

            "body": "I want to share something that happened today. As we all know, pickpocketing is extremely common on public transportation. If you’re a regular public transport user, chances are you’ve witnessed it at least once. I’ve been using public buses for a long time, so I’ve seen this pattern many times.  Usually, these people come in groups. They act like they’re all friends, sit close to each other, talk loudly, and keep changing seats.  The same thing happened today. I was on a bus (Mayur Yatayat), when a group of four or five guys got on. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but you could immediately feel that something was off. They sat near each other, kept talking, and kept switching seats, one moment here, the next moment somewhere else. That alone raised red flags.  What made it very clear was what happened near the Tinkune area. A group of passengers, they were from Terai region, got on the bus. As soon as they entered, one of these guys said, “naya manche chadyo, manche chadyo.” Immediately, one of them stood up, and the group moved close to the new passengers as if they were trying to get past them.  One of the passengers then said he felt someone’s hand inside his jacket pocket, trying to take his phone. A confrontation happened. They couldn't speak clear Nepali but you could easily understand them saying that they were pickpocketers. Immediately after that the group got off bus, as if nothing happened, ultei attitude ka sath.  What was even more frustrating was that another passenger (who was at the last seat) came forward and told the driver and conductor that he had seen these same people many times on this same route. According to him, they usually get on at Gausala and get off around Koteshwor. He said the drivers, conductors, and even the police knows about them, but nothing is done.  This is something I’ve been witnessing since I was a kid. These groups often create distractions, sometimes even fake fights, to divert attention. I still remember an incident from around 12/13 years ago when a group acted like they were fighting, and during that moment, a woman shouted that someone tried to pull the ring off her finger.  What made today even more depressing was that The driver as well as the conductor knew about these people. The guys later confronted the conductor asking him questions like: what about safety of passengers? Why do you let them get on despite of knowing who they are? And the conductor just hussed them off.  Even cops knows all this. We only hear about arrests during their Dashain operations, natra barsa bhari matlab gardeina police le pani.  Some might say, “Why didn’t you confront them?” By the time it became clear, they were already leaving. One of them was drunk, they were all huge and kept cursing, were aggressive, were in group. Getting into a physical fight with them isn’t realistic or safe. Yes record chai garna sakinthyo, but tyo bela dimag chalena.  This problem is way too common, and yet nothing changes. So in the end, we have to be responsible for our own safety. Because as the other guy said, groups like these are regular and he can even recognise them at this point.  If you’re a regular public transport user in Kathmandu, please stay alert and be careful.",

            "body": "Ever since Balen became the mayor of Kathmandu, he has almost completely stopped giving interviews. Before the election, if you remember, he was everywhere. He gave interviews to newspapers, radio, television, and YouTube channels. I even saw him on YouTube channels with very few subscribers. He was deeply invested in PR back then, going everywhere to make his presence felt. He also visited different local areas regularly, and the media coverage at the time was all about Balen.  During those interviews, I clearly remember him saying that he would not be like Bidhya Sundar Shakya, who stayed silent and did not connect with the public. He promised that he would stay connected with people and communicate openly.  But ever since he became mayor, he has practically stopped talking to the press. He has not held proper press conferences or given interviews. Later, there was talk about KMC starting its own TV channel and a program called Public with the Mayo*r*, where citizens could directly connect with him and have their concerns addressed. I believe budget was even allocated for this. But that never happened.  Since then, he has not really answered questions from the press or the public. The same person who promised constant communication has not given a single proper interview during his tenure.  Now, to be clear, I am a supporter of Balen. I do not know why people get offended and start shouting Jhole whenever this topic comes up. Supporting someone does not mean blindly agreeing with everything they do. Criticism is necessary.  When it comes to accountability, facing the media, and answering questions from the public, I honestly give him negative marks. In many other areas, he has done well. But in this aspect, he has done poorly.  Now that he is being considered as a prime ministerial candidate, reportedly by RSP, things become serious. He will have to face the public and the press again. After years of silence, it will be interesting to see how he handles it. What narrative will he push? How will he answer difficult questions?  From what we are hearing, he already has a PR team lined up. But this time, it will not be easy. He will be asked tough questions, and I think his disappearance from public communication after taking office will come up repeatedly.  The election is right around the corner. There are barely around sixty days left. So let’s see how he handles PR this time, how he answers the press, and how he presents himself to the public again.  Let’s see how it goes.",

A balance has to be established!  If we analyze an average Nepali media consumer, you have seen him appear in the headlines either positive or negative - mostly later. The negatives are what's highlighted in the media because that is what people are interested in, that is what people look for - in a way it's how most people are wired. We focus on the negatives, and over look the positives because psychologically we place ourselves above them; we like the feeling of being morally superior to them - mainly people in power like Balen Shah. (If you're thinking how is this relevant, please continue reading) Thus, when you watch it from a PR perspective, it makes sense and justifies why Balen opted not to voluntarily appear in interviews.  BUT HE IS A POLITICAL CANDIDATE RUNNING A STATE/COUNTRY, HE SHOULD ANSWER THE PEOPLE WHO MADE HIM THE ONE IN POWER!! - well yes and no. It depends on what you're trying to get from him, if you want to hyperfixate on the mistakes he makes and villanize them (objectively he isn't answerable to you) if you are looking for genuine answers and willing to give him constructive criticism + a genuine feedback (yes, he is VERY answerable) Now, the problem lies in this YES: how do you determine the difference? And that is what Balen needs to learn!  He has to learn the perfect balance where he is answering the people genuinely concerned and who care about the country and filter out the voices who want him to fall. He has to STOP being a keyboard warrior (for the lack of a better term) and face the mass.  We need to stop politician's idolatry! THEY ARE HUMANS, THEY MAKE MISTAKES... the IMPORTANT part is what they do after they've made a mistake!  Finally, I hope our country heals.

Kathmandu is about 27 degrees N, Delhi is 28 degrees N. Checks out but it's almost at the same latitude in the map.  2.

Mt everest is 27.9881 N and Nepalgunj is about 28.1000 N that is 0.1119 Degrees different. 1 degree is about 111km so if they were on a straight line longitudinally, that would be about 12.43 km north from mt Everest.

Basically, Nepal ma teacher ko ramro perception xaina.|||I share your thought, and I believe most of us have noticed this prejudice. In my opinion, it is mainly because in the context of Nepal, most people choose the teaching profession as a last option to escape unemployment. It is mostly chosen when every other door is closed. I also think it has to do with accessibility too! For example, if you want to be a doctor or engineer, you have to give a \"tough\" entrance exam. The courses are expensive and \"very difficult.\" The level of difficulty and hard work decides how great or cool your career is in most asian countries. Medical is hard, or engineering is hard, which means those subjects deserve respect and prestige. I mean, medicine and engineering are noble careers; they are our life savers; they treat us, they build homes, roads, and infrastructures for us. So, it is natural to command respect. But we, as a collective, also have to understand that every doctor, engineer, scientist, or public service worker is standing in front of us because of teachers and their guidance. I mean all of those successful people became successful based on their own merit or privileges, but they were guided by teachers.  Tara aba situation yesto bhaisakyo ki dherai manche haru le sabai bato bandha bhako dekhera teaching profession maa aaunu huncha, but not everyone in them is passionate about teaching. They are just doing it for the sake of employment. Bhitrai dekhi ichhya bhayera teaching garne kam nai hununcha tei bhayera ni euta bad reputation bandai gako cha about this profession. Euta four-walled room maa 30 dekhi 50 impressionable children lai padhauna, guidance dina immense knowledge, passion, patience, and dedication chahincha. Ajhai higher level maa padhauna ko laagi, you are literally teaching future doctors or engineers, so teachers must be exceptionally gifted and patient. But in most cases, they themselves don't value the profession because they had some other dreams or because society values other, more technical or vast professions.  But I hope our generation and the next generation realise the importance of a guru as an individual and as a society.|||I think how much society respects you depends on how much money you make. For example, you could be uneducated but rich and people will respect you whereas you could be a PhD but, poor and society will ignore you.|||Because everyone thinks teaching is the last option.. \"aru kei vayena vane padauna painxa \" is the general stereotype.

Arko karan teachers usually don't have any political presence or power unless other professionals.|||But I feel the opposite !!|||I believe the perspective on teachers is gradually shifting. However, I’d argue that the notion of Nepali teachers not meeting the expected standard is partially true.  Furthermore, the entire country’s professional system, for all professions, is fundamentally skewed towards those with resources.  This isn’t something we’ve heard; most Nepalis have witnessed it firsthand.  Another factor contributing to this perception is the students’ experience.  Consider how many times our teachers disciplined us for mistakes. While we may have made mistakes (now, as adults, I think we should’ve been rewarded for making as many as possible and learning from them), the way teachers reacted to our errors doesn’t seem like a positive experience.  I’m certain any of us adults, if we had children, would allow them to study under teachers who treated them with the same kind of discipline.  However, I believe the new generation of teachers, particularly Gen Z, is challenging the traditional narrative of teaching as a profession.|||Even educated ones (Bachelor+, Master +) think that profession as low profile, then it's obvious rest of Nepali from villages and little town think that way naturally.   Its all due to our 'proud' cultural society perception. From little kids to educated ones to Grandparents, we have that same sheep mentality.|||So many teachers themselves don't want to be teachers.

She has also been teaming up with Sagar Dhakal recently. They even posted a video urging young people to come forward and participate.  I checked the news as well as her social media, and she is quite active right now, especially around discussions related to elections. She has been vocal about election reforms, such as allowing Nepalis living abroad to vote from their host countries and making it easier for people in remote areas to vote. She seems to be actively working on these issues, attending meetings and discussions.  So yes, she is active, but I am curious about how exactly she is preparing for the election and which party she plans to represent.  I also read on Onlinekhabar that Balen, Kulman, and Rabi might officially announce their collaboration today after signing some papers.

If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

Server hardware in particular is very expensive here.  Electricity, while cheap, is still expensive compared to many countries. And electricity still isn't completely reliable - you still need to invest significantly to prepare for it.

You gotta be able to cope up with demand which is hardest.   and data center is not just cabling racks.

Also, remind your father that government jobs are not as beneficial as they used to be. No pension, even if they have CIT, so do private jobs, you can allocate more portion since private pay more.  Do multiple job.   The disclaimer: I value freedom of choice without stepping over someone else's freedom. So it might be extreme but this is what I would have done.  Forget your father, if you are just another 'responsibility' to him then release him of this burden. Plan for years, move to Kathmandu IF you don't have to ditch bachelor.

            "body": "I worked at a company in Nepal for 1 year. My gross salary was NPR 25,000 per month, but every month I received only NPR 20,598 after tax deduction and CIT contribution. So roughly NPR 4,000 was deducted every month → 4,000 × 12 = ~48,000 per year After I left the company, they gave me only NPR 57,000 as my total CIT amount. They said “this is all our accountant calculated” and did not provide any payslips, tax statements, or CIT breakdown. My questions: Is it normal/fair for around NPR 4,000 to be deducted monthly from a 25k salary? How does CIT work in Nepal? How much should be employee contribution? How much should be company contribution? Shouldn’t the company also contribute to CIT separately? Should I receive official payslips or CIT statements? Has anyone faced a similar situation? Am I possibly being underpaid or scammed? I’m confused about the accounting rules and would appreciate advice from anyone familiar with Nepal salary tax & CIT system. Thanks in advance 🙏",

Good companies or individuals don’t count your years of experience; they care about what you can actually do.  for example:    I’m hiring an HTML/CSS developer—someone who truly knows HTML and CSS and spends most of their year/life time coding only CSS/HTML. They should know how to fix issues, write clean code, and understand CSS deeply.

So there’s no way this dude can beat deuba in his own hometown. RSP is a party without ideology, I am not supporting other parties but a party without a ideology is a doomed one.

They could never lead, never inspire, never convince anyone of their strength or worth, so they cling to borrowed authority and mistake intimidation for power. Having failed to matter among equals, they settle for bullying children who have no choice, no protection, and no way to fight back against an entire institution stacked in their favor. It takes a special kind of weakness to feel important only when someone else is powerless, and an even smaller kind of courage to call that strength.

I am from Kathmandu and lived here back then, so I didn't have to experience it first hand. But, I had a friend in school who had migrated from Gorkha. His father had been murdered by the Maoists and he was living with his mama in Kathmandu at that point. He was just 8 years old. He didn't even have the full understanding of what it meant, but he was already an orphan.  This man is responsible for all those murders, orphaning, widowing, pain, and suffering, and for what?

From grades 8–10 I took home tuition, but for +2 it’s really expensive, so I want to switch to group tuition at a centre. I’ve also tried online tuition before, but I honestly couldn’t focus well. In a proper class setting, I do much better, so a tuition centre is what I’m looking for.  I’ve looked on Facebook, but all I find are home tutors. I want to know where I can actually look for tuition centres that offer group classes.  Also, for people who have been to such centres before, I wanna ask how much do they usually charge and are the classes held every day or around 2–3 days a week?",

Just a group of students trying to do something real.  Most tech communities here focus only on coding or only on CS students. But that never felt right to us. In real life, growth doesn’t happen in silos. So CodeYatraNP is for any student — science, commerce, bio, CS, A-levels, +2 — anyone who actually cares about building themselves.  We do things like: learning tech & AI in a very practical way workshops & small events outdoor learning & exposure community projects (including working with kids and under-resourced students) helping students collaborate, not compe  And honestly, that’s what CodeYatraNP is about: giving students the exposure we wish we had earlier. No pressure. No fake motivation posts. No “hustle culture”.   If you want to:  meet people who actually build things work on real-world ideas contribute, learn, or even just observe quietly  You’re welcome.  You can check it out or join here:  Even if you don’t join, I’d love to hear thoughts from others who’ve tried building communities like this. We’re learning as we go.  Thanks for reading 🤍",

Next year in 2019,MY FRIEND AND I made our decision to STUDY  STANDARD +2 TEXTBOOK JUST FOR MCQS POINT THROUGHLY - and PRACTICED DAILY THE PREVOIUS PAST PAPERS JUST TO KNOW THE QUESTIONS FORMATS AND REVISED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE result was that I scored 84 out of 100 (highest marks-89) and My friend scored 86 out of 100. He got a seat in KMC with a full scholarship and I got a seat in MCOMS in full scholarship. ALL THE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED FROM THE LINE OF THOSE STANDARD TEXTBOOKS. Now the decision is in your hands. Just stick with one decision which makes you feel better and start early.

These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room. Extreme events were a result of us getting pushed to the extremes after decades of built-up anger, frustration, and fatally shooting our fellow school and college-going citizens by our own government.|||I think OP forgets the fact that on September 8th ... Videos and photos of kids with their brains splattered on the road were on full display... These kids of schools and colleges had no fault other than practising their constitution given right to protest peacefully..  and yet our security system deemed it right to kill these students .. through closed gates.. not one rubber bullet was fired not a single one. And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3.

The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here.

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.

With that said, you have to be careful where you rent. You can get ripped off pretty easy and there is a wild difference in price for rental apartments depending on your location and standards. This is the same for food. etc. You won't need to worry about safety at all in Nepal, it's much safer than anywhere in the west, but you will have to be careful about everyone seeing you as a walking wallet which can be tough but you learn pretty fast. In my opinion the quality of life far exceeds the life in the west, but the learning curve for everything is VERY steep!  I would very seriously suggest just spending a month or two there first to see if it's for you, life in Nepal is 100% opposite from the western world in every way, so it's definitely not for everyone.|||2000 euros will give you a good upper middle-class life. But depends on whether you’re alone vs if you have kids and whether they need to go to a school.|||Price in euros:  Rent for decent 1 person apt - 150 to 350    Good restaurant meal (pizza, pasta) - 7    Local meal (momo, noodles, fried rice) - 1 to 3    Tap beer in restaurant - 5   Bottled beer 650ml in shop - 2.5   Average car taxi ride - 3   Average bike taxi ride - 1.5   Monthly internet, electricity, water - 20   Gas cylinder (can last 4 - 5 months) - 10   Cheapest imported wine in shop (wine is expensive) - 10   Doctor's visit - 5   Meds - quite cheap, less than 5 for flu, etc.  Young Nepalese consider earning more than 100,000 rupees per month (€625) as a very lavish single income.   Social life: People are very approachable if you are a foreigner. You will easily meet fellow europeans, americans etc too who work in international organisations. If you are looking for love, you might find it easily if you are hanging around the right crowd. Nightlife exists in 1 or 2 places, with some clubs/bars opening well beyond midnight.  Kathmandu negatives:   \\- Street dogs can bark all night, so get earplugs to sleep.   \\- Air quality is not great, wear a mask outside and get a air filter inside.   \\- Traffic can get crazy. Best to bicycle around.  Overall:   I have met 100+ westerners in Nepal and none have said they dislike Kathmandu.

And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.

But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||[deleted]|||Sooooo true!! Can confirm (Australia). I just refuse to speak hindi. My blood boils when people i don't know approach me in domineering hindi (ajha sometime ta straight punjabi or gujrati) and i am like WTFFF!!!!! And i hate when people ask me which state i am from. I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||Speak whatever the f you want and don't make it a national issue.

Only know old ones which I was forced to watch with my mom.|||[deleted]|||[removed]|||Absolutely agree! Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason. Have been seeing this for decades now.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents.

I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||I NEVER speak Hindi and never will, I say I can understand but cannot speak Hindi so I reply in English. Don’t let these Indians think they can go around speaking Hindi to every South Asia, it’s time they learn to respect other South Asians.  Also I’m Mongolian so they think I’m Chinese or Filipino when they meet me and talk to me in English but when they find out I’m Nepali they start talking to me in Hindi out of nowhere and treat me VERY different. Hell with these Indians.|||You live in Canada. But the rest of em live in landlocked nepal who get jobs in Hindi speaking regions of india. So they speak it for the job. Like you speak english in canada|||Yep, that’s why I stopped watching, listening and speaking anything that has Hindi in it|||The majority of the population in Mauritius speaks French, does that change their identity? Most of the people in brazil speak Portuguese, does that change their identity? Most of the people in nigeria speaks english, does that change their identity?   Also just to let you know we share almost exactly the same culture, there is no difference.  No one is forcing you to speak hindi, even in india, many people can't even understand a word of it.   No need to hide the hate behind the words like 'our own identity's or ' our culture' or anything else. You directly say you hate indians, why? it's a trend now days to hate indian culture, skin colour, language or anything that comes from india.  You can google how much india has contributed in the development of nepal and also how nepal has contributed to the development of India. You will see the clear difference in how much India has helped  your country, but still if you want to fall for a trend then go on, we won't care cause we won't be affected.|||As an indian myself i try not to speak  in hindi.  The imposition needs to stop in india itself too.   Non native people here in mumbai are trying to erase our marathi language too.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||After reading all the comments I got to know that nepalis hate indians to the core just one bad instinct is enough to rage them against indian.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place.

Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself.

The Koteshwor traffic jam finally started moving, and I was riding slowly when I noticed three people inside the car infront of me were staring and gesturing aggressively at me and fellow vehicles.  ​Then, the high beams flickered from the car behind me. I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this. It is disappointing to see someone enjoy \"special facilities\" while ignoring the basic infrastructure the rest of us struggle with every day. If they want a clear road, they should use our tax money to fix the roads for everyone, not just for their own convoys.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ?

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited. Otherwise the money is returned after deducting some applicable court fees (if any) once the case is closed or a sentence is made.|||Exactly as you said if defendant is not flight risk and not risk to himself or others they can pay bail to wait for court date.

Not Rabi , nor Balen ever said anything negative about working together but the public basically was going crazy why they weren't coming to agreements. Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive. Anyone who can't answer the questions will turn into a dictator sooner or later. Craze will be enough to win the elections, not run the country.",

With that said, you have to be careful where you rent. You can get ripped off pretty easy and there is a wild difference in price for rental apartments depending on your location and standards. This is the same for food. etc. You won't need to worry about safety at all in Nepal, it's much safer than anywhere in the west, but you will have to be careful about everyone seeing you as a walking wallet which can be tough but you learn pretty fast. In my opinion the quality of life far exceeds the life in the west, but the learning curve for everything is VERY steep!  I would very seriously suggest just spending a month or two there first to see if it's for you, life in Nepal is 100% opposite from the western world in every way, so it's definitely not for everyone.|||2000 euros will give you a good upper middle-class life. But depends on whether you’re alone vs if you have kids and whether they need to go to a school.|||Price in euros:  Rent for decent 1 person apt - 150 to 350    Good restaurant meal (pizza, pasta) - 7    Local meal (momo, noodles, fried rice) - 1 to 3    Tap beer in restaurant - 5   Bottled beer 650ml in shop - 2.5   Average car taxi ride - 3   Average bike taxi ride - 1.5   Monthly internet, electricity, water - 20   Gas cylinder (can last 4 - 5 months) - 10   Cheapest imported wine in shop (wine is expensive) - 10   Doctor's visit - 5   Meds - quite cheap, less than 5 for flu, etc.  Young Nepalese consider earning more than 100,000 rupees per month (€625) as a very lavish single income.   Social life: People are very approachable if you are a foreigner. You will easily meet fellow europeans, americans etc too who work in international organisations. If you are looking for love, you might find it easily if you are hanging around the right crowd. Nightlife exists in 1 or 2 places, with some clubs/bars opening well beyond midnight.  Kathmandu negatives:   \\- Street dogs can bark all night, so get earplugs to sleep.   \\- Air quality is not great, wear a mask outside and get a air filter inside.   \\- Traffic can get crazy.

I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it. Or what you think my contribution to X is. Grow up. Literally.|||Bro collecting degree like  he collecting magikarp in pokemon!|||How many degrees you got? 37?|||bro yo budo ko math 11 12 9 10 tira guide math ko ani bachelors tira ni cha   khatra budo ho hau|||And op here struggling with SEE.|||Made math easier to understand for the growing mind so that they dont post ragebait in reddit like this.

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

I am a Hindu living in India. I saw this and was shocked. It's not just about Hindus, he was a human first. No one deserves this. The islamic countries here in Asia are being sponsored by various other countries to spread violence. The islamic crowd needs to understand that they are not made for religion, religion is made for them. Religion is for your inner peace and it does not need anything from the people. Executing people just because they said something against religion is not acceptable. Day by day this harsh mentality of muslims is being carried forward by young generations who don't even know anything about their religion. This needs to stop.

In the protest you guys killed and the burned the politician and beated them on road to death. You guys destroyed public property and also the government property made by your own tax money. Stealing from malls and local shops,  those who were stealing they were all educated people, you guys are corrupt yourself and what better can we expect from government. I saw videos of Indian youths crying in pokhara for help when some group of protesters came to beat them because they were indians. Now I guess after doing all this Nepal will surpass india and germany, china, japan etc right? A politicians wife was burnt alive in her house and she died while going to the hospital.  I am not blaming the people who did nothing like this, and if you didn't then congrats 👏🏻 you hold a special place in my heart. My comment is for those who did these things not for those who didn't.  ![gif](giphy|iNPNqI81MvDQ4D4n6D)  Don't be a fool, I know truth is harsh and you can't accept it.  For some people let me clear that; I belong to a Hindu family but I am an atheist so I can see from logic, I don't support Bangladesh nor what happened in this video. But the irony of the protesters is hilarious.|||It's not muslims the problem but the hanafi, wahabism and Deubandi school of thought which makes them radical. Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction.",

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

But I also hesitate because I’m not sure if they would understand me clearly in English, and I genuinely want to help.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi.

Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies . Most people outside KTM actually hate the protests as they've seen the burning images of government properties.|||It's necessary that they unite and they must too.

Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

Before, I thought ki aile money management or management+tech is a good direction to head towards but was I stupid to think I could get into those fields by joining BBA?  Is it better to just drop out and try for engineering next year?  Edit: I used to get decent grades in +2 sci too. Final ma 3.7 aako ho, did I make a huge huge mistake?",

I'm only trying to name good ones here. These are probably not the most niche Shortfilms and movies out there that I've seen. But all 3 of them are incredible and I'd definitely recommend to everyone. Especially La Jeteé and Meshes of the Afternoon.
