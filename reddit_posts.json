Since quitting, I‚Äôve been feeling super weak at work ‚Äî like I‚Äôve got no power. I can‚Äôt even work properly without drinking Monster now. Before, I never needed it this much, but after quitting weed & cigarettes , I feel like I can‚Äôt go through a shift without it.  Also, I noticed that when I eat something, it tastes normal ‚Äî but when I‚Äôm not eating, my mouth feels weirdly tasteless. Sleep is also hard to get, I keep tossing around.  Still, I do feel a bit fresher overall, like my body is trying to adjust. I used to smoke around 2 grams of weed daily (about 28‚Äì29% THC), which I think is pretty strong.  Has anyone else gone through this kind of weakness or tasteless mouth after quitting? How long did it take before you started feeling normal again?",

            "body": "I had a huge crush on someone during +2. Never confessed, never became partners, just carried it quietly, like so many of us do. She was brilliant. Now she's in the topmost medical college in the country.  I suspected someone might be in her life based on her social media. Approached the guy indirectly through a channel. He didn't give me a straight answer, so I stayed confused for months. Then a mutual friend finally told me the truth. He'd been hiding it for my own mental wellness, but eventually let it slip. And now I'm just‚Ä¶ frozen.‚Äã  I know this sounds ridiculous. How can someone I never dated, never held hands with, never even confessed to... how can that hurt this much? But it does. Maybe it's because I never got closure. Maybe it's because while I stayed far, someone else got close. Or maybe it's because her shadow was the most beautiful thing I'd ever known, and somewhere in my heart, I'd convinced myself she could've been a princess in my story.‚Äã  But she was never mine to lose.‚Äã  And still, the ache sits quietly, like the hum of a tractor long after it's driven away. It reminds me that some distances aren't measured in kilometers, but in the spaces between what could have been and what actually is.‚Äã  So I'm here asking for guidance from the dai/didis who've overcome this kind of affection, attraction, or love. How did you do it? How did you stop replaying memories that never even happened? How did you find the strength to let go of someone who was never yours to hold?‚Äã  Any tips, advice, or just honest words would mean a lot right now.‚Äã",

These people didn't have any relation with the current government, nor were they ever in politics( this was done because Serbian people believe that the opposing parties are also corrupt).  >sounds cool. so, a new political party? I hope they win, they probably will.  man, I'm burned out from Nepali politics. there is a high chance that, there will be more division and more instability. AAAAAA I don't want to think about this. all I know is few people in current interim government are the best that there is. beyond that, I don't have big faith in anyone. countless factions. many opportunists. I don't see the wisdom in many. and the selflessness needed to birth a capable and wise polity. only thing we can hope for is a good political party. and that's uncertain. one thing is for sure, there are more political parties. and more division.  I'm starting to believe that almost all people are incapable of deep reasoning and far from understanding what is needed for a successful government. and in upcoming elections. discourse will be hijacked by demagogues with those shallow stirring speeches. slanders of oppositions. hard to see political culture changing for better. and if individuals are like this. it's much harder to be an impressive unit with cohesion as a government. I don't feel like things will get much better. it really felt very hopeful a month back. let's see what happens in the next elections. it's too messy to predict stuff rn. and we can't do much, I think.|||First of all, I think Serbia is on the right path and I hope the best people will win the election.   Nepal is currently administrated by an interim government which is working to hold an election within the next 5 months. This interim government is doing just fine, not the best. But as the whole system is filled with corrupts, the government hasn't been able to deliver as per the high expectations. However, I think the corruption is almost nil right now because who would dare, right? The ministers we have currently have are definitely the best ones as compared to any of the ministers before. Especially the education minister is doing great imo.   But the main question is, what would happen after the new election. If the thrown out parties came back to power, we are doomed. We do have many leaders who are respected by most and not linked with the old big parties but don't know their exact plan for the election. They must be working on it, but a lot of confusion remains, and rightfully so, because nobody was prepared for this situation. I personally have big hopes and positive vibes for the coming election as people are now more aware about the politics, especially the younger ones.|||I was very positive after the revolution but I‚Äôm worried how things are going now especially with social media/individuals/YouTube putrukar are diverting to unnecessary issues. Everyone is divided and the main culprits behind all these issues are looking for an opportunity to rise again:  - everyone praised people/celebrities for joining the revolution but the same media/individuals are after them now for damaging public property( one media started and now everyone jumped on the bandwagon). I‚Äôm against any form of violence/damaging public property however all nalayak leaders are roaming free giving speech; here the main issue is diverted to unnecessary topic. investigation should be conducted and all the real culprits for damaging public/ individual property should be punished. Now is the time to punish real culprit for their fake hope, promises and looting country. They are responsible for harming our past, present and future generations.   - Fractions on Gen-Z groups: who were together during revolution are now divided and look like they are influenced by external groups who were looking for an opportunity to address their own demands. Obviously all the issues raised during the revolution should be addressed but need to prioritise main issue: stable governance, punishment to nalayaks and reformation to bureaucracy.  - Individuals/ journalists harassing Gen-Z with their questions (which is not bad) but unable to speak in the same way to those nalayak leaders. They should be barking at them then Gen-Z group/individuals.   - Durga prasai: after all the tragedy and destruction,how can he say that he will bring another storm of protest. How can he openly request general public to make stock of food and gas at home. Enough is enough.   -People: Jumping on the bandwagon: same group of individual who attended the revolution are now planning to attend Dura prasai‚Äôs protest. Same group of individual who shared hate speech to their nalayak leaders are now praising again, same group of individuals who appreciated what they did during the revolution are not against them.   We are everywhere. Now, this is the time to be clear what and who we truly support.  . I really appreciate what this government is doing with all the challenges. I‚Äôm still positive that they will work on to make peace and prosperity.  . Based in my personal opinion.|||It was a anger buildup of 30 years of corruption concentrated in 1 day alongisde mass unemployment and that protest was like we scored 1 goal but conceded 5 goals in return. that 1 goal was few politicians got beat up and their houses torched (maybe you should get hints, it just needs a angry crowd) but the 5 goals are lots of weapons were looted (will be used in future civil war), police morale at lowest, lawlessness, a government approved by the \"indo-west\" MCC similar to bangladesh and free tibet (sudan gurung/TOB) has gained momentum to anger china. The current govt is also scared cause pepl know where they live and next time, their houses will be targeted|||Irrelevant but If anyone here is gay/ bi man in Kathmandu hmu.

Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They‚Äôve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôre now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *‚ÄúIndian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.‚Äù* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn‚Äôt India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

When I joined, the CEO (who also interviewed me) mentioned there were about 10 people in the company. In reality, it‚Äôs just the two founders both working full-time elsewhere and two other interns (frontend and UI/UX).  On my very first day, I was given a task, completed it, got it reviewed, and my code was merged that same day. Since then, I‚Äôve been working on similar client projects: mostly small-scale eCommerce sites, matrimony platforms, restaurant/hotel websites, etc.  Here‚Äôs typically what I do for each project:  * Design and model the database * Set up the Django project (using pre-existing templates when available) * Build RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework * Integrate payment systems (Razorpay, Cashfree, etc.) * Implement WebSocket features if required * Document APIs and coordinate with the frontend intern * Assist with AWS deployment  I had prior experience building a single-vendor eCommerce project as a freelancer, so most of these tasks aren‚Äôt new to me. The only real learning I‚Äôve done so far is related to AWS deployment.  What‚Äôs bothering me is how *hands-off* the whole experience is, I rarely get any feedback or discussion around my code quality or architectural decisions. I just complete my tasks, push the code, and move on.  Is this normal for internships at small startups? Should I stick around for the experience on paper, or look for something that offers more mentorship and technical growth?",

Think of farmers in Nepal who wake up every day to a relentless routine.. cutting grass for cattle, cleaning up animal waste to be used as manure, and managing the upkeep of their animals. They deal with the mess, the stress, and the constant demands of their daily tasks like working in the fields under the scorching heat or thundering rain. **They can‚Äôt afford to take a day off or complain about their workload. They simply** ***have*** **to get it done, no matter what.**  Then, there‚Äôs the second group, the ones who have the freedom to question their work, to voice dissatisfaction, and to contemplate changes in their careers or lifestyle. They have the luxury to consider whether they want to take on more responsibility or even leave their jobs if things aren‚Äôt going well. You have choices, even if they feel overwhelming at times but compared to the first group I feel like they're nothing. To me, I see it as comparing a broken leg with a paper cut.  >Now, My answer to you is simple. Do you really want to complain about your job which is paying a lot better if you ask me. I'm earning a measly 20k per month and for someone like me who has given up on joining higher studies because I can't afford it at the moment. I don't know how I should feel about this post in general.  One thing I‚Äôve been wondering is, for people like me who are still figuring things out and haven‚Äôt quite reached that level yet, how do you actually get to a point where you‚Äôre earning lakhs every month? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not putting in effort, but I feel like there‚Äôs something more, some approach or mindset.. that I might be missing. How did you make that leap?

If you find it easy to the point of boredom, that indicates you've likely mastered it and can execute tasks with efficiency and ease. This doesn't imply that design is a subpar field; rather, it‚Äôs a sign that you're performing at a high level.  Even if you‚Äôve accumulated a decent financial cushion, I would recommend against leaving your current job just yet. Stability is crucial, and a well structured career progression is built over time.  I also suggest leveraging your current workplace environment to foster meaningful connections. If you have strong interpersonal skills, it‚Äôs important to engage with your colleagues. Especially those in HR or senior roles. You might want to ask for guidance or inquire about participating in high visibility projects. Avoid disengaging from your current responsibilities, but if you're completing tasks efficiently, use any extra time to network or learn from senior developers, particularly in backend, to diversify your skill set as mentioned in your post.  In Conclusion, your post doesn't give us the entire picture and definetly doesn't explain what type of person you are in general to be able to answer your question with confidence.

And I kept handing you the pieces of me like a test you didn‚Äôt know you were taking. You kept passing it anyway.  You were steady. Soft in ways that made me suspicious.  I kept waiting for the catch  the part where love turns into leaving. So I left first. Not in steps, but in small ways that looked like forgetting. Forgetting to listen. Forgetting to stay. Forgetting that you were trying.  I said I needed space, but I really needed saving. And you tried. God, you tried.  You held me like someone praying for a miracle  that didn‚Äôt believe in itself.  I was cold to you. You called it distance.  But it was fear.  Fear of being seen and found wanting. Fear of how good you were.  Fear that your love might actually heal me and I wouldn‚Äôt know who I was without the ache.   I made you doubt the simplest things.  Your laughter. Your worth. Your quiet faith.  You started apologizing for the things I broke,  and I let you. That‚Äôs the part that still haunts me   that I watched you carry my damage  like it was something you owed me.  If you saw me now,  you wouldn‚Äôt recognize the silence I live with.  It‚Äôs shaped like your name. It hums in the background of everything good I find,  reminding me who taught me what love should have been.   I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt learn it in time.  I‚Äôm sorry for the nights you fell asleep thinking you weren‚Äôt enough.  You were. You were everything steady and good and real. I was just too lost to see it.  If I could stand in front of you now,  I wouldn‚Äôt ask for another chance.  I‚Äôd just say your name  like it‚Äôs something holy, and tell you that I finally understand.   That you were never asking for perfection   you were asking for presence. And I kept mistaking leaving for strength.  So this is me, years too late, still loving you quietly in the places I never let you reach. Still whispering sorry  to a memory that deserves peace.  Because you were home. And I was the one who locked the door.",

You were never just a person to me. You were a season I wasn‚Äôt ready for warm after too many winters. And I ruined it by expecting the snow to come back.  I said things I didn‚Äôt mean. I said nothing when I should have begged you to stay. And now the quiet I built to keep you out has become the house I can‚Äôt leave.  When Lana Del Rey said, ‚ÄúDear Lord, when I get to heaven, please let me bring my man,‚Äù I thought, that‚Äôs me. Because what is heaven if the one person who made earth bearable isn‚Äôt waiting at the gate?  If I make it there, I won‚Äôt ask for light or wings or mercy. I‚Äôll just ask to see you once more, to tell you I‚Äôm sorry for every time I mistook your kindness for naivety, for every time I flinched from the hand that only wanted to hold me steady.  You loved me like sunrise, and I hid from it with both hands over my eyes. I told myself it was safer in the dark. Now I know the dark was only grief waiting for a name.  If you saw me now, you‚Äôd see someone quieter, someone who finally learned that love doesn‚Äôt disappear when it ends; it settles, like dust on everything you touch.  And if heaven ever lets me find you, I‚Äôll walk right up to you and whisper, You were the miracle I didn‚Äôt recognize. Then I‚Äôll thank you for loving me when I was all fear and splinters, and for teaching me that gentle doesn‚Äôt mean weak.  Dear Lord, when I get to heaven, please let me bring my man. Not so I can keep him, but so I can finally look him in the eyes without all this trembling and say the words I never managed to give him here   I‚Äôm sorry. And thank you. And I love you still.",

            "body": "So, I recently participated in a Model United Nations (MUN) and won the Best Delegate award. It was an inter-college event small-scale, but still a great experience. But ever since then, a question has been spinning in my head i.e. After doing 1 MUN, or even 30 of them what‚Äôs the actual end goal? I mean, yes MUNs improve public speaking, diplomacy, confidence, and critical thinking. But what‚Äôs the bigger picture? Some people go for youth delegate programs, some aim for international MUNs, but how does one really get there? Like, what‚Äôs the path? If I win more awards, sure, it adds to my portfolio. But at the end of the day, isn‚Äôt it still all at a college or small-scale level? How can someone make a national-level impact or build a reputation beyond local MUN circles? And there‚Äôs another side to this the cost. Most MUNs charge around Rs. 3,000‚Äì5,000 for just 2‚Äì3 days. Paying that multiple times really adds up. So is doing 10, 20, or even 40 MUNs really worth it financially or professionally? Like does it ever actually lead to something bigger, like representing youth internationally or joining real diplomatic forums? Or is it more of an extracurricular activity that ends once college does? Would love to hear from people who‚Äôve been deep into the MUN world what did you get out of it long-term?",

Try to answer all 1 mark questions correctly otheriwse A+ aaudaina. Then in 4 mark qn, I wrote 2 lines of introduction (definition) then I skipped a line and wrote \"The related points are below\" I wrote 6 points then concluded in 2 lines. That should cover 75% of the page. Start every 4 and 7 mark QN from a new page. In 7 mark qn, I wrote around a para of introduction then 12 points then a paragraph of conclusion.   3. In Nepali, get all the grammar correct and try to maintain the answer sheet clean. Decent length ans will get you an A+   4. Maths ra Opt maths ma ta tei practice gare pugi halxa.

Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy.

My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I‚Äôm mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed ‚Äî personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I‚Äôve finally come out the other side.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs being there for someone who‚Äôs lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.

This shows how far our moral compass has fallen.

Do you people even realize that words can scar someone for life? That trauma does not disappear once the trend fades?  If you truly cared about justice or character, you would have spoken against this toxic behavior, not encouraged it. And to those public figures who stay silent or worse, enjoy it, you are part of the problem.  Sandeep, if your heart was truly pure, you would have intervened long ago. You could have told your followers to stop this bullying and personal attack. But your silence speaks volumes. A good heart does not take pleasure in someone else‚Äôs humiliation.  Today fans may be cheering for you. Tomorrow the same crowd can turn just like they did with others. Fame built on hate will always collapse on itself.  We desperately need social media ethics and intervention in Nepal. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to destroy someone‚Äôs dignity. It is time to rebuild our moral spine and remember that civilization starts with how we treat others, especially when no one is watching.",

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it‚Äôs 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I‚Äôm happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He‚Äôs an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn‚Äôt benefit from it.  My father isn‚Äôt happy here  It‚Äôs been over 10 years and he‚Äôd say that if I said I wanna go back he‚Äôll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) ‚ÄúTell your father this. ‚ÄòDad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?‚Äô If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He‚Äôs here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him ‚Äîjust him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn‚Äôt want to leave his family here‚Äù  I then said ‚Äúdad‚Äôs gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That‚Äôs what he said‚Äù  Grandma ‚Äúhe said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you‚Äôre always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn‚Äù   Me ‚Äúbut, I like it here‚Äù  Grandma  ‚ÄúDo you love your dad or not? He‚Äôs done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He‚Äôs 53 now. Come to Nepal. I‚Äôve got money to pay for your school fees‚Äù  That‚Äôs when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it‚Äôs especially hard in the hot son as he‚Äôs an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn‚Äôt like it heere and he‚Äôs much happier everytime we‚Äôre in Nepal.  My dad did say ‚Äúwe should‚Äôve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick‚Äù But I‚Äôm 23 now  And I don‚Äôt wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He‚Äôs an amazing person who‚Äôs gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say ‚ÄúI want to go back to Nepal‚Äù he‚Äôll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the ‚Äúpower‚Äù but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here‚Äôs what she said ‚ÄúYour dad is 50 now. He‚Äôs been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don‚Äôt let me stop you but if I was in your place, I‚Äôd come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors‚Äù  I hate it.

Both of my parents are pushing 50 and want to go back to Nepal and take me with them, but I've chosen to live here and let them go back to Nepal when my little brother is grown up. The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.  Another reason for you to not go back if your gender. You have more rights and freedoms in Australia than you do in Nepal, and you might not get used to the regressive expectations that native Nepalis have for women.|||No offense, but it seems like she's engaging in some extremely manipulative behavior.   P.S. I don't know the whole story. This is just the feeling I got from reading this post. I might be completely wrong.|||You father will not want to destroy your life and career and come to Nepal. Stay there make a good living come back 10 yrs later retire early.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.|||Don‚Äôt feel anything bad about yourself. Its his decision and not yours.   Years ago he was coerced by your mom and now your grandma wants you to coerce him back to Nepal. I don‚Äôt know what it is with the ladies of your household but I think he has to make his own decision   Every parent makes  sacrifices and if you become one you will too. And what if father you go back what about your brother ? It is what it is . If he wanted to leave he should have done years ago. Complete your studies first and than think what you should do? And don‚Äôt feel guilty about anything, this situation isn‚Äôt of your making and you shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice your studies or career for this. Your father will never be able to forgive himself.|||It is hard to deal with manipulation from adult family as we get older. As children our adult family are our guides and heroes. When we grow we start to learn they are flawed people just like everyone. But learning to handle their manipulation will make you stronger. You are an adult now and allowed to make decisions about your own life and how you live it   Maybe you can find some way to help your father enjoy Australia more? Is he involved with the nepali community? Maybe he can do a hobby or a sport? Enjoy some day trips on the weekend to parks or gardens|||Don't let your dad's sacrifice go to vain. He endured to give you the opportunity, don't let it go to waste.|||Hi, I cant provide the solution. But I am an engineer and currently living in Australia. Can you ask your dad to provide job refrence to me please. That will mean alot to me. Thankyou|||Never needed to post this as your grandmother and cousin said it best but if you really want to make your happy, convince your mother to consider her husband‚Äôs happiness too as you said he‚Äôs not happy and you should complete your studies. Consult with your family about each others needs but for you tell them that you are considering to go back to Nepal temporarily but will return as even after completing studies you won‚Äôt get better job opportunities in Nepal and even then you‚Äôll visit your family.

Partly, our people were jealous of how you handled your corrupt politicians, but partly, I wonder if the situation in your country will get better now. I am guessing there are a lot of opportunists who now want to take the place of the old government. Are you in any kind of way preventing them from that?  In Serbia, students have created a list of people who will be participating in the next elections(representing students). These people didn't have any relation with the current government, nor were they ever in politics( this was done because Serbian people believe that the opposing parties are also corrupt).",

I hope they win, they probably will.  man, I'm burned out from Nepali politics. there is a high chance that, there will be more division and more instability. AAAAAA I don't want to think about this. all I know is few people in current interim government are the best that there is. beyond that, I don't have big faith in anyone. countless factions. many opportunists. I don't see the wisdom in many. and the selflessness needed to birth a capable and wise polity. only thing we can hope for is a good political party. and that's uncertain. one thing is for sure, there are more political parties. and more division.  I'm starting to believe that almost all people are incapable of deep reasoning and far from understanding what is needed for a successful government. and in upcoming elections. discourse will be hijacked by demagogues with those shallow stirring speeches. slanders of oppositions. hard to see political culture changing for better. and if individuals are like this. it's much harder to be an impressive unit with cohesion as a government. I don't feel like things will get much better. it really felt very hopeful a month back. let's see what happens in the next elections. it's too messy to predict stuff rn. and we can't do much, I think.|||First of all, I think Serbia is on the right path and I hope the best people will win the election.   Nepal is currently administrated by an interim government which is working to hold an election within the next 5 months. This interim government is doing just fine, not the best. But as the whole system is filled with corrupts, the government hasn't been able to deliver as per the high expectations. However, I think the corruption is almost nil right now because who would dare, right? The ministers we have currently have are definitely the best ones as compared to any of the ministers before. Especially the education minister is doing great imo.   But the main question is, what would happen after the new election. If the thrown out parties came back to power, we are doomed. We do have many leaders who are respected by most and not linked with the old big parties but don't know their exact plan for the election. They must be working on it, but a lot of confusion remains, and rightfully so, because nobody was prepared for this situation. I personally have big hopes and positive vibes for the coming election as people are now more aware about the politics, especially the younger ones.|||I was very positive after the revolution but I‚Äôm worried how things are going now especially with social media/individuals/YouTube putrukar are diverting to unnecessary issues. Everyone is divided and the main culprits behind all these issues are looking for an opportunity to rise again:  - everyone praised people/celebrities for joining the revolution but the same media/individuals are after them now for damaging public property( one media started and now everyone jumped on the bandwagon). I‚Äôm against any form of violence/damaging public property however all nalayak leaders are roaming free giving speech; here the main issue is diverted to unnecessary topic. investigation should be conducted and all the real culprits for damaging public/ individual property should be punished. Now is the time to punish real culprit for their fake hope, promises and looting country. They are responsible for harming our past, present and future generations.   - Fractions on Gen-Z groups: who were together during revolution are now divided and look like they are influenced by external groups who were looking for an opportunity to address their own demands. Obviously all the issues raised during the revolution should be addressed but need to prioritise main issue: stable governance, punishment to nalayaks and reformation to bureaucracy.  - Individuals/ journalists harassing Gen-Z with their questions (which is not bad) but unable to speak in the same way to those nalayak leaders. They should be barking at them then Gen-Z group/individuals.   - Durga prasai: after all the tragedy and destruction,how can he say that he will bring another storm of protest. How can he openly request general public to make stock of food and gas at home. Enough is enough.   -People: Jumping on the bandwagon: same group of individual who attended the revolution are now planning to attend Dura prasai‚Äôs protest. Same group of individual who shared hate speech to their nalayak leaders are now praising again, same group of individuals who appreciated what they did during the revolution are not against them.   We are everywhere. Now, this is the time to be clear what and who we truly support.  . I really appreciate what this government is doing with all the challenges. I‚Äôm still positive that they will work on to make peace and prosperity.  . Based in my personal opinion.|||It was a anger buildup of 30 years of corruption concentrated in 1 day alongisde mass unemployment and that protest was like we scored 1 goal but conceded 5 goals in return. that 1 goal was few politicians got beat up and their houses torched (maybe you should get hints, it just needs a angry crowd) but the 5 goals are lots of weapons were looted (will be used in future civil war), police morale at lowest, lawlessness, a government approved by the \"indo-west\" MCC similar to bangladesh and free tibet (sudan gurung/TOB) has gained momentum to anger china. The current govt is also scared cause pepl know where they live and next time, their houses will be targeted|||Irrelevant but If anyone here is gay/ bi man in Kathmandu hmu.

He's always talked about his instance on corruption, called for investigation all the cases regardless of which party the alleged politicians belong to. He's always talked about how the top three leaders have ruined democracy and has established themselves as face of this system that has made people hate this system. He's said same thing in this interview too, and suddenly people are back to supporting him? So they actually never watched his interviews and just hopped in 'gagan hate club' or what?  If he hadn't been fighting against status quo (deuba gang) inside Nepali Congress, Gagan would've have been minister more than 6-7 times for sure. He actually should've done that in my opinion. his only executive role ever was a 9-10 month as health minister as far as I know.  Also, I might be called jholey as there are many RSP supporters here, and blame gagan for rabi being jailed which is so funny to me. you think the district courts, the high court and supreme court (which denied his habeas corpus writ) were bought? not one , not two but all three tier of courts? I don't buy that rabi is being kept in custody without any proof. Also, why did rabi not investigate Gagan for his bakhra chor case while he was home minister?",

That's because he still belongs to Nepali Congress. If he is to gain any of our trust, he'll have to rebrand himself with a new party. That's the least he could do.  What's the problem with Nepali Congress, the party? See, we all agree to the fact that the deep rooted curruption is the main single reason why our country is still undeveloped. It's not one single person or few.

(I'm not ranting only on Nepali Congress but all the other 2 as well). We need new faces who don't have their jholeys in these different organs and offices of government.

            "body": "Lee Kuan Yew once said, ‚ÄúIf Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered disciplined citizens.‚Äù Those words came from a leader who understood that progress is not built on chaos but on control, not on popularity but on principles. Singapore did not rise because of luck or slogans. It rose because its people accepted discipline, structure, and long-term vision, even when it was uncomfortable.  Nepal, sadly, seems to be heading in the opposite direction. We fought hard for democracy, for freedom, for rights. But somewhere along the way, we forgot that freedom without responsibility is self-destruction. Today, we can say anything, post anything, and do anything without consequence. What was once the voice of democracy has turned into the noise of disorder. We confuse outrage with awareness, and chaos with choice.  Look around and you will see it everywhere. People peeing on the streets, spitting in public, ignoring traffic lights, bribing officials to get their work done faster, and still blaming everything on ‚Äúbad leaders.‚Äù We fail to see that corruption is not only at the top; it begins within us. Giving a bribe is as much a crime as taking one. Our crisis is not just political; it is moral and cultural.  Freedom is beautiful, but when it comes without accountability, it breeds anarchy. Discipline is not a form of oppression it is the foundation on which a nation stands. The countries we admire today, such as Singapore, China, and even post-war South Korea, built their futures on order, not outrage. They accepted strong leadership and collective discipline, even when it meant individual discomfort. The result was growth, stability, and identity.  Nepal today, however, is driven by the wrong fuel. It is driven not by discipline but by social media, emotions, and narratives. We react to everything, think about nothing, and follow whoever shouts the loudest. Our national debates happen on TikTok and Facebook, not in classrooms or parliament. The danger is not that we will run out of freedom, but that we will drown in our own noise.  I fear that we are entering an era where the populist will triumph over the professional, where emotional speeches will defeat rational ideas. It is a sad truth, but Nepal has no Lee Kuan Yew. The closest we have is Harka Sampang a man with the heart of Lee Kuan Yew but without the mind/brain to match. He symbolizes our tragedy: passion without direction, courage without structure.  Meanwhile, many citizens are busy idolizing a so-called ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù sitting in jail, someone who has lived a life of controversy and even once renounced his Nepali identity. People follow him not for policy but for emotion, not for logic but for rebellion. This obsession with personalities over principles is the exact disease that destroys nations.  A country cannot be built on emotion alone. Emotions can ignite revolutions, but they cannot sustain them. Discipline, integrity, and intellect are what turn movements into nations. We need fewer loud heroes and more quiet builders people who repair roads before recording videos, who teach values before preaching patriotism, and who lead by example rather than outrage.  The truth is hard to accept, Nepal does not only lack leaders. It lacks disciplined citizens. A nation becomes strong not when its people defy the state but when both walk in balance. If citizens act responsibly and unite with shared purpose, they become more powerful than any government. But when citizens are divided by hate, driven by noise, and the state fears to enforce order, it becomes a failed one.  Unless we rediscover discipline, the very freedom we celebrate will keep destroying the nation we dream of building. Real freedom is not doing whatever we want. It is doing what is right, even when no one is watching. When looting becomes a proud moment and chaos a national celebration, it‚Äôs not freedom we‚Äôre living in; it‚Äôs decay disguised as democracy.",

I got a cough syrup from Nepali company (Brica-BM). The thing did not work at all and cough did not go away. Even after finishing the whole bottle, no change. Then I got cough syrup from Indian Company (grilinctus bm) and it was so effective that cough started to improve the next day.   The weird part is, both have the same drug composition and I took them at same dose.   Why didn't the nepali drug work? I tried asking others and story is same for a lot of people taking medicines for other conditions. Same drug, same composition but Nepali drugs are way less effective (sometimes not at all) compared to the indian ones.",

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||IK someone who is working as Customer Success Manager.

Think of farmers in Nepal who wake up every day to a relentless routine.. cutting grass for cattle, cleaning up animal waste to be used as manure, and managing the upkeep of their animals. They deal with the mess, the stress, and the constant demands of their daily tasks like working in the fields under the scorching heat or thundering rain. **They can‚Äôt afford to take a day off or complain about their workload. They simply** ***have*** **to get it done, no matter what.**  Then, there‚Äôs the second group, the ones who have the freedom to question their work, to voice dissatisfaction, and to contemplate changes in their careers or lifestyle. They have the luxury to consider whether they want to take on more responsibility or even leave their jobs if things aren‚Äôt going well. You have choices, even if they feel overwhelming at times but compared to the first group I feel like they're nothing. To me, I see it as comparing a broken leg with a paper cut.  >Now, My answer to you is simple. Do you really want to complain about your job which is paying a lot better if you ask me.

I don't know how I should feel about this post in general.

Or you could explore other options like ConnectIPS, Khalti, Bank cards, etc.  Regarding another question & concern about what problem does API solve?   \\- Assume you are running your business (selling products), as you have mentioned in the post, customers can just download the QR, pay and confirm via call or message (screenshot). For smaller scale this is feasible. But when it comes to scale, you won't be able to receive calls or verify payment screenshots of 100s of customers per day, you either need to hire more people or apply some automation. Another problem you will face is fake screenshots, order confusion, etc. Here's where APIs comes into play, once you integrate the API in your website, the API does the payment/verification part, your application (website) will connect the payment to the order, and flag the payment status as \"PAID\", you won't need to verify each and every payment. You can focus on the product and delivery.  TLDR; For small scale business, QR option with phone/message verification will work fine. For larger scale, API will help you a lot by automating the verification, and order status updates.|||Don't get it for 25k. It's negotiable.

I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn‚Äôt offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I‚Äôve heard things like ‚ÄúYesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo‚Äù. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn‚Äôt change.  I‚Äôve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn‚Äôt complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I‚Äôd had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I‚Äôm not done yet. Maybe there‚Äôs still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn‚Äôt choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I‚Äôve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn‚Äôt finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It‚Äôs tough, but I‚Äôm thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don‚Äôt need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn‚Äôt possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don‚Äôt know where I am, but one day I‚Äôll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second handüòÅ) all this within just one year. I can‚Äôt believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

Do you really think at this moment you are not slave ? Bro this is a problem with democracy. Democracy work in such a way that it seems like democracy but it is dictatorship. During the removal of monarchy just see how many people died there and now see how many people die. You can see the clear difference. After the end of monarchy the king silently returned but now see the attitude of this KP baze. The is pretending to be greater then king. So Who is the king? And are you a slave or not now? I am also not pro monarchy but if you could build a democratic system which is really a democratic then it's Great. But the single fact is, it is not possible. About Hindu rastha I am a  Atheist. But still I support Hindu rastha. Do you know why. The first step to break any country is to remove the pride for there culture and religion. So the establishment of Christianity is not random it is heavily planned. So Just to protect the country I am with Hindu rastha even being atheist.Yep monarchy was not good and evil before but I think it will work better cause of fear of People. They saw many people protest and Foreign intervention. So I hove they can rule better. And what's different in the political party and Monarchy. Only one difference, Political party is for certain time so they have the concept to just take a bribe and collect a lot of money for future retirement and there children. But for King they are permanent and there pride is associated from the standard of their country. One person of 100billion dollar networth VS a King with 100billiondollar GDP. In this case the king will have more pride. At last I don't know whether the monarchy will be good for our country or not but I know It can never go more worst than this. Edit:    Also one point is Our country Just need Stability and some long term vision. Other Development can be easily done by the youth of Nepal.|||Raja Huda, ko chai slave thyo ra pahila ü§î|||Gyanu le affai ma aaudina vandai cha ta. Kina attirako bro",

Both were done by the West through TV and meta apps, and yet we are too stubborn to see it because of our ego. And still, people want to die for those- they worship blindly, but not for their own kings. Kings -especially the Shah dynasty, were the true heirs of this country. They are literally the founders of this nation, and yet this generation doesn‚Äôt realize it.   If we don‚Äôt realize why we are in a mess today, then we shouldn‚Äôt call the UN for help when things get worse in the future and believe me, it will. And the matter of fact, the UN doesn‚Äôt truly exist for justice; pedo-elites are at the top hierarchy.  We are not a developed country because we try to copy the West and their agendas to go against India and China, which are now two supergiants. The media also played its part well, creating division through religion, caste, and gender. Nothing like that should exist in a free world. God is one source-energy and eternal, yet we are too brainwashed to see the truth.  This isn‚Äôt the same Nepal that we once cherished and loved. Our history is slowly turning into ashes, and we‚Äôre enjoying every bit of it without understanding the true hidden agendas.

And she was 18 and he was 22 during the time of the incident.  Here are the details released by the court about the case:  1. Victim was 18+ and lied about her age 2. The girl checked into the room while Sandeep was parking, and they were holding hands leaving the hotel after the alleged rape based on CCTV evidence reviewed by the court. 3. The girl had a boyfriend and told her roommate she needed sponsorship from Sandeep 4. The accuser asked her roommate to lie to her boyfriend about her whereabouts.  5. While out with Sandeep, the roommate checked in; accuser said everything was going well, with no distress signals. 6. She lied to the roommate about returning home, saying Sandeep would drop her at a friend's place to hide spending the night. 7. The roommate testified that, upon returning the next morning, the victim appeared joyful and soon began enthusiastically following Lamichhane's cricket matches. 8. The roommate overheard the victim on a phone call post-fallout (after Lamichhane left for cricket abroad without fulfilling promises), discussing extracting \"at least 10-15 lakhs\" via a legal case. 9. The roommate (a key witness) provided the bulk of behavioral and motive evidence during appeal hearings. Combined with CCTV (demanding voluntary check-in/exit), social media logs (victim-initiated contact), and lack of physical proof of force, it led to the **clean acquittal.**  Plus, **fck Paradigm TV** and the brain rot content and 'influencers' that they promote in their channel. I noticed their viewership is slowly dying, so this controversy might be a good thing for them to become a little relevant but the audience are smarter now and see right through these people.",

            "body": "Sandy, you really outdid yourself this time. One day you‚Äôre ‚Äúprotecting your dignity,‚Äù the next you‚Äôre lecturing YouTubers about morality while your own fanbase floods the internet with threats and abuse in your name. Irony called; it wants its crown back.  Let‚Äôs get real. Paradygm didn‚Äôt invent your controversy, **you** did. And now, instead of introspection, we get a Facebook rant about ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù and ‚Äúcharacter assassination.‚Äù No, Sandy. That‚Äôs not a conspiracy. That‚Äôs a consequence. You can‚Äôt play the victim of public opinion when you wrote the script yourself.  And the funniest part? The same Sandy who‚Äôs crying about people ‚Äúmocking‚Äù his life is now silently watching his stans do exactly that to the women and creators who merely scratched the surface of the topic. Harassment, rape threats, mockery, insults, death wishes, all in your defence. So tell me, Sandy, are you going to post another essay about that? Or does ‚Äúshame on you‚Äù only apply when someone else talks back?  The women and creators you‚Äôve defamed aren‚Äôt sitting quietly. They will be documenting everything, the messages, the threats, the slander. And if needed, they‚Äôll file actual cases of actual defamation, unlike a mere mention of your rape charges in a YouTube video.  Defamation, online harassment, cyberbullying, death threats, rape threats, and name-calling. Real legal action, not dramatic Facebook paragraphs. You will suffer because of your actions.  So, Sandy, here‚Äôs a tip: before you start crying ‚Äúassassination of character,‚Äù maybe stop letting your followers do the same thing you claim to hate. You‚Äôre not the victim of a smear campaign; you‚Äôre the author of your own downfall.  Keep talking, Sandy. Every post digs the hole deeper. And this time, it‚Äôs not the internet that‚Äôll judge, it‚Äôs the law, the people who know what defamation is and what's not.",

He was defamed by the guests and he pointed it out.  The girl is definitely playing victim card and have not even apologized. She mentioned a personal case so cheaply in the show. If I was in Sandy's place, I would have sued her and Paradygm TV for defamation. When you are a public personality and say something so insensitive, there are always frustrated people in the society to spit all the hate and abuse. Not everyone is capable to be a celebrity/influencer. Its not for everyone. Even though, she did not deserve this abuse it is the reality of society. HATE IS FOR THE WEAK someone said.  And to people telling that its all boys. No there are girls as well. Being the case that there are most of the boys who are commenting, it is because the audience of cricket is primarily boys in Nepal. So, that would reflect in the comments too.|||Khup hasis mya chickney...jatha aafu sandeep ko thai ma vako vayae thaha pauthis|||Bro you really wanna say something do it in your insta or other platforms ja alik real impact ayucha.

He might've been acquitted by the court upon appeal, but that does not prove his innocence. It is so frustrating how the burden of proof is upon the victim.    Fans acting as if his cricket skills makeup for the fact that he raped a minor and if you don't believe it, he still had sex with a barely 18-year-old girl, who was poor and star struck by the guy. This happens way too often where athletes misuse their fame and influence.    We are not unaware of how easily influential people in Nepal get away with anything, they've gotten away with hit-and-runs, DUIs, this is only a rape of a girl, they already care less. It is disgusting how he was even allowed to play and still represented Nepal while he had an ongoing case. This is why victims don't come forward.    But of course guys would have no regard for that girl, because for most guys the number of rapes happening is merely a statistic BUT for almost every woman, it is a reality that they could be exposed to at any time. I definitely believe the girl more, I think she was a victim.       People complain about false allegations but according to studies, \"False rape allegations are rare, with studies consistently finding that approximately 2% to 10% of reports are proven false.¬†Rigorous research indicates the rate is typically between 2% and 8%.¬†The perception that false allegations are common is largely a myth that can discourage real victims from reporting sexual violence.\" Rape allegations ruin a woman's life more than it ruins a man, even though he's the perpetrator!

He, sunil sharma are very powerful people. Dr. Govinda KC advocates for govt funded medical colleges with 75% scholarship seats to be established in underserved areas but these mafias don‚Äôt let him do that. Instead, they want to increase the seats in their private colleges. Mind you, fee 40-45 lakhs vaye ni they charge well over 60-70 lakhs; especially ku affiliated colleges like kmc, noble etc. medical education commission ko rule mai medical students lai college ko hostel optional huna parney rule cha but these people make it compulsory and charge absurd amount of fees; normally monthly 10-15K hostel fee huna parney ma, they charge 30-35K.   Most private medical colleges currently have 100 seats but capacity 50-60 students ko cha. Yet, they somehow convinced oli to intercept and increase the seats to 120-130. The retarded oli, prachande, shere had always favored these medical mafias and these people probably give hefty chanda to their parties. Desh ma kei bipat aauda, they act like they are providing service but in reality, patients lai ni ekdam lutcha. Asti genz protest huda kmc (owned by sunil sharma) said ghaitey lai free treatment but discharge huney bela they were slammed with 30-40K bills.

Especially when they have started their own family, and that's a point where you really learn to be selfless for the first time in your entire life. First time you would probably feel like you are living for someone else than yourselves. But I wouldn't know what it really is like since I haven't reached that point. I feel like younger perverts just don't have the courage at that point in their life to do something like that. I asked an older guy I know like mid 40s why do you stare at young girls moreso than younger guys do, I told him it's common to look at girls as we are attracted to them but we still give them some personal space to not make them feel threated by staring like a creep. He said that maybe you guys are used to watching women dressed in modern ways and are more adapted to it that it's not a problem for you if you see a women in more or less revealing ways compared to the past, to you it's normal so you don't think much of it, we weren't used to seeing women dress that way in the past. Before some moron with low English comprehension skills misunderstands, don't even try. It's an opinion as to why they do, what they do not justification. This isn't my opinion. I'm only trying to learn more as to why older guys are such perverts by sharing this and if someone has a better insight to it.|||If your story is true than sad to hear this.

Try to answer all 1 mark questions correctly otheriwse A+ aaudaina. Then in 4 mark qn, I wrote 2 lines of introduction (definition) then I skipped a line and wrote \"The related points are below\" I wrote 6 points then concluded in 2 lines. That should cover 75% of the page. Start every 4 and 7 mark QN from a new page. In 7 mark qn, I wrote around a para of introduction then 12 points then a paragraph of conclusion.   3. In Nepali, get all the grammar correct and try to maintain the answer sheet clean. Decent length ans will get you an A+   4. Maths ra Opt maths ma ta tei practice gare pugi halxa. Testo confusing kehi aaudaina. Comp maths ko theorem chahi hernu unseen wala YouTube bata. That will be enough. Ani question bank bata practice gare pugi halxa maths ta opt maths ma. Opt maths ko trigonometry ko 24 no ma prove garne ma ni dhyan dinu ani vector theorem. Vector theorem chahi ghar ma nai 4, 5 choti practice garnu.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

And the army doesn't have all the blame to take. Lord knows what security council was busy in. What purpose does a security council serve if it cannot hold a meeting in emergency. Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own.

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||Does working as janitor at Netflix count?|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else üôåüèΩ|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing?

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||IK someone who is working as Customer Success Manager.

Think of farmers in Nepal who wake up every day to a relentless routine.. cutting grass for cattle, cleaning up animal waste to be used as manure, and managing the upkeep of their animals. They deal with the mess, the stress, and the constant demands of their daily tasks like working in the fields under the scorching heat or thundering rain. **They can‚Äôt afford to take a day off or complain about their workload. They simply** ***have*** **to get it done, no matter what.**  Then, there‚Äôs the second group, the ones who have the freedom to question their work, to voice dissatisfaction, and to contemplate changes in their careers or lifestyle. They have the luxury to consider whether they want to take on more responsibility or even leave their jobs if things aren‚Äôt going well. You have choices, even if they feel overwhelming at times but compared to the first group I feel like they're nothing. To me, I see it as comparing a broken leg with a paper cut.  >Now, My answer to you is simple. Do you really want to complain about your job which is paying a lot better if you ask me.

I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.

They‚Äôre asking for any proof people might have videos, photos, eyewitness accounts, documents, or other evidence related to excessive force, abuse, or violations during the protests.  üì© How to share evidence:  * Email directly to¬†[investigation@nhrcnepal.org](mailto:investigation@nhrcnepal.org) * Or submit physically at any NHRC office (central, provincial, or branch ‚Äî full list in notice). * Whatsapp - Dr. Tikaram Pokharel (Spokesperson): 9851053127, Shyam Babu Kafle (Asst. Spokesperson): 9851199095, Prakash Bhatta: 9849733001  I‚Äôd also like to add that the InDepthStory team to my knowledge has collected a huge amount of material from the protests. If they could share their evidence with NHRC, it would massively strengthen the investigation. Let's DM them or email them directly to encourage them to contribute to this cause.  Let's make a meaningful contribution as an internet community and help bring the victims justice.  Source: [Home | NHRC NEPAL](https://www.nhrcnepal.org/)",

Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own.

And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Most of all, register and VOTE.|||No, we should be thankful that we have overcome the first step of political crisis. Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

Turns out my curtains are almost transparent when the room light is on.  Now I‚Äôm panicking, thinking my neighbors might have seen everything that happens in my room for months. I feel so embarrassed and disgusted. They may have seen me masturbate as i do it regularly.  I don‚Äôt even want to switch my lights on anymore. I just want to hide. I cant shift to other places cause its my own home. How do I face them now? Should I just act normal and pretend nothing happened?",

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there.

Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it‚Äôs not.

Think of farmers in Nepal who wake up every day to a relentless routine.. cutting grass for cattle, cleaning up animal waste to be used as manure, and managing the upkeep of their animals. They deal with the mess, the stress, and the constant demands of their daily tasks like working in the fields under the scorching heat or thundering rain. **They can‚Äôt afford to take a day off or complain about their workload. They simply** ***have*** **to get it done, no matter what.**  Then, there‚Äôs the second group, the ones who have the freedom to question their work, to voice dissatisfaction, and to contemplate changes in their careers or lifestyle. They have the luxury to consider whether they want to take on more responsibility or even leave their jobs if things aren‚Äôt going well. You have choices, even if they feel overwhelming at times but compared to the first group I feel like they're nothing. To me, I see it as comparing a broken leg with a paper cut.  >Now, My answer to you is simple. Do you really want to complain about your job which is paying a lot better if you ask me.

I don't know how I should feel about this post in general.

That‚Äôs how we will get more information on the practice and then we can determine whether the tradition is actually jeopardising the child‚Äôs mental health or not.   But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.   Anyways, I am open for a discussion and may be able to pose any questions to the people in the inner circle.

Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

You‚Äôve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families. Where do you think that is abusive? You are living in a bubble. It is a different culture and a tradition it doesnt mean that it is abusive. Kumaris have had a long history, have you ever heard one of them come out and say that it was traumatic?

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended. So please watch podcasts of ex kumaris. Btw I'm not Newar. I'm not from valley either.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture.

But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie.

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country.

Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala?

Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it‚Äôs easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it‚Äôs ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home.

Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards.

Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash.

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‚Äòreal‚Äô identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba. That selective outrage is nothing but hypocrisy.|||I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem at all. You need to be inclusive to all religions and culture.

Don‚Äôt get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that‚Äôs why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one‚Äôs own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today‚Äôs world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity. It's better that Chettri shouldn't be inferring in Gurung's culture and lifestyle. SImilarl, Limbu shouldn't be talking and critiquing Bahuns way of doing things. Same respective cultural practices should be carried out by other caste ethnicities.|||Secularism isn‚Äôt westernization. It‚Äôs modernization.|||>Nepali culture is not perfect, but it is ours. Reform must come from us  You said it yourself. It is not perfect and they might need reform.  >orchestrated online campaigns that want us to be ashamed of who we are  I have seen various posts claiming the same thing. What is the basis for that? Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea. I haven't seen it being criticized or ridiculed by anyone else from international communities.  >We are debating in Western language, wearing Western dress, using Western devices, and posting on Western platforms. Naturally these spaces are full of hate against Nepali culture, because the ecosystem itself is designed to amplify Western values while mocking our own.  How ironic! You could have at least posted this in Nepali then. I don't think most people's goal is to mock our culture, it's more of constructive criticism, at least, from my point of view. Well I do have criticism about lots of aspects of many western cultures as well. But if I make a post or comment pertaining to that then lots of people like you would probably just accuse me of emphasizing western culture too much. I criticize Nepali culture and tradition because I grew up on them and I know them well and it's part of my lifestyle as well. My philosophy is, criticize the part of things you love but find problematic, don't just accept them as they are.|||Not every but u need to understand some of them trully are , Its good to follow tradition but with time we also should improvise , child abuse is a thing people need to consider seriously , I am not only talking about Kumari pratha , also putting children in dungeons during menstrual cycle should be taken seriously.

If we asked 100 ex-Kumaris about their experiences and whether they felt exploited or saw it as a privilege, I‚Äôm confident most would say they didn‚Äôt feel abused, contrary to what many internet activists claim.  To better understand the reality, I‚Äôll share links to interviews and articles featuring former Royal Kumaris, published by BBC and ABC.  Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn‚Äôt right, but those conditions don‚Äôt exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life. (as per 2019 article)  So, don‚Äôt let disconnected keyboard warriors, who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots, misrepresent our beautiful tradition as a story of abuse or exploitation.

The respect and reverence given to the Kumari is not only religious but also a reflection of Nepal‚Äôs rich history and traditions. These people just find way to get away from traditions.

The divine grace of the Kumari was thought to ensure his prosperity and the kingdom‚Äôs peace and stability.|||Yep, I've talked to an exKumari myself and she said she felt honored about being chosen. Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists. In the past there were some issues about schooling and prejudice against marrying exKumari but there have been lots of reforms and cultural mindset changes now, led by exKumaris themselves. If you don't believe in Kumari or are an atheist, noone is forcing you to visit her or seek blessing.

While people are quick to dismiss cultural practices like this in the name of modernization and woke values, they easily forget that tantric traditions are very much alive and thriving in Nepal. Better not mess with those. If you are a non-believer, move on for your own good I would say.|||Not beautiful, it's an ass culture. Calling some random ass little girl a goddess, and dump her the moment she bleeds ü§£ It's straight up bullshit, nothing is beautiful in this. Mfs worshipping an imprisoned child while they discriminate with their own daughter irl, uh oh.|||But what‚Äôs the actual point of doing this? What real good does it bring to anyone? You‚Äôre essentially giving a child an isolated, skewed upbringing just so she can be paraded in front of crowds to keep a collective fantasy alive.   Why does tradition require the sacrifice of a child's possible normal upbringing?|||Op newar nai hola hai? I have seen newari people are obsessed with thier caste and religion|||Kumari tradition is the same as taking young boys from villages and making them lamas.|||It's frustrating how often the beautiful and complex Kumari tradition in Nepal is framed by Western narratives as \"child abuse\" or \"isolation.\" This viewpoint, which frequently emphasizes themes of captivity and trauma, completely ignores the testimonies of former Kumaris and the significant modern safeguards and support systems in place.  The facts, based on local Nepali voices and government policies, paint a very different, much more nuanced picture that overwhelmingly supports the continuation of this vital cultural practice, proving it is not exploitative in nature.    The Reality of the Living Goddess: A Cultural Privilege üá≥üáµ  Not Isolated, But Tutored and Connected: The claim of \"isolation from family\" is a common critique. In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it‚Äôs either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything‚Äù When you are isolated from the things that kids do at their age, you are anything but ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

Feeling privileged and living in a bubble does exactly the opposite.|||Khasma kura ta, yeti sano umer mai yesto garnu baccha ko adhikar ra mental, physical growth ko kura ma ho.

If you don't like it, be silent. Live respectfully separately. Peacefully.|||when someone grows up fully immersed in a tradition, they often won‚Äôt criticize it because it‚Äôs tied to their identity and sense of pride. That doesn‚Äôt make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn‚Äôt mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||This was much needed! Thank you!|||BS, this pratha is blatant child abuse no matter what you try to mask it with. An old dude inspecting every body part for selection, them being isolated from their childhood, gaining awkward social skills and hampering overall development after it is all over, etc. Just grotesque acts committed in the name of culture. The ex-kumaris are brainwashed so ofc they will only talk good things about it.|||The idea that Kumari directly conflicts and contradicts the UNHRC and UNESCO is fascinating.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

I thought I‚Äôd go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that‚Ä¶ but now, I don‚Äôt even feel like staying in science. Lately, I‚Äôve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I‚Äôm not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don‚Äôt excite me anymore, and law‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don‚Äôt want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor‚Äôs where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me ‚Äî social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.

It's not due to lack of knowledge from his side that makes it hard for us to grab the concepts, it's just the fact that he's shit at teaching and doesn't care about whether or not everyone understands. Regardless, I'm studying CS and want a good base in maths for the future. Mero first term aaudai cha, I tried to go through a few YouTube channels, some of them are alright but I already struggle with maths & physics so it's pretty difficult to understand *everything* I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest any channels (or alternative platforms) which are good.

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
