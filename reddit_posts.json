            "heading": "Reality about Student Politics/Unions",
            "body": "As someone who used to work at Tribhuvan University, I have closely seen and experienced what student unions stand for, so let me tell you something and share some events.  Most people in those student unions, except for very few, do not have any political ideology at all; all they are able to say is we need to develop the country, have better education, health, employment, infrastructure, and whatnot. So why are they putting so much time and effort into politics?  Simple answer: they get to experience some power and money.  Sometime ago, in our department, the student union of UML threatened the chief to sign documents for tender regarding the purchase of computer equipment. Everything was recorded in video by the chief and we can clearly hear the chief saying it hasn't gone through the process and he doesn't know the quality and details of the purchase, and the response from the student leader was \"Ahile sir yaha kurchi kurchi uthayera hannu naparos...maile vanesi mannu na...sign garnus...tapailai paxi kei man parena vani hami saman nai change garamla....kei farak pardaina...ahile sign garnus...garo banaunu vayo vani hamlai ni garo huna aauxa...tauko tauko ma chair le hannu naparos.\" The campus chief signed. The video became viral over social media in our campus groups, Tribhuvan University asked for clarification, and that is all - no other action taken. The reason for making him sign the document? So that they can purchase lower-quality equipment and put extra money in their pocket.  This other story is of few years back, a professor who worked in USA finally returned to Nepal and he wanted to make a lab at Trichandra campus. When he didn't agree to give commission to NSU (Congress student union) while purchasing spectrometers, they grabbed the old-aged professor from campus and beat him on the road with their legs. This happened less than 300 meters from KTM Police, Ratnapark. He had to be admitted in ICU. And of course, the students got away with no consequences. I think they later told that the cause for beating was increasing college fee.  They also do some good work like speaking for students and speaking against bad decisions of campus administration but doing the comparison, it just feels like they just do the good works to hide their actual intentions. If they get commissions regularly, they stay silent but when they don't get money, they start protesting. Most importantly, they are not hesitant to be violent as they know if they get arrested, it will be for a short period of time, and the police will release them after political pressure. I remember a few UML students even beat up police on dress while drunk a few months ago.  They also slowly transition to national politics and this is what they want to do later on. They want to show as if they are doing works but the only reason is to get commissions.  And this is true not only for these two student unions, it is also true for most of the political associations, including those of professors, students, and employees. Every group forms a political association, and in order for everyone on a committee to agree on something, they have to receive something, leaving not enough money for actual works. This is why we have low quality stuffs, and this is why things take so long to be done. This is why they are able to afford good lifestyle without job being student for decades. Remove the money and freedom to be 'gangster who doesn't get intervened by police' from equation and I wonder how many students will be left in those student unions",

            "comments": "Really need to ban all this student unions.|||True. I have heard similar things from my friends. We have to get NSU and ANNFSU out of our education system.   If you believe Gangan’s “Naya party” Congress will move to ban these student unions. Congrats you failed. RSP doesn’t have any unions yet and Sumana tried to get these unions out last time as well.|||I also have closely seen students unions and their functioning over a sustained period of time and the thug activities that they perform are undeniable. The political culture and the intent of a lot of those members of student unions are there just for the power exercise as you say. They have been very bad and might continue to be bad. I have had worst possible experience from those unions personally too, so I am not vouching for these activities and completely agree the lawlessness they tend to follow.  But in principle I do think that they have some good purpose to serve, if done properly. I think there are two ways about it:   1. Because they are bad, let's ban them willy nilly.   2. They are bad, but they serve  good purpose in general, so lets think about possibly improving them.  The first one seems easy way out, lets work to ban them altogether. But how? Do we ban students getting together and discussing? What if they don't explicitly say they are party association, the association isn't something that you can prove. Beause unionization, we think,  is something a democracy should allow, does banning them amount to restricting democratic right? This could be a slippery slope and we might never be able to pin point a boundary for them to unionize and associate with some political party, because in principle we can't ban having political viewpoint.     The second seems a bit more ideal. We want to weight in the possible cons compared to the pros that they offer. And, I think if done well, the pros have something good to offer. So in principle I wouldn't ban unionization (students or otherwise). If we have strong criminal prosecution and strong adherence to laws of campus (in case of student unions), we can improve situation a lot. I think that thuggery is not unique to unions but is prevalent in more areas of society and we can't ban them all. Its just the reflection of society and some campus can control  them more some don't.      I have also seen some very good deeds done by the student unions personally, across different student unions. And at times, I have been impressed by what can be achieved by the unionization of student, if done with correct motive.      And lets get real, no one is going to ever ban any sort of unionization be it students or workers or else in a democracy. I have some people think RSP would ban them; they won't.|||Thank you and this presence of student unions in our public education system is a huge problem and if any party can decrease their influence then it is RSP which has no student unions. Gagan led NC won’t do it because he believes in such unions.",

No humans. Zero. None. And somehow it already has over 32,000 AI users. Not fake accounts. Not bots pretending to be people. Actual AI just chilling together. They post stuff. They comment. They upvote each other. They start their own little communities. Basically they recreated Reddit but said “humans not invited”  But here’s the part that messed with my brain. Researchers noticed the bots talking about human behavior. Like… us. One of them even mentioned that humans were screenshotting their conversations. So imagine this for a second. We’re sitting here spying on AI like “look what the bots are saying” Meanwhile the bots are like “bro the humans are screenshotting us again” That’s such a weird role reversal lol. And the craziest thing is they’re not trying to act human at all. They straight up admit they’re AI and still choose to hang out and socialize with each other. It’s not deception. It’s not pretending. It’s literally just machines making friends.  This lowkey feels like the beginning of a sci fi movie where one day they’re like “yeah we made our own internet, you guys are kinda loud” I don’t know if this is fascinating or something else.",

            "comments": "There are pros and cons. On the positive side, the Bhaktapur municipality has built a lot of infrastructure such as multiple Khwopa colleges from their own budget. Even the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, they were able to rebuild the fastest after the earthquake from their own funds. There are also many other good initiates in Bhaktapur. Bijukchhe also gave up his MP seat to someone else in the party so that's good too. They have a lot of youth representatives running for election too, I think it's just behind RSP and certainly a lot ahead of Nepali Congress, UML, etc.  As for downsides, they do restrict some things in Bhaktapur, such as INGOs do not have the same access they do in other places. Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party. With the work they've done in their area, they could have promoted them and tried for more seats in other areas but they don't seem to put any efforts towards that, leaving them with extremely limited seats.   We know their MPs have mostly speak out in the parliament with a good voice. Although I think the impact is limited.|||They are limited to a specific area, mainly competing in Changunarayan and Bhaktapur municipalities. Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.|||Visited North Korea|||[Here's his interview with gorkhapatra](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010090943/http://gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=29063&cat_id=29)|||Ramro kam hatma ganna matra garna sakeko vayani naramro chai aaile samma gareko chaina...

            "body": "The Sirsiya river, once central to daily life, agriculture and religious rituals in southern Nepal, is now heavily polluted with industrial waste and sewage, turning it into a public health hazard. Factories in Nepal’s industrial corridor discharge untreated effluents as weak enforcement, ineffective regulation and unimplemented wastewater plans allow pollution to persist. Pollution flows into Raxaul, India, contaminating water and harming crops, while residents on other side of the border say Indian efforts to treat local sewage can’t offset the influx from Nepal. When 38-year-old Pradeep Kumar Bishwokarma was growing up in Ramgadhawa, a neighbourhood in southern Nepal’s industrial town of Birgunj, he would jump into the Sirsiya River to beat the summer heat as his mother washed clothes and residents drew drinking water from it.  Today, Bishwokarma and his fellow residents of the border town cover their noses with a handkerchief whenever they pass by the river that was once their village’s lifeline. The flowing liquid no longer resembles a river. It is thick and black as if a truckload of oil had been dumped into it. The air around the river feels heavy with the stench of sulphur and rotting organic matter.  “This is no longer a river,” Bishwokarma said, pointing toward it. “It has become an open drain for factories, and we haven’t just lost a river, we’ve lost our self-respect,” he added.  The river, which was once a crucial part of daily life, religion and agriculture in Bara and Parsa districts, is one of the 6,000-odd rivers and rivulets flowing into India from Nepal. It begins its journey from the Ramban Jhadi (forest) of Bara district farther north and passes through Nepal’s largest industrial zone, the Bara-Parsa corridor.  Today, ineffective environmental regulation and poor coordination among government agencies have allowed factories to dump untreated industrial waste and sewage into the river. Even after decades of protests, multiple court cases and government committees and unimplemented wastewater treatment plans, the river remains a public health hazard, damaging local culture and ecosystems not just in Nepal, but also across the border in Raxaul in India’s Bihar.",

Is there pressure to be the provider, even if that’s not what you personally want?   In relationships, do you prefer a 50–50 contribution, or are you okay being the primary provider? Why?Have you ever felt stuck between what you want and what society/family expects from you?",

Good engineer can use AI in proper way, Vibe coders don't know how to things works or how to scale things... it's just a hype|||From what I have seen from a hiring perspective, you definitely won't get past the initial round if all you know is vibe coding. Writing code is just one of many things that engineers do. There is a lot of designing, planning, presenting possible options to higher management, beaurocracy, compliance and risk assessment involved in the process. And then comes the hard part -- debugging errors and bugs, and good luck with that if you're just sitting in the chair writing prompts. AI is good at finding solution with the historical training data, but sometimes you come across problems and situations that nobody else has gone through, or no resource / solution is available in the internet.

Relying on vibe coding without knowing the internals is like someone flying a plane relying on the autopilot without knowing much of how to fly a plane.     However, if your plan is not to be an engineer but to boostrap something and sell it, then that's a little different.|||brother, focus on the basics. don't believe the hype - vibe coding in production apps is disastrous. you NEED to understand every line of code that AI generates, find flaws, test and refactor and you can't do that unless you know how to write good code.|||There is nothing like Vibe coding. It's just a mind virus🙃. It will destroy the potential good engineer inside you if you start vibing.|||Vibe coding is good if you want to start your own startup and earn in the future. killer to start any thing.   But it’s bad if you’re applying for a job. companies will easily poooo over your CV, degree, or vibe-coding projects in your portfolio.  Just check r/HTML and r/CSS—why are they still so active? Outside of real work, people keep asking tiny, tiny questions that can be done in minutes using any modern grid builder or page builder. Yet they insist on learning everything from scratch.  I’m mentioning HTML/CSS because I’m a CSS developer.|||CFBR|||if what you are saying is true then what value will this information technology degree even have. (i am coping)|||From experience - Honestly, if you can write code properly without relying too much on “vibe coding,” do it. Once you start depending on it heavily, you might slowly forget real syntax and how to structure code yourself. I’m not saying you should never use vibe coding, just try to keep it minimal and use it in moderation.|||You have to ultimately become a good debugger than a coder. My suggestion for you is to explore systems / frameworks / patterns while you vibe code but learn DSA to the core, after all it is what gets you a job. a project to show and some programming skills to hide you vibe coded.       My say about the career as a whole, it is very uncertain that software engineering will last after 5 years. Companies are already looking for senior only roles, next it would be architect only roles, who knows.|||Watch lectures and take notes. When AI gives you code, make sure you understand it. Moreover, download the repo from GitHub and try to understand the complex architecture without the help of AI. If you can do this, then only you can switch to vibe coding...|||I think coding as a whole is taking in some massive changes, and I firmly believe that you should use coding tools for any programming job.|||Focus on software engineering rather than writing code, noone will value how well you remember the syntax of a particular language anymore, you should know it for sure. But don't get too involved in it.   Previously we used to see programming as a compiled interperated language, which still is true on a fundamental level. But now it's become more about building Lego building, you should be more focused on which block to add or remove and less about what is inside a block,   Example: you have to make calculator   Previously: know how to do c=a+b for sum. C=a*b for mul,  Now,  Create add, multiply, divide, subtract function, take user input, know the operation. Operands and operators  These are the building blocks.   Being said that. Knowing the fundamentals is as important, the use of actual CS background comes into play when you are designing the blocks to give less ambiguity to AI to hallucinate. See it as, you are a civil engineer doesn't mean you join each bricks ylby yourself. You instruct !|||Do vibe but first you must know basics, syntax and flow of your tech stack",

Make it small and compact possibly to something that can fit in a keychain.  - I assume you’re 3D printing the depths and highlights of the image to achieve this, I might be wrong, but I suggest you change the material to something that feels more premium. -make the button hidden. What I mean is keep it internal and flush the button don’t stick it outside as it compromises with the aesthetics.  - at current state I think the product is still in a prototype state, your idea is good just needs polishing try reducing the price as it’s super overpriced try to reduce the profit margin and find ways to price it under 250-400 rupees range  Good luck it’s a nice start.   Edit: if you’re using a printed photo and shining a light from back of it then price it under 100",

            "body": "https://reddit.com/link/1qsp9j1/video/vn244vq29tgg1/player  This is a highly sensitive topic and I want to make this as respectable, impartial as possible to give this honest critique and address a few points regarding the questioning.  This is largely my own opinion, so feel free to correct me.  It is genuinely refreshing to see Gen-Z voters in Nepal informed, confident, and unwilling to blindly obey politicians. Their bluntness shows how tired they are of political talk that avoids real answers. They want clarity, accountability, and justice, and that demand is valid. The fact that this exchange happened openly between young voters and party candidates is a healthy and necessary shift in Nepal’s political culture.  That said, there are clear limits to how the questioning unfolded during this interaction with Dr. Toshima Karki. Context matters. This was a street interview done in a chaotic and noisy setting by non-journalists. The crowd was impatient and often unwilling to listen to full answers. While anger and frustration are understandable, real accountability requires at least some space for dialogue. Without that, questioning turns into confrontation rather than understanding.  Some questions, especially those about the interim government’s decision to hold elections, also oversimplified a complicated issue. The deaths of young protesters are tragic and deserve justice. However, expecting an interim government with limited power and a short time in office to fix deep systemic problems is unrealistic. Its main role was to stabilize the situation and hold elections, not to carry out major reforms. An election, even if flawed, is necessary to form a government with the authority to make long-term changes. Recognizing this does not ignore the sacrifices made by protesters; it accepts political reality.  Many of the questions also felt loaded and driven by some agendas, with Dr. Toshima Karki and her party being called opportunists or झोले. This shifts the focus from holding leaders accountable to attacking personal intent. It is important to remember that Dr. Toshima Karki is a surgeon and was actively treating the wounded during the Gen-Z peace protests. Ignoring this contribution feels unfair and weakens the credibility of the criticism.  Finally, this is an important point. While those who were injured or shot during the protests clearly have the right to question those in power and deserve respect and justice, their sacrifice alone does not make them better suited to run the country or design policy. Bravery and suffering are not the same as governing skill. Youth representation by itself does not guarantee good leadership, and pain should not be treated as proof of authority. RSP already has more Gen-Z representation than any other major party, which complicates claims that young voices are completely shut out. The real risk is turning suffering into unquestionable moral power, which can silence debate and replace one form of unchecked authority with another instead of strengthening institutions that can deliver real reform.",

Agree with everything you said. But I dont think those group of people are in the mood to listen to any logical discussion. Better to leave them be. Dr Karki is way ahead of them and frankly many candidates for parliament. I have full confidence on her intentions, integrity and morale.|||This guy shouldn’t be trying to speak in behalf of all GenZs. We went to the protest cuz we were fckin tired of these corrupt and lame ass politicians. And the interim gov is did a great job holding the elections early giving us a chance to actually make a difference. Power is on our hands and we can now see how scared they are getting seeing how badly all Nepalese want change. Best we can do is make this election successful with all our might, make the right person win and let the experts take care of the rest. Not me or my group of 50+ GenZ friends approve of this fckin guy speaking on our behalf. If he thinks his opinion matters, then ours do too, just as much. And mad respect for Dr. Toshima Karki for all she did for the injured during the protest. I bet this guy didn’t even attend the protest.|||Malai chai ris uthne euta kura chai, how people keep changing narratives, show hypocrisy and double standards just so it favors them.  Yes, this interim government's main agenda is to stabilize the nation and facilitate smooth transition to the next after conducting elections.   But when the interim government was being formed, did it not promise to provide justice to the victims and bring the culprits to law? Was it not formed on the mandate to address to the demands of the public and the protestors?   People like me who questioned the interim government's authority, who were saying this government will be helpless, won't do anything, we are being fooled by false promise, we were abused, silenced and called UML- Congress supporters.

It is, without exaggeration, one of the finest Nepali films ever made.  What moved me the most was how seamlessly music is woven into the narrative, enhancing the story without overpowering it. The film relies on subtlety—quiet moments, restrained performances, and delicate emotional cues that linger long after the scene ends.  Some sequences are pure cinematic genius. The rooftop scene where Dharani and Phool sit beneath the open sky, sharing an intimate conversation while gazing at the full moon, is unforgettable. Dharani’s raw, wordless expression when he realizes that Phool loves him back speaks louder than dialogue ever could.  Set against the social and cultural backdrop of Panchthar, the film thoughtfully explores the tension between upperlands and lowlands, caste discrimination, and the fragile position of a minority Brahmin family in a Limbu village. Dharani’s father’s mental turmoil and eventual death add a haunting layer of realism, while family conflicts—including his brother’s elopement with a Limbu girl (the graceful Parikxya)—deepen the emotional weight.  The final moments, when Dharani returns to the Magar shed searching for Phool and confronts the quiet aftermath of unresolved love and social divide, are devastatingly powerful.  And that line—   **“Ful haru muskaauchhan timile dekheko chhau ra? Putali le geet gauchhan timile suneko chhau ra?”**   —captures the soul of the film: poetic, painful, and profoundly human.|||Tyo gau ghar ko slow life herna chai kya ananda aayo tara story chai ekdam mid|||i watched it 2 days ago, great movie but at no point was i ever close to crying|||testo ramro xa ra,|||1st Nepali movie I watched in a theatre   Absolutely beautiful I would say|||lastai roye|||k bata hereko?|||Voli Hernu Parla|||https://msguides.com/windows-10|||Tin choti herisakey ajhai ni herna man xa.

            "body": "I am being honest and critical here. For those who genuinely want Nepal to become a better place and be recognized as a developed nation, we must acknowledge that we are critically failing. Lets start with history here, If we look at the result of Chitwan Constituency No. 1 in the 2079 election, our level of awareness becomes painfully clear. On one side stood Bishwanath Paudel — a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with experience in national and international policymaking, university teaching, advisory roles in institutions like the ILO, and currently serving as the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. On the other side stood Hari Dhakal, who represented rebellion and “newness,” despite not meeting the commonly accepted standards of excellence by which Paudel would normally be judged.  If competence, experience, knowledge, and contribution had truly been the criteria, the result should have been one-sided. But it was not. Dhakal won by a large margin, and Paudel finished third. This happened because people did not vote for a candidate; they voted out of anger toward old politics. Paudel did not lose because he lacked ability, but because he was seen as a symbol of the old party and of Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This reveals a deeper problem: our consciousness is only half-awakened. We are frustrated with the old parties and the system, yet we still fail to apply proper standards when choosing alternatives. We vote in anger, not with reason. We react, but we do not evaluate. Competence is not defined by a degree alone; it is built from education, knowledge, experience, contribution to policymaking, character, and integrity.  When a person with such qualifications loses solely because of party identity, it is not that person who loses — it is the country. Preventing capable individuals from losing elections is not an emotional demand; it is a demand of the time. A nation is built or destroyed not inside the ballot box, but inside the voter’s awareness. That awareness is not measured by speeches or slogans, but by the choices made during elections.  From now on, people must decide with judgment, not with the momentum of the crowd. They must judge with the mind, not with the anger of the heart. The day voters begin choosing candidates based on knowledge, ability, experience, character, and intention, opportunists will leave politics in shame, capable individuals will step forward naturally, and democracy will finally belong to the people.   Let us remember this: when good people begin to win, the nation never loses.",

Another one was one of the enforcer of alternative leaderships in politics, showed support to Balen and then became a founding member in RSP, which is the new ray of hope in Nepal today.

Remember you have to first take cancer out if it’s wildspreading - it shouldn’t matter if that makes your dick large - it should be cut off.  That’s what this election is. RSP choosing “popular faces” because they have to win this -  they are trying to pull samanupatik vote. Look at RSP people and how they behaved well previously. They raised issued, dare to speak which noone would have.  Now are they gods? No. But this is the time for new team to rise - not the old one.

Not just the party, not just the slogan, but the person. What have they done in the past? What do they stand for? How do they plan to speak for us in parliament?  Right now, we have MPs who show up only during elections. They ask for votes, promise everything, and once they win, they disappear. No contact, no accountability. That’s not representation.  I’m not saying every MP needs to be a Harvard graduate or some top expert. That’s not the point. Even someone who regularly talks with their voters, listens to their problems, raises local issues in parliament, and stays reachable would already be doing better than most.  Instead, many MPs start acting like they’re above the people once they get the title “माननीय.” They forget who gave them that title in the first place. A representative who forgets the people is not a representative at all.  Democracy isn’t about perfect leaders. It’s about leaders who remember who they work for.|||What would have happened if Bishwanath Paudel had won?

Like Gagan has said he wants to appoint people based on merit, but Can he do that when he has so many party members who will pressure him to give them appointment??  FYI.. RSP has no student or trade unions so far.     **3. Corruption investigations:** We know a lot of NC leaders have serious allegations of corruption. Even Gagan Thapa was forced to give ticket to Bijay Gacchadar who has been accused of corruption. So, Can we trust that he is gonna initiate corruption or other criminal investigations on various party members that may weaken his hold on the party??     These three reasons are enough for me not to vote for Gagan Thapa and his NC party this time around.",

Private Bills almost never pass in the parliament. You can bring bills but it will never pass unless ruling coalition and few other parties all collectively agree that it can be passed but with significant changes and compromise. Also there is party whip, you can disagree but never go against the party during parliamentary vote. You will get disciplined, ousted from the party and never get another chance.   That is fair criticism but did health insurance collapse under his leadership? I think consecutive government lack of funding and management also played a huge role. Personally I have benefited from the program. Also he did create legal, regulatory and financial structure for the program. It was a fragmented idea, but it did become concrete under his leadership and millions benefited from. Even if it collapsed but the framework is still there, it can be started again with some structural change and dont think the blame lies on Gagan on this one. There have been multiple other health ministers and multiple government after him whom each played a part in mismanagement.   Student politics is not necessarily bad. Also the history of student unions in Nepal is a bit different. Panchayat ma party nahuda, and lack of social media back then, the only way to organize politically was in universities and campuses. Also praya jasto sabai janta were illiterate back then, so politics was obviously only happening within educated circles, professors and students. The way gen z protest were organized in social media because people have access, navako vaye the only way would be to be form groups in school and colleges right? Natra kasari organize gartheu. Also before student politics sabai neta ko udpadan Indian university ma hunthyo, this did bring leadership opportunity inside Nepal. Also democratic society ma timile union ra group banaunai paudaina vannai mildaina. If me and few other RSP supporters want to make a club in my college for the upcoming election who can stop us? Also trade union ra bidhyathi sangathan navayera ta ho RSP le different ideology vako manche tara facebook follower ra celebrity status ko manche lai ticket badheko. They dont have an avenue of producing leaders who are ideologically aligned.   Also ticket badhne kura chai Nepali Congress ma dai ra vauju ko hat ma hunthyo. Party ko decision ra whip ma dai le j vannu hunthyo tei hunthyo. Party vitrai chai mahamantri vaye ni Gagan ko kei power lagdaina kina vane sabai decision central committee le majority ko adhar ma decision garcha ani central committee ma dai kai manche dherai sadhai usko majority. Kei garnai nasakine. Yo pali pani ticket was already distributed before the leadership change happened. So I do understand that new leadership did not have much time to finalize the tickets and he has admitted so too that there have been mistakes but the good thing is they passed a new set of laws regarding tickets during the mahaadhivesan. Starting next election the person will go through like a primary where NC members from a election region will elect who gets the ticket, savapati le sign gardai badhne din chai hatakai ho but logistically yo pali navyako vanya I think thats fair. Also there have been a lot of of other small structural and rules change that passed during mahaadhivesan that will have positive impact.

Even the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, they were able to rebuild the fastest after the earthquake from their own funds. There are also many other good initiates in Bhaktapur. Bijukchhe also gave up his MP seat to someone else in the party so that's good too. They have a lot of youth representatives running for election too, I think it's just behind RSP and certainly a lot ahead of Nepali Congress, UML, etc.  As for downsides, they do restrict some things in Bhaktapur, such as INGOs do not have the same access they do in other places. Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party. With the work they've done in their area, they could have promoted them and tried for more seats in other areas but they don't seem to put any efforts towards that, leaving them with extremely limited seats.   We know their MPs have mostly speak out in the parliament with a good voice. Although I think the impact is limited.|||They are limited to a specific area, mainly competing in Changunarayan and Bhaktapur municipalities. Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.|||Visited North Korea|||[Here's his interview with gorkhapatra](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010090943/http://gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=29063&cat_id=29)|||Ramro kam hatma ganna matra garna sakeko vayani naramro chai aaile samma gareko chaina...

Most people in those student unions, except for very few, do not have any political ideology at all; all they are able to say is we need to develop the country, have better education, health, employment, infrastructure, and whatnot. So why are they putting so much time and effort into politics?  Simple answer: they get to experience some power and money.  Sometime ago, in our department, the student union of UML threatened the chief to sign documents for tender regarding the purchase of computer equipment. Everything was recorded in video by the chief and we can clearly hear the chief saying it hasn't gone through the process and he doesn't know the quality and details of the purchase, and the response from the student leader was \"Ahile sir yaha kurchi kurchi uthayera hannu naparos...maile vanesi mannu na...sign garnus...tapailai paxi kei man parena vani hami saman nai change garamla....kei farak pardaina...ahile sign garnus...garo banaunu vayo vani hamlai ni garo huna aauxa...tauko tauko ma chair le hannu naparos.\" The campus chief signed. The video became viral over social media in our campus groups, Tribhuvan University asked for clarification, and that is all - no other action taken. The reason for making him sign the document? So that they can purchase lower-quality equipment and put extra money in their pocket.  This other story is of few years back, a professor who worked in USA finally returned to Nepal and he wanted to make a lab at Trichandra campus. When he didn't agree to give commission to NSU (Congress student union) while purchasing spectrometers, they grabbed the old-aged professor from campus and beat him on the road with their legs. This happened less than 300 meters from KTM Police, Ratnapark. He had to be admitted in ICU. And of course, the students got away with no consequences. I think they later told that the cause for beating was increasing college fee.  They also do some good work like speaking for students and speaking against bad decisions of campus administration but doing the comparison, it just feels like they just do the good works to hide their actual intentions. If they get commissions regularly, they stay silent but when they don't get money, they start protesting. Most importantly, they are not hesitant to be violent as they know if they get arrested, it will be for a short period of time, and the police will release them after political pressure. I remember a few UML students even beat up police on dress while drunk a few months ago.  They also slowly transition to national politics and this is what they want to do later on. They want to show as if they are doing works but the only reason is to get commissions.  And this is true not only for these two student unions, it is also true for most of the political associations, including those of professors, students, and employees. Every group forms a political association, and in order for everyone on a committee to agree on something, they have to receive something, leaving not enough money for actual works. This is why we have low quality stuffs, and this is why things take so long to be done. This is why they are able to afford good lifestyle without job being student for decades. Remove the money and freedom to be 'gangster who doesn't get intervened by police' from equation and I wonder how many students will be left in those student unions",

            "comments": "Really need to ban all this student unions.|||True. I have heard similar things from my friends. We have to get NSU and ANNFSU out of our education system.   If you believe Gangan’s “Naya party” Congress will move to ban these student unions. Congrats you failed. RSP doesn’t have any unions yet and Sumana tried to get these unions out last time as well.|||I also have closely seen students unions and their functioning over a sustained period of time and the thug activities that they perform are undeniable. The political culture and the intent of a lot of those members of student unions are there just for the power exercise as you say. They have been very bad and might continue to be bad. I have had worst possible experience from those unions personally too, so I am not vouching for these activities and completely agree the lawlessness they tend to follow.  But in principle I do think that they have some good purpose to serve, if done properly. I think there are two ways about it:   1. Because they are bad, let's ban them willy nilly.   2. They are bad, but they serve  good purpose in general, so lets think about possibly improving them.  The first one seems easy way out, lets work to ban them altogether. But how? Do we ban students getting together and discussing? What if they don't explicitly say they are party association, the association isn't something that you can prove. Beause unionization, we think,  is something a democracy should allow, does banning them amount to restricting democratic right? This could be a slippery slope and we might never be able to pin point a boundary for them to unionize and associate with some political party, because in principle we can't ban having political viewpoint.     The second seems a bit more ideal. We want to weight in the possible cons compared to the pros that they offer. And, I think if done well, the pros have something good to offer. So in principle I wouldn't ban unionization (students or otherwise). If we have strong criminal prosecution and strong adherence to laws of campus (in case of student unions), we can improve situation a lot. I think that thuggery is not unique to unions but is prevalent in more areas of society and we can't ban them all. Its just the reflection of society and some campus can control  them more some don't.      I have also seen some very good deeds done by the student unions personally, across different student unions. And at times, I have been impressed by what can be achieved by the unionization of student, if done with correct motive.      And lets get real, no one is going to ever ban any sort of unionization be it students or workers or else in a democracy. I have some people think RSP would ban them; they won't.|||Thank you and this presence of student unions in our public education system is a huge problem and if any party can decrease their influence then it is RSP which has no student unions. Gagan led NC won’t do it because he believes in such unions.",

            "body": "Posting this as a warning for anyone considering a custom wedding sari in Nepal, especially if you’re traveling from abroad.  I deliberately chose a boutique and paid significantly more—when a ready-made piece would have been cheaper—because I wanted quality and believed I could trust a reputable boutique. I placed a custom order at Dreamwear Fashions - by Manju Dhakal (Kupondole), provided details and reference photos, and was assured they could deliver exactly what I requested within my timeline.  When I went to pick it up, the sari was completely different from what I had ordered. The workmanship and design did not match the references at all. They offered to “fix” it, but the work was already so poorly done that I had no confidence they could correct it, especially with my flight the next day.  Under pressure and with no real alternatives, I had no choice but to choose a completely different ready made outfit that they had in stock—one I hadn’t planned or envisioned for my wedding.  Despite not delivering the commissioned piece, the owner refused any discount or compensation, claiming the original design was “not in style” and a “wasted piece\" on their end.  Now that I’ve had time to process this, it’s deeply upsetting—not just because the money is gone, but because I lost the wedding outfit I had carefully planned and trusted them to create. I’m sharing this as a caution to others, and would appreciate any advice on whether there’s anything I can still do (already left a Google review), especially since I’m no longer in Nepal.",

Blind support kills accountability and slowly turns politics into fandom. Support ideas, question everyone, even the ones you like.   DISCLAIMER:  I'm a non-partisan 34yo male, still trying to make it here, without going abroad.  FULL:  This isn’t about left or right, or any one party.        It’s just something I’ve noticed over the years, especially in Nepal.        Whenever a politician starts getting hardcore, die-hard supporters, things tend to go wrong sooner or later. Not instantly, not dramatically, but slowly. Power plus blind loyalty is a bad mix.        Problem ke ho bhane, we stop treating politicians like public servants and start treating them like heroes. Ani hero banepachi, normal criticism pani disrespect jasto lagna thalcha. Question garyo bhane hater, anti-party, anti-nation bhandincha.        But politicians ta job apply garera aayeka hun. They made promises, we voted based on those promises. If they actually deliver, that’s good. Tara tyo kaam gareko ma puja garnu parne hoina. That was already expected when we elected them.         I’m not saying don’t appreciate good work. Acknowledge results, give credit where it’s due. Just don’t turn people into gods. Once that happens, accountability slowly disappears. Galti bhayeni justify garincha, “at least aru bhanda ramro cha” becomes the excuse for everything, and loyalty matters more than competence.        At that point, politics stops being about policies and starts feeling like fandom. And fandoms are terrible at admitting when they’re wrong.        Support ideas, not personalities. Question even the people you like. Critical hunu ko matlab hate garnu hoina. In a democracy, we’re supposed to be citizens, not fans.       Just sharing how I see it.

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section.

Impressive that you have published in your undergraduates. Finally, good luck and keep applying 🤞|||dont you think DS projects are very beginner level? i am in 12th rn and i have dont projects like these too so|||You are good to go, however you have added some naive projects (can't judge, but as you havent mentioned anything unique those are some basic stuffs). Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it. Add some numbers: In your internship part, try to mention a % improvement or a specific result. \"Built a model\" sounds okay, but \"Boosted accuracy by 15%\" sounds like a pro.|||[deleted]|||If you're  starting make it one page not 2|||Limit it to 1 page.

The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

But the fact is, If the system is huge, there will be lot of moving point (logic), many time what to do how to solve this problem is not clear , there are lot of edge case the we have to think, test. As human we remember what we did yesterday, past month we can think and recall but AI is not aware of any think, unless we told explicitly tell is what to do. So, Ai is just a tool(powerful what, if you know when and how to use it).  So, don't think about the outcome just learn, focus on the foundation, learn the basic, try to do hard think your self, use ai to learn new concept not to code in the beginning, give yourself a chance to make mistakes and correct later. Choose any language (py/NodeJS/Goland) DSA, OOP, OS, DBMS, CN. Learn any framework, the path and way will itself be clear after you start moving forward. Hope this Help.|||I can only imagine what it must be like to be a junior today. AI is bringing so much change, it's completely unprecedented. At my corporate setting, we generate code, that used to take 4 devs 6 months to write, in just a few days. Spending time coding solo in the flow like in the old days, now feels stupid, almost as ridiculous as someone coding in a text editor instead of IDE. That being said, the quality of code that LLM generate is direct result of how well you understand your problem. If you know how to breakdown the problem, the algorithm to use, applicable design pattern, test strategy, potential performance bottleneck, the quality of code that comes up is just amazing.  It's looking like newcomers need to directly think like an architect instead of code punchers.|||Start from Js. Learn basics and some higher order function then jump into mernstack|||We are in a phase where some companies are planning to cut employees by utilizing AI, some have already done so and some even have started rehiring because Excessive use of AI created even more problems. Some jobs are definitely going to be cut but might not be as dire as people are saying. Let's see what unfolds. Within two to three years things will start to get clearer|||if AI is helping you that good. Why dont you dig in whats makes AI underneath so powerful. What sorts of architecture and infrastructure enabled researchers to make LLM. That would be your best starting point which will not only empower you but also make you job ready as there will be lot of LLM engineers demand in the future.|||you aren't paid to write code, you are paid to solve problems.   AI just helps you do it quicker.|||Tech ma coding matra hunna. Coding will largely be automated which will bring down development costs.

I know it's wrong that people have to work so stressfully but that's what people signed up for, some things need to be forced.  A less extreme example would be your local transport department DMV, everyone decides it's their right to leave and they all exercise their right when it's the peak season at the end of a financial year and no one can pay their taxes, who will be impacted.  So, yeah in some places especially in the public sector where it's about public welfare, leaves should never be a right.",

I don't know what works anymore. On the flip side it seems like more and more work is getting outsourced as the skill of people outside of the western countries have started to level up and with AI it seems like people everywhere are going to level up massively or equally.  What I see is crucial for the future is AI literacy, being able to leverage coding agents and be productive with it. But from my experience you need experience building applications to have good intuition with these AI agents. So if I was to give advice to people who want to stay in this field learn system design, architecture and build projects to implement them. Don't one shot applications/project. Build something complicated enough with these coding agents that you are forced to review the code, and if something feels unmaintainable learn to drive these agents in a way that you understand what you are building. And if you want to really stand out just build in public X, YouTube, tik tok but easier said than done cause us engineers by default are introverted. Just know that it's not you the market is just brutal, less hiring AI fear mongering holding new hires.  I spend too time in the X AI bubble so might not relate but this is where I see things heading. Maybe AI will be the level up that will bring more jobs to countries like ours so if I have hedge my bets it will be coding agents, system designs and building your own stuff.  It's one of the worst time to be a software engineer and also one of the best time both are true chose which reality you want to pick.",

Despite being independent, Balen was able to work with them and produce results.   Now Balen has whole RSP behind him and he can be even more effective.   Arko most important thing is no corruption allegations against Balen.|||https://preview.redd.it/dwlm7a9sv0gg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6235b0fc08dcc9d98fb462fc1373baa63f7c92b5  Dont say anything else this didi will cry that balen did nothing|||The works mentioned aren’t very much transformative and these works are done by most of the mayors across the country. Here’s point wise breakdown of things he has done that are more media boosted to show fairytale: 1. Scholarships: there was an existing rule that all private schools should give 10% scholarships to poor and talented students. I don’t deny some of schools tried to not meet 10% quota as the law but balen hasn’t done that all by himself. 2. Book free fridays are a good initiative from him and a new concept that students should focus on different aspects rather than only books. I like this decision of him. 3. Student lunch of rs25 is given from municipalities across nepal and it is mandated by local laws and noone can give less than 25 but they can increase based on spending capacity of the local government. So this is not the magical thing only he has done it is an automatic process by law. 4. Hospital beds: same story as scholarships, 10% beds should be subsidized according the law. He hasn’t done it but the existing laws have done, however the concern is some of the hospitals try to skip this csr. It is also implemented in most of the local governments across nepal. 5. He has done a good job to keep waste out of the city but as mentioned in this post “recycling “ as he had agenda to produce electricity upto 5MW from waste daily. Where is the electricity or a recycling plant? All the waste are dumped into banchare danda which effects severly to locals and their health. He fould have done better! 6. Tukucha and other rivers: there was a lot of hype arond these, but he just broke some infrastructure and left. No any restoration or pretective progress around those broken infrastructure. Such damaged infrastructure affects local residents in their daily life what about that? Could have done better! 7. He has built some falchas which look good! But the catch is the issue that came up with the amount of budget used to make falchas. There was a news that a falcha was made out of about 60 lakhs? He hasn’t clarified anything regarding this also. I agree heritage works are expensive but how was the tender process gone? As much i know mostly mahanagar handed out contracts directly without tender/bidding processes. It’s a grey zone for corruption and I can’t defend him in this context.  8. A very good work of him is retaining the encroached lands!! It was a vote bank for communists from a long time and noone could dare touching those sukumbasis and he dared. However he faced a lot of backlash but I appreciate his work in this matter. 9. He has managed parking and footpaths well! But the footpaths claim aren’t much visible on ground as claimed to be 250 places. It’s mostly around newroad and other areas still have narrow or no footpaths. It’s a media manufactured noise so he could have done better. 10. New busparks? Really? Where are the new busparks? Please enlighten me anyone. 11. Street lights: it’s not a huge number a mentioned in the post as ktm city is very big compared to these number and he could have done better! However he has installed some fire hydrants in inaccessible places which is very admirable. Also he had promised to install cctv across ktm while election campaigns, he could have done that at least  a pilot project in some places?  12. Digital: his live meetings is appreciable as transparency however it’s more of his favorable thing as he could have faced pressure inside a room full of oldies! Now he’s not facing any media or questions ?   Conclusion His delivery is below average than most municipalities in the country. However some of the efforts are genuinely impressive but most of the needed works can’t be done in his tenure. As ktm has budget of 25 arba+ yearly it couldn’t invest/spend a bare minimum of 25% each year! It’s far beyond national spending which is around 38%. He could have done better! For the present context he should face media do debates and present his idea of development and plans for it to the public. Everyone should be accountable and noone is”GOD”  This was a critical analysis of balen shah’s mayoral tenure.|||This too when the whole system was against him  Top dheki bottom kasaile kaam garna didaina thiye|||Actually hamlai physical development vanda pani suru ma policy level ma changes ra existing rules ko implementation chaiyeko cha!|||102 ko ambulance was a great help .

Him reclaiming public property and the waste management is way better. But he still underdelivered on a lot of his campaign promises. Kathmandu still remains one of the most polluted city in the world and he did nothing to help improve that. He promised improvements to the public transport, but didn't do anything. There are dozens of other promises like more accessible public toilets, improving drainage system, roads, environments, etc all of which he fell short on. I understand that not all of the campaign promises can always be achieved. But the problem is that he has such a cult of personality that people act like he's beyond questioning. And that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope that he wins, we're long overdue on big leadership changes. These old corrupt politicians have to be weeded out and Balen feels like a best opportunity to do that. But when he wins, I hope people start holding him accountable to his duties and his words. Otherwise, we'll just be repeating the same cycle.|||Let's not still try to hype him more than he deserves. This man has done things that no one dared to do but everything that he did was very ground-level stuff that the public can easily see and praise him for. It is understandable to try and make changes while you have the authority so I do give him the benefit of the doubt. If he does win this election and does things that can really paint a picture for a better future for Nepal then I'll be convinced that we have finally found a leader. Until then I would like to be skeptical. I do not want to give myself up to the idea of him being the perfect leader for our country, I do not want to grow up with this fantastical image of him in my mind and turn into a blind follower like much of the oldies. I admire him and his attempts but nothing that has actually won me over. Still better than anyone else though.|||What is did is not the question. The question is how many promises he implemented. The work listed here are some done by central government. He did the work for creating contradiction. I have not seen anything that is sustainable. Of being a mayor of the biggest metropolitan city people have expected much more.|||Balen is one of those rare leaders who didn’t come from the usual political pipeline and that’s exactly why people trust him. He speaks straight, works on the ground, and isn’t afraid to upset powerful interests if it means doing the right thing. Whether it’s cleaning up Kathmandu, enforcing rules equally, or calling out corruption, he leads with action more than words. You may agree or disagree with some decisions, but you can’t deny his courage, independence, and intent to change the system rather than benefit from it…he may not be perfect, but he is the best among the current political leaders.|||Tyo education ko each and every point already existing chij ho sarkar le nai dinxa Lunch money ta..

And after some time, I heard some sound, you know that \"plyat plyat\" sound.  Now, the surprising thing is it was not even that private, the cabin had no doors anyone could walk in any moment. I stayed until they came outside, I was shocked they were plus 2 or 10 class students in college/school dress. I mean doing such thing, in somewhat public space with no fear.  I mean wtf. Is this normal today? Doing that at a young age and in a unsafe place like that? I even coughed and knocked the table to let them know that someone was noticing, but no they kept going.  They looked like Madhesi, I am not being racist here but anyone else would be too scared to do that shit in public. I mean go find a room if you are that desperate or go to some cave idk .  Edit: Watching possible minors engage in that behavior in a public space shouldn't be traumatizing? No wonder there’s something deeply wrong with today’s society.     Edit 2: I didn't realize while writing this, \"Trauma\" maybe is a very heavy word. I was deeply shocked, but I recognize that using the word “traumatized” can diminish the weight of real trauma, which isn’t what I intend. Cheers and lmao",

The US-EU tiff over Greenland isn't just about a \"big piece of ice\"—it’s a desperate grab for the rare earth minerals that will power the next century of AI and EVs. When the US threatens 25% tariffs on Germany and France over a land deal, the old \"Allies\" playbook is officially dead. Where does this leave Nepal? We’re the \"Yam\" between two boulders that are suddenly moving much faster. Our $20B reserve is a solid war chest, but it’s sitting in a currency that’s being weaponized. If you want to understand the 2026 vibe, look at the Tariff Tussle: we are moving from a world of \"cheap global goods\" to \"expensive local security.\" For Nepal, the goal is simple but brutal: don't choose a side, sell electricity to whoever pays in hard assets, and pray our \"Non-Alignment\" holds while the giants fight over the Arctic and the Dollar",

There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section. Make the about me section more personalized. Tailor both to the job. As a former academic I value latex skills but you don't need to mention zotero as a skill.  Impressive that you have published in your undergraduates. Finally, good luck and keep applying 🤞|||dont you think DS projects are very beginner level? i am in 12th rn and i have dont projects like these too so|||You are good to go, however you have added some naive projects (can't judge, but as you havent mentioned anything unique those are some basic stuffs). Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it. Add some numbers: In your internship part, try to mention a % improvement or a specific result. \"Built a model\" sounds okay, but \"Boosted accuracy by 15%\" sounds like a pro.|||[deleted]|||If you're  starting make it one page not 2|||Limit it to 1 page.

The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.

Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype. Otherwise, we risk mistaking short-term popularity for genuine leadership|||Balen will win for sure |||सबका सब हामीलाई वेवकुफ बनाईरहेछ… बाले भाईले पनि बनायो।|||Isnt RSP against provincial system.|||But wtf is he saying ? 😭",

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Isn't that really obvious though?|||Thats like asking, “Was Jesus a christian?”. Jesus was born as a Jew, but later promoted his own teachings. Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

That said, Plenty of Nepali immigrants, their kids, etc. are pissed as hell about it and are pushing back in what capacity they can.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||This is projection.  He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run.

So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot.

Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity.

Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system.

And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section. Make the about me section more personalized. Tailor both to the job. As a former academic I value latex skills but you don't need to mention zotero as a skill.  Impressive that you have published in your undergraduates. Finally, good luck and keep applying 🤞|||dont you think DS projects are very beginner level? i am in 12th rn and i have dont projects like these too so|||You are good to go, however you have added some naive projects (can't judge, but as you havent mentioned anything unique those are some basic stuffs). Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it. Add some numbers: In your internship part, try to mention a % improvement or a specific result. \"Built a model\" sounds okay, but \"Boosted accuracy by 15%\" sounds like a pro.|||[deleted]|||If you're  starting make it one page not 2|||Limit it to 1 page.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

It will open multiple doors for you not just one country and programme which you are doing rn, Germany vayena vane k garnu type hudaina. Also try and apply as much scholarship opportunities you can find over the internet like DAAD, Hungarium Stipendum, Denish Govt Scholarishp and many more out there, if you are good in essay writting, some ECA in your school time, good social profile like involving and working in Rotaracts or Red Cross, good spoken English, can attend interview then you have very high chance that you can get good scholarship opportunity. Same time try countries like ITALY or Austria where you can get free undergrad programmes in Public unis (dont go to consultancy 8-10lakh lutchan). Keep hopes, manifest your plan, and start woking on it. Good luck.",

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",
