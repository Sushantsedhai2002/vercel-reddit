Maybe international forces too, creating proxies.|||The real question is who will you vote for in uncoming election? You don't support RSP.   Somebody has to form a new party, then organize and expansion on all 77 districts within 4-5 months. This is highly difficult task.  So I think it's better to vote for their enemy, whoever it may be.

Haha  Jokes aside, I do believe the presence of RSP/Ravi is very heavy on the internet and does not necessarily mean the 'cyber-sena'. It could simply be because most of their supporters happen to be relatively younger and fluent on social media. Just like the Gen-Zs.   The online presence is far from the real votes on the ground. Otherwise, you could expect RSP, or Balen, or GenZ, or any new forces to win the majority of the votes, which sadly is a distant dream for now.|||It's very easy to tell whether they were bots or not.

While they may be *better* than others, the main point is that they can't survive against other parties' well-established forces if they don't have one of their own.  They simply can't sustain themselves against the cyber operations of the established parties.  Let me share an incident with you all. I'm friends with a current or former RSP Member of Parliament (*samsad*), and he literally invited me to like a specific Facebook page‚ÄîI think he did it by mistake. I checked out that page, and what I found was a newly created, fresh page named **\"Gen Z Sunsari.\"** That page is now continuously promoting Ravi Lamichhane and his colleagues.  Let me be clear: I support the RSP, and I think it's a **good thing** that they have a cyber sena. If they don't, they're cooked for sure. Oli, Deuba, and Prachanda all have massive cyber armies and huge amounts of money to distribute, often hidden away in the homes of various party workers (*karyakarta*).  The RSP needs to fight fire with fire to survive and thrive.But I think Facebook and tiktok is better place to let your sena attack then here|||Mah RSP ko supporter ho ra ahile samma ta maile kunai cyber senas related to RSP dekhya xna even in Facebook, Facebook.

They didn't protest when student were killed now they are protesting for no sense.|||Nepal‚Äôs protest scene right now is basically history looping on fast-forward ‚Äî a country that keeps mistaking personalities for progress. First it was KP Oli, turned from an opportunistic power player into a ‚Äúnationalist hero‚Äù for waving a map, then Prachanda, once a Maoist warlord, now a coalition juggler who mastered the art of survival politics, and now the new ‚Äúhope fever‚Äù is Balen, the cool-haired mayor rebranded as the savior of the youth ‚Äî same pattern, new face, same circus. Everyone‚Äôs hyped on change until the next disappointment lands. Beneath the noise, 27% of Nepal‚Äôs GDP comes from remittance, one of the highest ratios in South Asia, which means the country literally runs on the sweat of its absent citizens ‚Äî millions of young people leaving because the only thing booming at home is rhetoric. The impact is brutal: hollowed-out workforce, dependence on Gulf economies, and a generation whose idea of reform is tweeting from abroad. So when protests erupt, they‚Äôre less about revolution and more like emotional flashbacks ‚Äî a mix of frustration, misplaced hope, and d√©j√† vu politics, where the stage changes but the script stays the same.|||Felt uneasy from a day Sudan gave interview in Al Jazeera, that shit was disturbing and sounded authoritarian.

Do you really think new parties and new faces in the government can end corruption under this same system?  The same system which rewards corruption and exploitation and discourages honesty and hard work?  Do you think only the politicians are corrupted?  We need to change the whole system.  We need to flip it upside down.  We need to make people the decision makers and representatives and the government implementation agencies of our decision. Not the other way around.  Isn‚Äôt that the real meaning of democracy? For, by and to the people?  What we have right now is just another glorified form of slavery. Politicians and oligarchs make rule for us and we have to obey them.  Exploitation is bound to happen. Corruption is bound to happen. It is the characteristic of this system, not the exception.  People ask why do communists exist. It is because fascists exist. Harder they oppress us, harder we will resist.  Like ying to the yang, when oppression happens there will be people who will naturally resist it.  Gen-Zs revolted for the same reason. They just didn‚Äôt have the name for it. Now they are lost.

First, do not vote for Nepali Congress or UML or Maoist party even if they have a youth candidate because those youth MPs if elected will have to obey their party chairs who will mostly be same old politicians.   Second, look for next alternative. If we have a Balen led or Balen supported or a good Youth led party formed by Sudhan Gurung even then look at their agenda and you can vote for them, this is best case scenario and hopefully it will happen. However, if this doesn't happen and you are not okay with Sudhan gurung led party then yes Rastriya swotantra party is one of your choices. You can vote for anyone you like but also remember to vote where it matters.   So, let's wait. There is still time for a new youth led party.|||Chunab nai hunna|||[removed]|||aba khai tin tauke lai ta dine haina aba party naya banyo balen or respected person leh then dine ho natra RSP bahek aru koi dekhdina khai aru baneka party haru ki party futera banya xan ki tin tauke kai party xan",

            "body": "Was randomly reading up on what Gagan Thapa actually did when he was Health Minister (2016‚Äì17), and honestly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs wild how much he tried to change. Not just the usual press conferences and slogans, dude was actually building systems.  Here‚Äôs the breakdown üëá  # Tried to make health insurance real:He pushed a National Health Insurance Bill and even piloted it in a few districts. The idea was simple, no one should go broke because they got sick. It didn‚Äôt go fully national, but it was a proper start.  # Hospital pharmacies = cheap meds: Made government hospitals open their own pharmacies where medicines cost about half of what you‚Äôd pay outside. Rolled out in 60+ hospitals. Massive win for regular patients.  # Drafted a bunch of actual law like 20 different policies and bills, Health Insurance, Drug Act amendments, Liquor Policy, Disability Policy, Reproductive Health Bill, etc. Basically gave the ministry a structure instead of just ‚Äúwe‚Äôll figure it out later.‚Äù  He made kidney transplants free for poor patients. Also publicly called out the nonsense of politicians using taxpayer money for treatment abroad. Straight up said ‚Äúfix our hospitals instead.‚Äù  # Health system for federal Nepal: While everyone was confused about who does what under federalism, he actually started mapping responsibilities... federal, provincial, local. Bureaucratic? Sure. But it‚Äôs how real systems are built.  # Planned to hire 3,000+ doctors and bring in billions worth of medical equipment. Didn‚Äôt hit every number, but at least there was a plan.  # Talked about electronic medical records, biometric systems, and data-driven healthcare when most hospitals were still using paper files.  # Called out corruption & elite privilege: Spoke up about procurement scams, pushed for transparency, and went after the ‚ÄúVIPs get free flights abroad for treatment‚Äù culture. Didn‚Äôt fix everything, but at least he wasn‚Äôt pretending it didn‚Äôt exist.  Gagan‚Äôs time as minister was probably one of the few times the ministry looked like it had a vision. Less ribbon-cutting, more system-building. Didn‚Äôt fix everything, but the direction was solid.  If that same energy had continued for five more years, our healthcare would look way less tragic today.",

            "heading": "Balen: complete character sketch (please add what you know)",
            "body": "# Background  * Full name: Balendra S\\*\\*h, popularly known as¬†**Balen**. * Born 27 April 1990 in Kathmandu. * Education: Bachelor‚Äôs in civil engineering (Nepal) and Master‚Äôs in structural engineering (VTU, Karnataka, India) * Pre‚Äêpolitical career: active in Nepal‚Äôs hip-hop / rap / Nephop scene (lyrics often dealing with corruption, social issues) * In 2022, ran as an independent candidate for mayor of Kathmandu and won, becoming the first independent in that role * His campaign promise included: waste management, road traffic control, anti-corruption, public service delivery, and heritage/urban improvement.  Thus, Balen carries both a technocratic engineering identity and a cultural/activist identity from music, giving him a hybrid persona of ‚Äúengineer + activist‚Äù in the public mind.  # Observable Traits  From his track record and public behavior, some traits emerge:  |Trait / Quality|Evidence / Examples|Notes| |:-|:-|:-| || |**Bold / confrontational**|He has taken stances against powerful institutions: e.g. banned Indian films in Kathmandu over cultural/cinematic objections (the ‚ÄúAdipurush‚Äù issue), placing a ‚ÄúGreater Nepal‚Äù map in his office, publicly accusing courts/government of being under Indian influence.|These bold moves enhance visibility and signal willingness to challenge norms. But some critics see them as symbolic or populist gestures.| |**Anti-establishment**|Running as an independent, taking on conventional party structures; pushing for urban cleanup, demolishing illegal constructions, revealing riverbeds (e.g. Tukucha River project) as part of city beautification.|Reformist posture helps him appeal to disillusioned voters, especially youth. But the challenges of implementation are large and he hasn't lived up to all promises.| |**Selective engagement**|Though public, he maintains a relatively low profile operational style: many say meeting him is difficult, he avoids unnecessary public events, and delegates day-to-day tasks to a core team of around 30 people.|This suggests he prefers control via inner circle and avoids overexposure, which could limit accountability.| |**Strong on symbolism and narrative**|He uses symbolic acts to send messages: e.g. maps, bans, public posts. He speaks directly (on social media) to Gen Z, urging them to ‚Äúbe patient‚Äù or to not rush government formation.|Symbolic politics is a double-edged sword: it energizes supporters but can be criticized as surface-level if not backed by concrete change.| |**Ideologically nationalistic**|His stance on ‚ÄúGreater Nepal,‚Äù his criticism of Indian influence, controversies around Indian films, and insistence on cultural respect reflect a nationalist posture.|Such stances can rally nationalist sentiment but risk diplomatic tension or overreach.| |**Tension between idealism and execution**|Some policy initiatives (e.g. waste segregation) have been critiqued as rushed or symbolic without adequate infrastructure.|This tension is common in reformist leaders: bold proposals meet messy ground in implementation.| |**Populist communication**|He makes regular public statements via social media, using emotive appeals, calling for patience or urging restraint.|This style helps him maintain popularity and bypass intermediaries, but may sometimes oversimplify complex issues.| |**Selective accountabilitt**|Because he avoids many public-facing meetings and increasingly works through a core team, his decision-making process is somewhat opaque to the general public.|That opacity can feed criticism about lack of transparency.| |**Courage / risk tolerance**|He has risked legal and political backlash (e.g. contempt petitions when defying court orders over film screening) rather than back away immediately.|Risk-taking can inspire supporters but also create vulnerabilities.|  Thus, Balen emerges as a figure characterized by boldness, symbolic politics, nationalism, impatience with status quo, and a practical streak, but also tensions around how deeply reforms are institutionalized and whether his bold gestures will match sustainable governance.  Therefore,  * He is¬†a hybrid figure: partly engineer-administrator, partly activist / symbolic leader. He blends a technocratic sensibility with cultural resonance. * He sees urban governance and municipal leadership as arenas for visible reform and challenge to the status quo. He tends to prefer bold, visible acts (demolition, bans, confrontation) to slow incremental acts. * He cares about symbolism, narrative, identity, national dignity and not just service delivery. In many moves, the messaging is as important as practical effect. * But he also faces the classic test for political outsiders: can he transition from protester style to sustainable governance? Can he build institutions, deliver services, maintain legitimacy, and balance competing pressures?",

I can‚Äôt diagnose you but our family has multiple  members who experience these same symptoms.  They are called intrusive thoughts and the anxiety around having to respond to them is called a compulsion.  First off, everyone has thoughts and feelings like this.  But when they start to disrupt your life it it can become quite painful and debilitating.  It sounds like anxiety and possibly OCD/ obsessive compulsive disorder.  The good news is that it very treatable.  The gold standard is ssri medication and ERP therapy which is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy.  There are resources available online if you can‚Äôt find help where you are or don‚Äôt feel comfortable.

But make sure is only meditation nothing else|||Overthinking is a common thing at this age. It's not just you, it happens to many people at your age.  First, stop generalizing it because you don't always forget. For example, you did not forget to put on your shoes when you left, or you did not forget to put on your pants. You don't pay attention to the good things that are happening, and you focus more on the bad things. That's the problem.  But the truth is alwase exactly the opposite. Compared to the good things that are happening, the bad things are very small, in a 90/10 ratio or even less. We magnify them by paying too much attention to them and repeating them over and over again, and then generalize it further, believing that this is always the case.  This constant forgetting, and being tormented by the fear of forgetting, is not you, it is just your habit. Habits can be changed.   What to do:  1. The first thing to do is stop generalizing. This isn't always happening, it's only happening sometimes.  2. Give equal importance to what you're doing well and remember it often. What will this do? Your self-confidence will grow.  3. Make this resolution in your mind, repeat it over and over like a mantra. \"I am alert and always remain alert.\" Repeat it whenever you remember. If you're alone, say it out loud. If you're among people, say it silently.  You'll see results within a month. If you need more help, you can DM me. I'm your friend. You'll get everything you could expect from a true friend. üôèüíê|||I used to have this, what helped me was working in customer service which forced me to learn active listening and being detail oriented. I was really bad at my job at first but the fear of failing forced me to learn being present in the moment. Noticing what is happening around me at all times.   The downside is I get drained and I need a-lot of alone time once I spent the whole day doing this. But you just re-charge by resting and letting your brain imagine away when you are alone.   I would recommend meditation just like the others have but also engage with your surroundings when you‚Äôre not home, only go into deep thinking in a safe comfortable environment.   Trust me this is not a curse but a blessing, most people can‚Äôt think deeply but you have to train yourself to learn how to control it.",

            "body": "Lately, a heavy thought has been pressing on me: why am I so scared to love someone, yet constantly craving to be loved? I‚Äôve been fighting depression for the past couple of years and have been in counselling for about a year now. When I shared my thoughts with my counsellor, she said something that struck me, that I protect myself so much that I make decisions for people before they ever get the chance to know me. I convince myself they‚Äôll hate me once they see how broken I am, both mentally and physically, so I leave before they can say a word. When I talk to someone new and start feeling that something real might be building, I look in the mirror and see the chaos I‚Äôve made of my life. Then I think, how could someone like me ever deserve to be loved, cared for, or even asked how I‚Äôm doing? I tell myself I‚Äôm not doing right by that person, that I‚Äôm only wasting both our time.  And when the fear sets in, the fear that maybe she really will like me but will walk away once she truly knows me, I shut down. I convince myself she deserves someone better, someone stronger, someone who isn‚Äôt as damaged as I am. There are so many better options out there, and I tell myself that people like me shouldn‚Äôt expect love or closeness. Yet deep down, I‚Äôm terrified of being alone. I know I‚Äôm loyal and honest; I‚Äôve never betrayed anyone. But every time I open up to someone new, believing this time will be different, it ends the same way, being left behind, told I‚Äôm good to be around for a while, but never good enough to stay with forever.  Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm fading away, like I‚Äôm here but not really alive. I keep breathing, eating, laughing, even making fun of myself, but inside I feel empty, as if the real me disappeared long ago. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, this quiet ache that follows me everywhere. I‚Äôm just tired-tired of hoping, tired of pretending, tired of feeling like I‚Äôm not enough for anyone, not even for myself.",

Actually you don't even need to ask this question, every human has a purpose: to keep living on‚Äîeither survive with eternal lifespan or reproduction. Aba purpose tw thaha bhae halyo, what should you do? Live in the best way your current self can understand and afford. See you got the purpose(to live) and for being more specific you also got a goal(make the best out of the your life).  It sounds like we are back to starting point as you're kind of asking how to live. You don't need to know more either, people are just bored so they just keep adding complexities to pass their time. Purpose of human life is simple, just live.  Arko bhayo job ko kura. For getting a job you need: skills to do the job, way to let people know that you have these skills and they can trust you with that job, and reason for them to choose you over others(it could be your skills, your popularity, your relationship with them, etc).  But what if my efforts of learning all these skills are wasted? If you're really skilled, any outdated tech skills will still get you job in right places. That aside, if you're not really passionate about something beforehand, then sikney bhanera kasari choose garney? Let's understand this with holi tshirt and casual tshirt analogy. You cannot start producing holi tshirt off-season 'cause you saw good sales of holi tshirt in holi season. But if you know there will be demand of holi tshirt, then it might be good idea to start producing holi tshirt before holi season. Also, if you can know there is a demand of holi tshirt during holi season, you should only print them if you can produce and make them reach customer on time. Otherwise, it's better to focus on casual tshirt production.  Aru tw problem timi lai chear nai xa, and you also know what to do about them. For assistance, you can take help of professional therapists that help with these problems.",

The three top politicians i.e prachanda, kp oli and sher bahadur deuba tend to do pretty much everything well stabilized though the rate of development was pretty slow.  Last time Prachanda's government under the support of UML(ig) was doing a tremendous good job. There were even multiple reports that hinted the arrest of Aarju Deuba in the near future. However, when the bhutanese refugee case reached upto that level. The government changed overnight. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  All of a sudden every cases were dismantled. The congress who were previously raising voice against R. Lamichane and G. B Rai about sahakari kanda didnt even cared about it anymore.

Gives the Foreign Ministery to Aarju Deuba who was just few days ago the major headlines of newspaper about her probable home arrest.  The AIG Thapa was transferred and another new AIG was brought who is believed to be linked to UML. And tadaaaaa,  The ANSFU (student union of UML) didnt stand with the Gen-Z protest as even they were an student union standing for the good governace, Democracy. Yet, when the voices araise for there leaders arrest not out of no where you find them raising issues againt it.

When I was born, the royal massacre had just happened. By the time I grew up and started understanding things, the monarchy was already gone.  Most of us Gen Zs have never actually experienced life under a constitutional monarchy. So, how are we forming thoughts, assumptions, and opinions about the King?  Because what I notice is whenever the word ‚ÄúKing‚Äù comes up, almost every Gen Z immediately says ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  Have today‚Äôs political leaders somehow manipulated the youths who never got to experience the monarchy?  We‚Äôve lived through multi-party democracy ‚Äî so we can make our own opinions about this system based on experience. But when it comes to the monarchy, are our views really our own, or are they influenced?  Just an independent thought.

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

            "body": "I need to vent about those cringe NPC-type people who just wannabe something they‚Äôre not, copying whatever they see on the internet like it‚Äôs their personality. You know the type those ‚Äúkhul mil‚Äù posers who act like they‚Äôre the coolest because they saw some TikTok edit or Instagram reel and think they‚Äôre experts. I HATE these people the most. They‚Äôll fake being into a popular series or movie just because it‚Äôs trending, but they‚Äôve only watched some half-baked TikTok explanation or a 15-second clip. No depth, no authenticity, just pure clout-chasing vibes. So, let me tell you about this one incident that had me HEATED. I was chilling at my mama‚Äôs ghar, and my 7th cousin or something (he‚Äôs like 3 years younger than me, so probably 18-ish) shows up for a visit or whatever. We‚Äôre just having a normal day, and I‚Äôm scrolling through Instagram reels. One of the reels pops up with a Breaking Bad scene, you know, the one where Jesse‚Äôs cooking meth with Badger, trying to mimic Walt‚Äôs technique. Iconic stuff. This cousin peeks over and goes, ‚ÄúYo, you watched Breaking Bad?‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúHell yeah, it‚Äôs a absolute peak.‚Äù He asks who my favorite character is, and I say Jesse Pinkman because, duh, he‚Äôs the GOATand all that stuff. Then he hits me with, ‚ÄúOh, my favorite‚Äôs Gus Fring.‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúAight, typical Breaking Bad fan pick, Gus is a badass.‚Äù But then he starts yapping about his ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù scenes, and something‚Äôs off. Like, he‚Äôs only describing the most TikTok-edited scenes the ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù moment, the big Gus explosion, you know, the ones that are ALL OVER social media. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs reciting a highlight reel from Instagram, not talking about the actual show. So, I‚Äôm getting sus. I decide to test this dude. I hit him with, ‚ÄúIf Gus is your favorite, what‚Äôs the actor‚Äôs real name?‚Äù He freezes. Like, full-on deer-in-headlights hesitation. After a beat, he mumbles, ‚ÄúUh, Giancarlo Esposito.‚Äù Okay, fair, he got that right, probably from seeing it in a TikTok caption. So I push further: ‚ÄúCool, what other movies or series has Giancarlo Esposito been in, besides Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul?‚Äù awkard silence. Dude‚Äôs got NOTHING. He‚Äôs just staring at me, brain buffering like a 2003 dial-up modem. So I call him out: ‚ÄúBro, be real. Have you actually watched Breaking Bad, or are you just explaining TikTok edits?‚Äù After a super awkward pause, he admits it. ‚ÄúOkay, fine, I didn‚Äôt watch it. I just saw some explanations and edits on TikTok.‚Äù BOOM. Exposed. This dude was straight-up faking it, trying to seem cool by pretending he‚Äôs a Breaking Bad stan when he‚Äôs just a wannabe hopping on the hype train. I‚Äôm so done with these types of people. They see something trending, latch onto it, and act like they‚Äôre part of the culture without putting in the work. Like, bro, just watch the show! It‚Äôs not that hard! Has anyone else dealt with these fake NPC wannabes? Drop your stories below because I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.",

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

To put it in perspective: My country Peru has a much larger territory 1,285,000 km¬≤, but its population is only 34 million.  My question for you is: In which regions of Nepal is the majority of the population concentrated? What is the distribution between mountainous areas and plains?",

So its simple man a big country in size doesn't mean big population because the more than half the country might only be freaking forest and stuff. And I think in Mongolia all the people live in like 1% of the land.|||Wait till you hear about Bangladesh|||Well Australia is 6 times bigger than Peru, yet has a smaller population than peru.|||India has 1.5 billion Bangladesh 170million. So Nepal population is low for the region but Almost 40%water in the ganges basin also comes from Nepal. This basin supports 600million people. Which is more than the population of south America.

History shows that the European contact vanished your almost 80% of the population due to the disease like Smallpox and measles and your population could not ever recover again unlike here in Nepal where we did not had any epidemic of such level which would wipe out almost 4/5th of the country's population. Our factor is liveable land if you see in N. America, the two countries Canada and USA are one of the biggest countries in the world, But USA has almost more than 10x population of Canada as most of the land is Canada is Tundra and life cannot flourish there.|||well maybe cuz people of Peru aren't spread out across the entire country??|||Favorable climate, fertile plains, and river systems enable multiple harvests a year.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are. Nepal's population comes from the region similar to them. I have no clue why peru has low population, maybe there isn't most habitable land. Like how russia is so massive but its population is low¬†|||If you know Peru, it's almost all mountainous terrain like a huge chunk of it is the Andes, and another chunk of it is the Amazon, with the rest being deserts where most people live.  Absolute extremes. The terrain absolutely messes things up.  Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ¬≤|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

From the news, it seems like your movement forced real accountability in just a couple of days, which is incredible.  I'm from Morocco, here we are dealing with very similar frustrations, endemic corruption, mismanagement, and policies that leave young people and everyday folks behind. We've already kicked off our own protests (youth-led ones demanding better health and education services, sparked by hospital crises in Agadir and spreading to cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangier), but we're hitting a wall with strong pushback from government forces: arrests, heavy police presence, and restrictions on gatherings.   We want to learn from your playbook to sustain momentum. Could you share some practical advice from your experience?   If you have personal stories, strategies, or even small tips from the front lines, we'd be grateful to hear them. What's one lesson from your protests that helped the most when things got intense?Thanks for your solidarity, stay strong, and here's hoping for better days on both sides.  World of GenZ",

Be ready for anykind of emergency situtaion, think who can be your leader if all leaders flee away or resign. And having a leader is always better. A protest without leader is just an uncontrollable crowd.|||What happened in Nepal was an unfortunate luck.¬†   First day protest was supposed to be peaceful protest against corruption of politicians, calling out Nepo kids and their luxury life.   Protesters entered the parliament(my theory is mimicking capital riot of USA thinking they won't be shot). 19 people died that day, including school kids.   This happened in such a sudden manner that entire country went to sleep trying to undertake what just happened.   Second day was the turning point as citizens raged and destroyed public property and lives were lost. A lot of inncoents.   We still are in uncertain phase and waiting for election.   One suggestion would be to protest peacefully and stay out of chaos.|||Set an agenda in advance, dont let the rioters damage juideciery, catch your leaders before they flee.|||Have a leader or two. And make sure you have a clear agenda. Very Very important.|||Set the agenda in Advance, write it in paper, If click make a symbolic photo of agenda paper handover, so that you can use that as an anchor to remind the interim government if they are slow or not doing their part. Share this picture everywhere so that this becomes a symbol.       Get back to building your society immediately if damage is too much.       Nepalese people saying corruption control is not happening are expecting interim government to round up politicians immediately without investigation, only to be released by next government after 6 month.   This is my expectation: I expected interim government to do is heavily target leader politicians of each party on corruption probe, KP OLI, Deuba, Prachanda. If they can jail them, atleast make it looks like they are almost nearing to arrest them, so that they become the news. We desperately need the news to travel remote areas for next election.|||well. in nepal, it is set that tho bad things are happening. Everyone has some kind of democratic consciousness. So, politicians cant really do massive arrest to dismiss the protest. This is enshrined to everyone of us. There are few radicals so, it is easier for everyone to get behind one agenda. So, young and olds will get behind it, though it was set to be GenZ revolution.   Also, it was very noble of nepalese army who had whole country in their palm, still didnt do any coup for power grab. This is very dangerous situation to be in. You dont wanna be in that situation.|||The purity of Nepalese protests is that they didn‚Äôt have a single leader or figure who could manipulate or guide them‚Äîbut that also became a boon. In Nepal, many groups with different political agendas infiltrated the movement. Youths are full of energy, often aggressive, so it becomes important to gather people in smaller groups, form a clear idea, and even assign group coordinators to channel the movement in a peaceful‚Äînot harmful way. These were our strengths and successes.  Now, let‚Äôs talk about the **failures, or our learning from aftermath of protest**:  1. **Lack of Political & Legal Awareness** Most youths had little knowledge of how law and politics work. A better approach would have been to involve seniors or mentors in discussions, and spread awareness through social media and educational circles. 2. **Losing the Narrative** Traditional media often framed the protests as violent, blaming youths for looting or burning when things went south. The counter-narrative should have emphasized that the government‚Äôs primary duty is protecting citizens‚Äô lives and property. Responsibility for escalation lies on both sides‚Äîbut more on the government. 3. **No Long-Term Structure or Sustainability** The protests lacked continuity beyond the streets. Once the immediate momentum died down, there was no organized follow-up in the form of civic groups, policy advocacy, or institutional lobbying. Without this, the energy of the movement dissolved quickly, leaving little long-term impact.  At the end of the day, what happens **after the protest** matters more than anything. Anarchists may tell you to ‚Äúkill the leaders,‚Äù but trust me no revolution built on that idea has ever succeeded. Real victory comes when you channel the movement into lasting change.  That means making a **clear list of demands (1, 2, 3, 4 ‚Ä¶)** and pushing to embed those changes inside the **constitution and legal framework**. Only then will the fight truly be won.  But in our case, even though we toppled the government, at the end of the day we lost more than we gained **the precious lives of 75 people, historic monuments, and even the trust of private sectors.**|||If you are expecting things to escalate:  Don't use hands to fight guns, at least use slingshots. Wear jackets, helmets. Take plenty of water and first aid kits with you.   Make sure your demands are properly stated, written and tegulated to public. Use proper means of communication on the ground and on air.|||Expect the Government to do anything even murder innocent people in numbers. Do not trust them. Keep protesting going. You people protesting in numbers is the biggest nightmare for any authoritarianism, eventually they will cave.|||I followed a bit of morocco's protest. What i think you guys are lacking is a leadership, clear goals. Also not strong moral narrative. In nepal, everyone was mad at the government and police for killing innocent children, (who were not looting of causing violence). They lost moral group. Police gave up next day. It was also very widespread too gov didn't have the capacity to handle it. Moroccan gov is more authoritarian too. Thus i think yall should expect more resistance. Yall didn't had the element of suprise or as strong moral backing or as clear goals or leadership like in nepal too.  Also idk how the protest is being organized but using discord for it is so great. Try and learn about what we did on discord also in hongkong|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Please have a designated leader. Things will go to shit otherwise.|||Set clear agenda and implement it immediately. Know the constitution.|||Find the right leader, otherwise the protest will be hijacked. Jail those politicians as soon as possible.|||Set agendas, set leadership, select the good retired bureaucrats and lawmakers and don't rush for meeting g without setting the fixed agendas.¬†|||Especially do anything you want but safely and don't destroy government properties.|||You guys need a project manager|||Don't destroy public properties|||If you guys have an internet shutdown, make sure everyone has this app that communicates via bluetooth. There are several, agree on one that everyone will use.|||The main agenda of protest was corruption control, I don‚Äôt see that happening in Nepal.|||1. Set clear adgendas.  2. Have gen-z leadership in place.  3. Don't let the infiltrators like udan urung hijack the revolution.  4. Don't damage the public property!|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||If you insist that protests need leaders, pick someone and then fully support and protect them. Governments may try to arrest leaders to weaken the movement, so organize to keep the protest going even if leaders are detained. Be prepared to keep up the pressure.   Also, change can demand great sacrifices, and many lives may be lost.|||Nepal protest only worked because 19 people including small kids were killed in one single day, caysing the whole Nepal to be in fury. People were red with anger and all that anger was expressed in 1 single day -- a day when there was no home minister to centrally command the police forces. I dont think this success is recreatable, even in Nepal.|||Before escalating the protest, make a proper plan of what is to be done after you win.|||DO NOT FALL FOR IT! What Nepal went through was a colour revolution strongly backed by the deep state. If we look at our current leaders, they are/were part of NGOs and INGOs funded by the CIA and the American government. Please don't romanticize what happened in Nepal.",

We worship daily, but divine care seems absent when it comes to national progress.  Temples often make headlines for thefts and misappropriation of funds, with some priests even selling sacred ornaments. If they truly fear God, why does this happen?  This is not limited to Hinduism; similar patterns exist across many religions.   It raises a question: is religion about faith, or has it become a tool to control and exploit the poor?  Interestingly, countries where many do not believe in God are often far more developed. Development is driven by people, not deities, yet the contrast is striking.

It is all scams. All man made religion and cult.  There are 33 Crore hindu gods.  Lots of Gods are forgotten already.   There is no possible way to count the number of forgotten gods because by their very nature, they have been lost to history.  However, we can explore the scale and reasons for this \"divine forgetting\" to understand just how vast that number must be. Think of it not as a number, but as an ocean compared to the few droplets of water that are the gods we still remember.  Here‚Äôs a breakdown of where these forgotten gods come from and why the number is essentially infinite:  1. Gods of Lost Cultures and Civilizations  For every major ancient civilization we know about (Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian), there were dozens, if not hundreds, of smaller cultures, tribes, and city-states that were absorbed, destroyed, or simply died out.  ¬∑ Example: The Canaanite pantheon is largely forgotten except for figures who appear in the Bible as villains or rivals. Where are the worshippers of Ba'al, Anat, or El today? Their stories are fragmentary. ¬∑ Scale: Across the Americas, Africa, Asia, and prehistoric Europe, countless tribes with their own unique spirits, creator gods, and deities vanished without a written record. Each tribe might have had a dozen or more significant divine figures. The collective number from this category alone is staggering.  2. Hyper-Local and Niche Deities  The ancient world was filled with gods who had very specific, limited portfolios.  ¬∑ Examples:   ¬∑ Roman Numina: These were minor spirits of specific places‚Äîthe god of a particular stream, a particular forest, a particular crossroads, or even the god of your household's front door (Cardea) or the pantry (Penates).   ¬∑ Greek River Gods: Every major river had its own god, like Achelous or Scamander. How many minor streams and springs had gods whose names were forever lost? ¬∑ Scale: If every village, spring, hill, and family had its own protective spirit or deity, the total number across the globe throughout history is unimaginably large.  3. Gods Who Evolved or Were Absorbed  As cultures merged, many gods were fused with others or simply fell out of favour.  ¬∑ Example: The Egyptian god Amun was merged with the sun god Ra to become Amun-Ra. What if Ra had been the one to be forgotten instead? Many lesser gods were likely absorbed in this way, their original identities lost. ¬∑ Example: The Roman god Sylvanus was an ancient god of the woods largely overshadowed by more popular gods like Diana or Mars. Countless others like him simply faded from popular worship.  4. Gods of Abandoned Religions  Entire religious systems have disappeared, taking their entire pantheons with them.  ¬∑ Examples:   ¬∑ The Hittite Empire had a pantheon of thousands of gods, most of whom are now only names on clay tablets, understood by a handful of scholars.   ¬∑ The Manichaean religion, once a major world faith, is now extinct, and its complex cosmology of gods and divine beings is largely forgotten.   ¬∑ Pre-Christian Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic paganism are reconstructed from fragments and folklore. We know the names of a few major gods like Perun or Cernunnos, but the vast majority of their divine beings are unknown to us.  A Philosophical and Literary Perspective  The concept of forgotten gods is a powerful theme in modern fantasy and horror (most famously in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and Neil Gaiman's American Gods). These stories suggest that gods are sustained by belief, and when belief dies, the gods fade into a shadowy, powerless existence, waiting in the void. From this perspective, the \"forgotten gods\" are a near-infinite multitude, a silent chorus of the divine that humanity has left behind.  Conclusion  So, to answer \"how many?\":  ¬∑ Historically: The number is countless and uncountable. It includes all the household spirits, local river gods, and tribal deities from cultures that left no written record. ¬∑ Metaphorically: The number is infinite, limited only by the number of places, concepts, and fears that humans have ever tried to personify and worship, only to eventually move on.  The forgotten gods outnumber the remembered ones not by dozens or hundreds but by orders of magnitude that we can never truly comprehend. They are the dark matter of the divine cosmos‚Äîthe overwhelming majority of what was once there, now invisible and unknown.|||If you've watched the movie PK then it sums up religion very well. There's 2 types of gods, the one that made us and the one that we made. The first one we don't even know if exists or not whereas the second one is people created for their own goals|||Some  believe in god only when they come between a paranormal entity.|||God is a lie.¬†   And Krishna said, if a lie does good to someone, that is not a lie.   Camus said there are three options for life.   Either kill yourself because there is no meaning.   Or submit to a higher power and live under that.   Third option is to live the life even if it doesn't have meaning. You got the life, so might as well enjoy it while living. Taste the chicken. Listen to a song. Look around. One day you will die anyway.|||\"If there is a god, atheism must seem less as an insult to him than religion\" - Edmond  de Goncourt|||Of course it is, religion was made up by ancient people to control other people.|||Yes it is|||This kind of thought can only arrive when you reach some level of consciousness.

It is only a belief system; people have to cope with the different facets of reality. At least, that's how I take religion and many other systems of thinking. It's neither a tool to control nor a tool to exploit the poor. But it has gotten that way now, though. When people are overly reliant on religions, that's when they get exploited. We need to understand that religion itself isn't a bad thing, but having a blind trust in it is wrong. It is bad for you, your family, your society, your nation and for the whole world.|||‡§Ü‡§´‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§ó‡§æ‡§â, ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú, ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§¨‡•à ‡§ú‡§ó‡§æ‡§â‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡•á‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•ã¬†  STAY AWAKE ->> ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§∏‡§¨‡•à ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§®‡§§‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï ‡§≠‡§è‡§∞ ‡§ß‡•á‡§∞‡•à ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•Å ‡§õ¬†  ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¨‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§§‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡•å‡§Ç ‚úä|||Yes; i go to a religious place, and people perform some religious practices which they are doing since they were kids; did they ever ask themselves why?

Buddhism ma god concept nai chaina|||The reason we have such temples, architecture, culture and religious devotion particularly in Kathmandu valley - newa culture, tradition and religion, was that at some point of time, they were a very stratified community i.e. resource rich, abundance of resource and time, and also isolated from much of external territorial clashes. Thus people were able to explore culture, develop tradition and dedicate time and resources to the religious pursuit.   Religion and culture is a way to explore divinity,  philosophy, metaphysics, life, death and beyond. It has its beauty, strengths and flaws like every human philosophical exploration.  But to answer the question of Development, infrastructure being built, particularly Western countries and many other countries while contrasting Asian countries is a complex historical and economic topic. You need to look at how modern development and infrastructure came to be. Why development occurred in some fields faster than others. And Why have our countries lagged behind in the past 300 years. And also the population boom and industrial revolution of the 19th and 20th century.   They've been constantly at war , so they had to take initiatives to outgrow and outperform their rivals leading to rapid research and development.   It's a big topic to cover.   And your misconception of Western countries and developed countries not being religious is not true.  Look at the big churches they've built, their art development alongside their religion eg- Davincis last resort.    You can see they have created a strong religious identity and are trying their best at spreading it wherever they go.  Whole Villages here in Nepal have converted to Christianity religion. And then there's factions of Muslims trying to do the same in other countries. ( Not in Nepal atm.)  They have contested their religion against others, they have seminars for religious conversions, research to pit their religious views against other religions, and actually are investing huge into conversions towards their religion. This can't be denied.  You look at china and Japan today, investing tons into their history and identity. Just a few decades ago, china was hugely behind in development and infrastructure. They've played their cards well in recent times.  You must understand today, the notions of absolute opposition to religion stems from leftist, communist and socialist narratives. Bending facts with fiction to push their ideology one way or another, all for pursuit of power. Eg- how maoist in Nepal manipulated facts and ficticious ideas to captivate the populus.   But, There have always been ways in our culture to be agnostic and still be a part of society.   Well, tldr, West is very religious, but they outpaced most due to rapid industrialization, marketisation, their investment into RnD and human resource.  India was under opressive British rule. Us in Nepal, fell behind when we failed to initiate our industrial revolution and we went to isolation during the industrial revolution. (Rana regime)  But, with positive steps, we are catching up.|||it's necessay to run and regulate for better of humanity! not everyone like books nerds!|||No, god is great. Religion is also great.

            "body": "Hey r/Nepal, I'm a Grade 12 student dealing with a family crisis and I need urgent advice. My grandpa has severe CKD and an infection.   The government hospital in our district (Rajbiraj) is supposed to provide free dialysis for poor citizens, but they are refusing him due to the infection, and they're also sitting on unused dialysis machines claiming \"no installation space.\"  Because of this, my dad has to take my grandpa on a long, single-session trip to Dharan every week.  My dad is a security guard with a strict 12-hour shift, 7 days a week, because there are only two guards at the bank. He is exhausted, sick, and running himself into the ground.  I feel helpless watching him struggle against the company's rules and the hospital's cruelty. I have two urgent questions:  1. Work Shift: Is the 12-Hour Shift Legal? Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this  Idk if 12 hour shift he is doing is considered stander or overtime. But I know before the few years it was 3 guard in bank with 8 hour of shift. 2 in day and 1 in night.  Is it legal to make him work for 12 hour.    Can he legally request a reduced shift or a third guard, citing a critical family health emergency that's affecting his ability to work safely?  2. Hospital Denial:  What are our Rights?   The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?  How can we use public pressure (like local media) to shame the hospital into installing the unused dialysis machines they are hoarding due to an absurd \"no space\" excuse?  Please, any practical advice or contact info for legal/social workers in Nepal would be a lifeline right now. Thank you   I have uses ai for better articulation",

Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this**  No, it is not legal. Look at [the labor act](https://antislaverylaw.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Labour-Act-2017.pdf). Go to page 18. It says:  >**Working hours:** (1) No employer shall employ labours to work more than eight hours a day and forty-eight hours a week. (2) The labours shall be provided with half an hour rest after five hours of continuous work. (3) In the cases of work which is not to be stopped and is to be carried out continuously, labours shall be provided with such a rest time turn by turn.  >**Not to compel to work overtime:** (1) No employer shall compel a labour to work more than the hours set forth in sub-section (1) of Section 28.  >**Additional remuneration to be paid:** (1) While employing any labour to work overtime pursuant to Section 30, the employer shall pay to the labour remuneration at a rate of 1.5 times of the basic remuneration receivable during regular hours of work.  In simple words, your father should only be made to work 8 hours a day, 48 hours a week. He can't be forced to work more than that. Even in those 8 hours a day shift, he should be given 30 hours a rest after every 5 hours of continuous work. And overtime is completely voluntary. That overtime should be paid at 1.5 times the normal rate.  **2. Hospital Denial: What are our Rights?**  **The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?**  Hami Nepal might be able to help you. I have seen them protest against BPKIHS and Bir Hopsital for similar issues.

But for moat cases, hospital have seperate dialysis machine for such patient.   The risk is two fold, if your grandpa have this disease and he is put on this normal dialysis machine , then the disease will spread to other CKD patient who comes after your grandpa. If your grandpa is normal and the machine is reserved for infected patient, then your grandpa can catch the infection.|||Sorry about your situation. Your question sounds like a race against time. It may be illegal to have him work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week but are you going to get relief in time?   The hospital after pressure may add the new dialysis machine after pressure but are they going to do it in time?   I think your dad should consider changing a job - I know it is easier said than done. Maybe explore NGOs that may be able to help, if not in money, maybe they can help put some pressure on the hospital.   The job situation is a bit tricky - generally if a job is not working for people they should change it. I know this one is a hard one though given location and job type.

            "body": "30-40 barsa pachi pani hamiley yei news Sunna parney. \"Yo pali dashain ma 20 lakh- 30 lakh Jana le Kathmandu valley chodyo bhanera\"? Ani Mugling ma jaam? Landslide ani Bus trishuli ma khasyo? Decentralization of Nepal from Kathmandu is extremely needed and planned city outside of Kathamandu is must. Every year floods fill up houses in Kathmandu. Also it is earthquake prone zone plus pollution reaches record index topping the world chart.  But when ever politicians make any plans mono -rail, high performance sports centre, IT hub, Stadiums, etc. they all plan to build it inside Kathmandu. Why? There is no Nepal outside Kathmandu? We should think of decentralizing Kathamandu soon. For reference: in India Delhi is capital city but Banglore, Pune is IT city, Mumbai is film city, and India is building Sports city in Ahmedabad to bid for Olympics. But in Nepal everything happens in one city and that is Kathmandu.   We need atleast one planned city in Middle of east Nepal (near fast track end and BP Sindhuli highway terai end) and one in middle of West Nepal (Dang valley) as form of IT hub or Sports city, etc. at least for now.  1. We don't win a single Olympics medal. But building Sports city with sports arenas, stadiums of all sports, high performance training centre, trauma centre for minor and major injuries recovery of players, etc. so about thousand, lakhs of players, coaches, etc. will be in that city reducing dependency on Kathmandu and decreasing population of Kathmandu. We can bid for SAARC games and Asian Games if we have infrasture.   2. We could move ahead to build metro station for connecting major cities like Biratnagar- Itahari, Dharan-Birtamode in east. Chitwan-Hetauda-Birgunj in mid Nepal, Butwal-Bhairawa-Dang as for Lumbini Tourism enhancement, on site Dhangadi-Attariya, etc.  3. We can choose Dang valley as potential IT city like silicon valley or Banglore. We could build metro connection (Ghorahi-Tulsipur) there and make in PPP partnership with the buildings and government buildings with Nepali western architecture enhancing beauty. We can ask National Innovation centre of Mahabir Pun, Yatri motorcycles and IT companies and others to move there and do research and innovations for things needed to Nepal and be IT hub like Banglore and Silicon valley. Hiking route to pyuthan and trekking route to Dhorpatan could be developed for weekends plan.   4. Major cities should be reconstructed and all DPR should be canceled and major roads, highways should made with (wider footpath-cycle lane-Trees -4/6 lanes in middle and same on both sides). So that terai cities like Biratnagar, Birtamode, Itahari, Janakpur, Birgung, Nepalgunj, Butwal, Dhangadi, etc. with excessive heat in summer would be liveable as trees shade would fall upon footpaths and cycle lane and buses and motorcycle while travelling. And terai cities to hill stations and mountains route should be developed for travel and holidays/weekends.  5. All universities infrastructure outside Kathmandu should be upgraded and maintained and also major building should be in Nepali design as most foreign universities are like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, etc with proper infrasture development to attract students study there.  6. Additionally not related to decentralization but minimum monthly salary for 8 hours duty should be determined by dividing jobs in caterogies like other countries non-skilled, Semi skilled, skilled and fully skilled. Most industries make enginners work 12 hours and don't pay even minimum of labors salary of 8 hours and even Saturday is not given holiday in many industries. Also in hospitals is same case for nurses and other professionals as well. Also player should be paid minimum salary and law should be passed.   Addressing these things will help population to be divided among Nepal and reduce necessity to live in Kathmandu. Kathmandu is already historic city and we don't need flyovers, monorail, etc. and ruin it's beauty. Please add if you have more ideas in the given needs and mail to necessary authorities like kulman ghising, mahabir pun, etc. if you have mail I'd or number.",

As citizens, we are not asking for luxuries  only the basics: proper roads, quality education, justice, industries, sports infrastructure, transparency in taxation, and genuine support for agriculture. If nations like the USA, Ireland, Canada, Japan, and China could transform within decades, Nepal can too  but only if we focus on unity, discipline, and vision.  1. Agriculture and Export Driven Economy   Instead of importing almost everything, we should prioritize exports. Nepals fertile land can support large scale organic farming and high value crops. Marijuana and hemp, legalized strictly for export, could become billion dollar industries. Like Canada and Ireland, agricultural cooperatives should be modernized with technology, irrigation, and subsidies to farmers.   2. Tourism and Cultural Heritage   Tourism should be developed as one of our strongest economic backbones. Kathmandu Valley must be preserved as a world class cultural heritage hub, like Kyoto in Japan.  Mountain and adventure tourism should be expanded with world class trekking routes, cable cars, and eco tourism villages. Each district should showcase unique cultural, historical, or natural heritage to attract domestic and international tourists.   3. Industrial and Technological Hubs  Every district should host at least four to five industries based on local resources.  Cities like Chitwan, Hetauda, Birgunj, Biratnagar, and Nepalgunj should be major industrial corridors, like Shenzhen in China or Detroit in the USA. IT hubs must be developed to stop brain drain, inspired by Irelands Tech Island model. Encourage startups, innovation centers, and digital infrastructure.   4. Sports and National Identity  Establish national sports training grounds in every province. Focus on Olympic level facilities for football, cricket, martial arts, and athletics.  Take inspiration from China and Japan, who invested in sports to uplift national pride. Sports can create jobs, unity, and international recognition.  5. Infrastructure and Connectivity   All districts must be connected within four to five hours of travel with highways, regional airports, and modern public transport. Introduce metro or rapid rail linking Kathmandu Valley to nearby cities. Smart transportation like Japans Shinkansen or Canadas efficient highways should be our model.   6. Governance and Accountability  Strict rules and regulations for politicians ‚Äî no one above the law.  Police and media must be independent, like in developed democracies. Civil service and government jobs should be limited to ten years, not lifetime tenure, so fresh talent always enters the system. Adopt transparency systems like Canada and the USA where every rupee of tax is accounted for.   7. Education and Innovation   Free quality education up to secondary level, with strong focus on STEM, arts, and culture. Universities should link directly with industries, like in the USA and Japan, to create job ready graduates.  Encourage vocational training and research so youth can become innovators, not just job seekers abroad  8. Country First System  Above all, every policy, project, and law must prioritize Nepals prosperity.  National interest must come before political parties or individual gains.  If Japan and China could rise from devastation, if Ireland could transform from poverty into Europes tech hub, if the USA and Canada can sustain growth with diversity Nepal too can build a proud future.|||This is needed very much for the development of nepal.|||Yes and the goal should be does a KTM person want to move to that city or not.¬†   Start with establishing education institute to lure students and setup business around to stick them there.

Bro I want pleasure not responsibility.|||The concept of decentralized governance through federal provinces in Nepal, often referred to as \"federalism\" or \"pradesh\" (province) system, has roots in demands for regional autonomy and evolved over decades amid political movements, ethnic advocacy, and constitutional reforms.  This evolution reflects a shift from centralized monarchy to decentralized federalism, driven by ethnic inclusion and regional equity, though rooted in ancient feudal practices adapted to modern demands.  The necessity of decentralized governance through federal provinces in Nepal stems from the country's diverse geography, ethnicity, and historical centralization, which created disparities and marginalization.   Below is a concise explanation of why federalism was deemed essential, based on key factors:  Addressing Ethnic and Cultural Diversity: Nepal has over 125 ethnic groups and 123 languages.   Centralized governance historically marginalized groups like Madhesis, Janajatis, and Dalits, favoring Kathmandu-centric elites. Federalism allows provinces to preserve linguistic, cultural, and ethnic identities through local governance, reducing discrimination and fostering inclusion.\r Reducing Regional Disparities: Nepal‚Äôs diverse terrain (Himalayas, hills, Tarai) led to uneven development, with remote areas neglected. Federal provinces enable localized decision-making, allowing regions to prioritize their economic and infrastructural needs, such as agriculture in Tarai or tourism in mountainous areas.  \r Political Representation and Autonomy: Centralized rule concentrated power in Kathmandu, alienating regions like the Tarai and far-west. Federalism devolves power to provinces, granting them legislative and administrative authority to address local issues, enhancing political participation and accountability.  \r Mitigating Conflict and Unrest: The Maoist insurgency (1996‚Äì2006) and Madhesi movements (2007‚Äì2008) highlighted demands for regional autonomy. Federalism was a response to these conflicts, aiming to prevent further unrest by ensuring equitable representation and resource distribution.  \r Strengthening Democracy: By decentralizing power, federalism promotes grassroots democracy, allowing local governments to address community-specific needs. This counters the autocratic tendencies of past monarchical and centralized systems, fostering cooperative governance across federal, provincial, and local levels.  \r Economic Efficiency and Development: Provinces can tailor policies to their economic strengths (e.g., hydropower in hilly provinces, agriculture in Tarai), optimizing resource use. Decentralized governance reduces bureaucratic delays from Kathmandu, enabling faster implementation of development projects.\r \r Despite its necessity, challenges like resource allocation, inter-provincial disputes, and incomplete devolution persist, requiring ongoing refinement to ensure effective governance. Federalism remains critical to balancing Nepal‚Äôs diverse needs with national unity.",

It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government-- in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom.

Dubei group ko extremist ko rise hudei cha.  But these are the kind of things I used to see in Indian news but lately I have been seeing it in Nepali news as well. So yesterday I was in Birgunj and I witnessed something that made me kinda angry as well as sad. I had seen it in videos too but iguess seeing it live just pisses you off more.  So what happened was yesterday, this huge group of guys carrying those ‚ÄúJay Shree Ram‚Äù flags were having this really huge rally in Birgunj. You could easily see majority of them were Indians. In the rally there were tons of bikes but most of them had number plates of India. They had this jeep where lots of guys were hanging and chanting Jay Shree Ram, huge speakers blasting music. And the guys on the bike were not wearing helmets or anything, instead they were over confident, driving recklessly. Some of them were even carrying swords, yes literal swords.  And there was police presence but only couple of them. And yeah it was too irritating. Especially the fact that half of them were Indians, they were in Indian vehicles, out here in Nepal doing unnecessary stunt bazi. It just pissed me off. They were disturbing traffic as well but no way anyone could say anything because you can literally see they are those rowdy ones. They too are goons of some group so arguing with them meant getting into a fight with them. Even though there were cops I hardly believe situation would‚Äôve gotten calm sooner. Anyways yeah, seeing so many Indian Bihari people out there with their Bihari number plate here in Nepal disturbing peace just pissed me off.  **Also isn‚Äôt there some law or anything barring Indian vehicles to participate in this kind of activities in Nepal?**¬†Because more than half of the vehicles there were Indian. Isn‚Äôt this them disturbing peace of another nation? I mean I am not aware about the law so asking. They were in another country, in their own country‚Äôs bikes, no helmets or anything, reckless driving, disturbing peace, sometimes even getting into riots. How is this not illegal?  And that makes me think,¬†**is this something they‚Äôre (gov) deliberately letting happen?**¬†I mean, obviously cops can‚Äôt just make arrests themselves, they need orders from higher-ups. So are the higher-ups letting this pass due to some political reason? Or are they too under the control of Indian influence or what? Because like I said, these were literally citizens of another country disturbing the peace of our country. Yes, there were Nepali people in the rally too, tons of Nepali vehicles as well, but there were equal numbers of Indian vehicles. Gunda haru liera aako thiey India dekhi nei.  So just wanted to share this here as well. These kind of things have been going on since quite some time recently. Just few months back here in Birgunj there was this huge fight between Muslim group and Hindu group. Now idk who was the culprit here or anything but I do know that Indian group infiltration is one of the most likely reason.  Edit: So I am sharing the experience I had yesterday, the things I witnessed and some of the talks I had with people here combined. To all those saying why this and not why that, like I said, I just shared what I witnessed yesterday.",

They simply can't sustain themselves against the cyber operations of the established parties.  Let me share an incident with you all.

Oli, Deuba, and Prachanda all have massive cyber armies and huge amounts of money to distribute, often hidden away in the homes of various party workers (*karyakarta*).

The police-inmate conflict is not as escalated as other countries where criminal groups are more \"institutionalized\" (USA, India, ...) The jails are, therefore, not as tense and unsafe. Combined with the general attitude towards foreigners (especially white ones) and the culture of regarding them as \"guests\", I would assume that a white American would have a pretty easy time in Nepali jails.|||If local Nepalis find the living condition bad then it's probably 100x bad for you.

I would hope things have improved since then,  ut doubt it. I was working on Nepal and one of my employees was arrested. I went to visit him in the Patan jail. The ‚Äújail‚Äù was one large very dark room with about 30 people locked up in it. There was a trough running down the middle of the floor that inmates used for pee and poop. Food was the bare minimum - rice and a very watery potato dhal. No beds, and the only garments or bedding used by prisoners were whatever was brought by family members who had to bribe the jailers to pass it on. Again this was a long time ago so take it with a grain of salt and hope conditions are better. I would assume that if an inmate had the funds they could secure nicer accommodations.|||From my experience of visiting Nepali prisons for research purposes, there are a few factors that determine how bad it is, each location is different in terms of the facilities and practices. Overall I would say the living conditions are pretty bad in most prisons, places are cramped, so not a lot of personal space, hygiene and access to healthcare is an issue. However, There are also some good prisons with facilities like gym, some providing mental health support, vocational training and so on. So it really depends on which prison but there really isn‚Äôt any imminent threat to life or gang violence or anything extreme. From what I saw, everybody does their own thing and it‚Äôs pretty chill, there are ‚Äúleaders‚Äù like a class captains who pretty much run the place and communicate with the police officers. I also met some foreigners although they were not white or American. Ofcourse they were treated really well like any other place in Nepal, the only complaint they had was about the justice system and how fucked up it is in Nepal and how many innocent people are in jail.|||It‚Äôs pretty chill they‚Äôll let you out once in a while when there‚Äôs like a protest or smth or like a flood and expect you to report yourself so they can put you back.

Actually you don't even need to ask this question, every human has a purpose: to keep living on‚Äîeither survive with eternal lifespan or reproduction. Aba purpose tw thaha bhae halyo, what should you do? Live in the best way your current self can understand and afford. See you got the purpose(to live) and for being more specific you also got a goal(make the best out of the your life).  It sounds like we are back to starting point as you're kind of asking how to live. You don't need to know more either, people are just bored so they just keep adding complexities to pass their time. Purpose of human life is simple, just live.  Arko bhayo job ko kura. For getting a job you need: skills to do the job, way to let people know that you have these skills and they can trust you with that job, and reason for them to choose you over others(it could be your skills, your popularity, your relationship with them, etc).  But what if my efforts of learning all these skills are wasted? If you're really skilled, any outdated tech skills will still get you job in right places. That aside, if you're not really passionate about something beforehand, then sikney bhanera kasari choose garney? Let's understand this with holi tshirt and casual tshirt analogy. You cannot start producing holi tshirt off-season 'cause you saw good sales of holi tshirt in holi season. But if you know there will be demand of holi tshirt, then it might be good idea to start producing holi tshirt before holi season. Also, if you can know there is a demand of holi tshirt during holi season, you should only print them if you can produce and make them reach customer on time. Otherwise, it's better to focus on casual tshirt production.  Aru tw problem timi lai chear nai xa, and you also know what to do about them.

It's just logic.  We can enjoy and celebrate our cultural practices, examine them, and update them.    Our ancestors not only created new traditions but also stopped the ones they didn't like.

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity. It's better that Chettri shouldn't be inferring in Gurung's culture and lifestyle. SImilarl, Limbu shouldn't be talking and critiquing Bahuns way of doing things.

Reform must come from us  You said it yourself. It is not perfect and they might need reform.  >orchestrated online campaigns that want us to be ashamed of who we are  I have seen various posts claiming the same thing. What is the basis for that? Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea. I haven't seen it being criticized or ridiculed by anyone else from international communities.  >We are debating in Western language, wearing Western dress, using Western devices, and posting on Western platforms. Naturally these spaces are full of hate against Nepali culture, because the ecosystem itself is designed to amplify Western values while mocking our own.  How ironic! You could have at least posted this in Nepali then. I don't think most people's goal is to mock our culture, it's more of constructive criticism, at least, from my point of view. Well I do have criticism about lots of aspects of many western cultures as well. But if I make a post or comment pertaining to that then lots of people like you would probably just accuse me of emphasizing western culture too much. I criticize Nepali culture and tradition because I grew up on them and I know them well and it's part of my lifestyle as well.

Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn‚Äôt right, but those conditions don‚Äôt exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life.

Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists.

The facts, based on local Nepali voices and government policies, paint a very different, much more nuanced picture that overwhelmingly supports the continuation of this vital cultural practice, proving it is not exploitative in nature.    The Reality of the Living Goddess: A Cultural Privilege üá≥üáµ  Not Isolated, But Tutored and Connected: The claim of \"isolation from family\" is a common critique. In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it‚Äôs either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

That doesn‚Äôt make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn‚Äôt mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||This was much needed!

Follow the pattern‚Ä¶ the outfits, the wedding decorations, jewellery, she made it come to reality. She followed it diligently - color, design, looks, everything. Likewise, will be her uncountable homes and more plethora of jewellery. You are making people aware what she was upto on the days of the protests and the tragedy of losing innocent lives. Some people will always defend her no matter what as most of them are paid PR people.   Her homes which she shared with the husband are perhaps and most probably their upcoming homes and redecorations which she has said she is renovating three of her houses. The Sirohiya house that was burnt down was surprisingly not lavish at all despite the corruption scale. They are of course building a new house, what else would you do with all that black money. She wants to get into politics and the scale of the house will be similar. She does everything for the clout and to portray this picture perfect curated lifestyle.  Whenever someone wants to warn people, they are always ridiculed. There were people who exposed her long time back but they were also met with unfair repercussions. People are speaking up now because her hypocrisy has been on the forefront.  You did your job, let the people do whatever they want with the info. When the time comes, they will think back and say yes there were signs but‚Ä¶.This is exactly how the corruption went overboard cause few people called out things but they were never taken seriously, this continued for decades giving the corrupt people the benefit of the doubt and even after they have been exposed now, they still have the audacity to say that they have been nothing but victims. All happened because no one listened, no one cared, no one acknowledged and there was no accountability until it was too late.  Srinkhala, her parents, her in laws and her husband are frauds and parasites. Everyone knows that but still some people don‚Äôt want to accept it and live in denial. Her brother was supposed to get married the week or following after the protests. It‚Äôs a fact! She did not disclose this, the media did. She pinned the jewelry ideas around the same time and if people still defend her then just leave it at that. If the protests did not happen, we would have seen her never ending posts about the wedding, what she wore, what she is working on as ‚Äúan architect‚Äù. Her home- her dream project will be a lavish one because it has to match her ambition and ego. She makes everything about herself, you think she won‚Äôt make her dream project about herself? Then she will come out and say it was all her vision, she got inspired by this sustainability and how her husband guided her into making better decisions like her wedding speech.  If she was really talented, her Gaatha and skincare line would not have been what it is today. Whatever little publicity those are getting are because she has been endorsing both. Nepal ma alikati kei ramro bhayo ki successful bhaihalcha. Yo ta jhan afailay endorse gareko brainchild ho re in her own words. If it is not making any rounds and not doing well then there is clearly no talent with the amount of money, position, connections, power and influence that she has especially after getting married.  So thank you for sharing what you saw to make us aware. You can‚Äôt do anything with people who want to turn a blind eye and stay oblivious/ ignorant. Bujhnay le bujhihalchan.

You can always decide whether to share or not. For now, I think saving and sharing those would have exposed her more for people who are gullible and want to remain ignorant.

Backtracked on BPKIHS reform promises ‚Äì Before becoming mayor, he was vocal about issues at BPKIHS, but once in office, he sidelined the movement and discredited people‚Äôs genuine protests.

Failure in waste management ‚Äì Garbage collection and waste disposal in Dharan are in disarray, with no systematic or sustainable solution.  Water supply problem remains unresolved ‚Äì Despite his earlier activism around drinking water, Dharan still struggles with scarcity and mismanagement of water resources .Due to his arragonce and fight against previous governments.   No vision for employment generation ‚Äì Youth migration continues, as no new industries or opportunities have been created to retain talent within Dharan.  Neglected the health sector at the local level ‚Äì While vocal about BPKIHS, he has done little to improve basic healthcare facilities for ordinary citizens.  Poor coordination with provincial and federal governments ‚Äì Instead of collaborating for development, he often takes a confrontational stance that delays or cancels much-needed projects.

Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Gang fight leading to some serious consequence. They'll be spending crazy amount of parent money on cafes and dates and shit. Girls also be flocking towards the jhyaple bad boy type. Both sides will have attachment-less fun for some months and proceed to the next like no big deal.  My own classmates used to change bf like changing clothes. One was stupid enough to send her bf n-des and the whole school got hold of it, just imagine the trauma it will give her in future. Everyone doing whatever the fk it is in the same of true love which changes every few month.      Being a serious guy with some goals in mind used to be the black sheep, still is in colleges. I used to get kinda bullied and the odd one just cuz I didn't have a chick and I didn't goto the cafes and inhale some expensive flavoured shit lmao. (not the reason im attacking this topic tho).

            "body": "I need to vent about those cringe NPC-type people who just wannabe something they‚Äôre not, copying whatever they see on the internet like it‚Äôs their personality. You know the type those ‚Äúkhul mil‚Äù posers who act like they‚Äôre the coolest because they saw some TikTok edit or Instagram reel and think they‚Äôre experts. I HATE these people the most. They‚Äôll fake being into a popular series or movie just because it‚Äôs trending, but they‚Äôve only watched some half-baked TikTok explanation or a 15-second clip. No depth, no authenticity, just pure clout-chasing vibes. So, let me tell you about this one incident that had me HEATED. I was chilling at my mama‚Äôs ghar, and my 7th cousin or something (he‚Äôs like 3 years younger than me, so probably 18-ish) shows up for a visit or whatever. We‚Äôre just having a normal day, and I‚Äôm scrolling through Instagram reels. One of the reels pops up with a Breaking Bad scene, you know, the one where Jesse‚Äôs cooking meth with Badger, trying to mimic Walt‚Äôs technique. Iconic stuff. This cousin peeks over and goes, ‚ÄúYo, you watched Breaking Bad?‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúHell yeah, it‚Äôs a absolute peak.‚Äù He asks who my favorite character is, and I say Jesse Pinkman because, duh, he‚Äôs the GOATand all that stuff. Then he hits me with, ‚ÄúOh, my favorite‚Äôs Gus Fring.‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúAight, typical Breaking Bad fan pick, Gus is a badass.‚Äù But then he starts yapping about his ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù scenes, and something‚Äôs off. Like, he‚Äôs only describing the most TikTok-edited scenes the ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù moment, the big Gus explosion, you know, the ones that are ALL OVER social media. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs reciting a highlight reel from Instagram, not talking about the actual show. So, I‚Äôm getting sus. I decide to test this dude. I hit him with, ‚ÄúIf Gus is your favorite, what‚Äôs the actor‚Äôs real name?‚Äù He freezes. Like, full-on deer-in-headlights hesitation. After a beat, he mumbles, ‚ÄúUh, Giancarlo Esposito.‚Äù Okay, fair, he got that right, probably from seeing it in a TikTok caption. So I push further: ‚ÄúCool, what other movies or series has Giancarlo Esposito been in, besides Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul?‚Äù awkard silence. Dude‚Äôs got NOTHING. He‚Äôs just staring at me, brain buffering like a 2003 dial-up modem. So I call him out: ‚ÄúBro, be real. Have you actually watched Breaking Bad, or are you just explaining TikTok edits?‚Äù After a super awkward pause, he admits it. ‚ÄúOkay, fine, I didn‚Äôt watch it. I just saw some explanations and edits on TikTok.‚Äù BOOM. Exposed. This dude was straight-up faking it, trying to seem cool by pretending he‚Äôs a Breaking Bad stan when he‚Äôs just a wannabe hopping on the hype train. I‚Äôm so done with these types of people. They see something trending, latch onto it, and act like they‚Äôre part of the culture without putting in the work. Like, bro, just watch the show! It‚Äôs not that hard! Has anyone else dealt with these fake NPC wannabes? Drop your stories below because I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.",

But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.   Anyways, I am open for a discussion and may be able to pose any questions to the people in the inner circle. I don‚Äôt know much myself but do have the connections if we want the facts so we can all stop conspiring.  Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime. Like I have never seen such a sad expression ever probably cause she cant smile or cry.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

You‚Äôve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families. Where do you think that is abusive? You are living in a bubble. It is a different culture and a tradition it doesnt mean that it is abusive. Kumaris have had a long history, have you ever heard one of them come out and say that it was traumatic? Stop your virtue signaling.|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

How many injustices do females have to suffer in the name of culture, tradition and religion- it never crosses anybody's mind.|||Ask ex-Kumaris if it felt or was cruel. Others life always looks cruel and difficult from outside point of view. If their parents don‚Äôt object the tradition, who are you as an outsider to object it? Are you saying you love someone else‚Äôs kid than their own parents?|||Do the parents not have any say in this?|||This is sick|||I feel like more people should be aware (not trying to disrespect the culture)|||OP, you‚Äôve raised a really important point. To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2.¬†PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must¬†**immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3.¬†ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must¬†**publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel**¬†for \"preserving democracy\" and¬†**offer ceremonial role**¬†in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4.¬†EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives**¬†in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline**¬†to new elections  # 5.¬†INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must¬†**immediately recognize**¬†any civilian arrangement.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

Balen wasn't there when the movement needed him the most.|||Balen is narendra modi of nepal|||Ok, I don‚Äôt follow Balens politics a lot but if he had said he wants to be interim PM, would you have not criticized he was being opportunist?  Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say ‚ÄúThis person is bad/clueless , country isn‚Äôt safe with them‚Äù. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don‚Äôt need ¬†more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don‚Äôt forget to question often.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

If Balen had come out saying he‚Äôs ready to lead, a lot of people would‚Äôve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit.

I‚Äôm all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it.

It runs on power. Until you understand this, you‚Äôll not understand the situation. And those who understand this controls the narrative. Our country is so at the bottom of the barrel, we don‚Äôt need much of foreign resources to be infiltrated, mind-bended. Sudan stance, I don‚Äôt know his clear motives of against or with the country. But I‚Äôm sure even he does not know he‚Äôs a small puppet planted/invested long ago. Usually foreign powers will not directly direct its agenda, especially for the country at the bottom of the barrel they do not have the time to do so. You just give them small aid, support for us, for them simple investment, which they just got good return this time, especially now east is rising its economy. You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do. Think about it, nobody was going forward with stance like him to take on some kind of leader role, because we do not have that power (support) and as human we fear unknown.  You might think I‚Äôm thinking too much of this. Well, I can‚Äôt argue you, because I do not know for sure, but this is my stance and most probable thing I saw.",

The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

Considering we're in a democratic system with democratic framework, I suggest Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Nepal should be given the interim power because Legislature-Executive-Judiciary are the head of country, since President is said to be planning to resign and PM has resigned best would be to get Judicial head. You might say he's corrupt but hear me out, his only job should be to conduct fair elections and fulfill the demands of us(youth) as he's the only guy who knows about constitution more than any of us.

There have been big changes since 2047, up to 2062-2063.  Public property and individuals were not targeted.

I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him. It wasn't because of his popularity, but because of that frustration.Look at his recent activity, he cannot coordinate with the 20 members and bring the budget in on time   And so called the Sharaman, it's the illusion, of the corruption|||Not being a racist, but most people who are blindly supporting him are from Mongolian ethnicity ( mostly Rai and Kirati) .|||Even Kulman is a corrupt person.

The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We‚Äôre falling into the same trap again.

But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime üòÇ|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore .

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment. It does not work in poor, illiterate countries.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us.

And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.¬† I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  üòÇ (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can‚Äôt give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government.

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It‚Äôs disheartening!|||[deleted]|||What do you expect from a pageant queen?

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That‚Äôs not by accident, it‚Äôs calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn‚Äôt matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that‚Äôs been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women.

Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech.

So biswas ni ksari laus??|||Ai to the rescue|||Source?|||Could you provide proof that you did in fact study at harvard e.g a pic of your student id (you can cover any info that might lead you to your real identity) with your username written on a paper on the side or something like that just so we can prove you actually studied there in case they wanna call you a liar|||This is quite literally written by AI like word for word.

I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn‚Äôt a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that‚Äôs why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Usko personal tutor huncha and all Rey but come on it‚Äôs her age where she should be able to be a child.|||Concern is valid but we don‚Äôt have enough information to either justify or call it an exploitation yet. Aafno aafno opinion lai fact jasari prove garna nakhojam.   Questioning the tradition is valid and should be done. That‚Äôs how we will get more information on the practice and then we can determine whether the tradition is actually jeopardising the child‚Äôs mental health or not.   But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.   Anyways, I am open for a discussion and may be able to pose any questions to the people in the inner circle. I don‚Äôt know much myself but do have the connections if we want the facts so we can all stop conspiring.  Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime. Like I have never seen such a sad expression ever probably cause she cant smile or cry.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know).

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.¬†   Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.¬†   Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

Additionally, We don‚Äôt have practice of PM contesting for other smaller roles later in life. Maybe thats the reason he is not taking it.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger. You can only hope the rational one can eventually be the leader, and put the chaos and violence under control.|||You just need to re-steady the ship.

Congrats to all GenZ thinking this is some kind of revolution, you were controlled by deep state as usual.  Political instability causes far more problems than solutions.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal. All these people in power had to do was work towards uplifting of people rather exploit them, if they would have done 10% as well that would kept the citizens happy.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our country‚Äôs future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal‚Äôs journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.
