In Nepal, people often follow public figures blindly, assuming that if someone is seen as a ‚Äúhero,‚Äù their character must automatically be good.  Yes, Lamichhane was found not guilty, but that verdict came due to a lack of sufficient evidence, not because it was proven that nothing happened.

Singapore did not rise because of luck or slogans. It rose because its people accepted discipline, structure, and long-term vision, even when it was uncomfortable.  Nepal, sadly, seems to be heading in the opposite direction. We fought hard for democracy, for freedom, for rights. But somewhere along the way, we forgot that freedom without responsibility is self-destruction. Today, we can say anything, post anything, and do anything without consequence. What was once the voice of democracy has turned into the noise of disorder. We confuse outrage with awareness, and chaos with choice.  Look around and you will see it everywhere. People peeing on the streets, spitting in public, ignoring traffic lights, bribing officials to get their work done faster, and still blaming everything on ‚Äúbad leaders.‚Äù We fail to see that corruption is not only at the top; it begins within us. Giving a bribe is as much a crime as taking one. Our crisis is not just political; it is moral and cultural.  Freedom is beautiful, but when it comes without accountability, it breeds anarchy. Discipline is not a form of oppression it is the foundation on which a nation stands. The countries we admire today, such as Singapore, China, and even post-war South Korea, built their futures on order, not outrage. They accepted strong leadership and collective discipline, even when it meant individual discomfort. The result was growth, stability, and identity.  Nepal today, however, is driven by the wrong fuel. It is driven not by discipline but by social media, emotions, and narratives. We react to everything, think about nothing, and follow whoever shouts the loudest. Our national debates happen on TikTok and Facebook, not in classrooms or parliament. The danger is not that we will run out of freedom, but that we will drown in our own noise.  I fear that we are entering an era where the populist will triumph over the professional, where emotional speeches will defeat rational ideas. It is a sad truth, but Nepal has no Lee Kuan Yew. The closest we have is Harka Sampang a man with the heart of Lee Kuan Yew but without the mind/brain to match. He symbolizes our tragedy: passion without direction, courage without structure.  Meanwhile, many citizens are busy idolizing a so-called ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù sitting in jail, someone who has lived a life of controversy and even once renounced his Nepali identity. People follow him not for policy but for emotion, not for logic but for rebellion. This obsession with personalities over principles is the exact disease that destroys nations.  A country cannot be built on emotion alone. Emotions can ignite revolutions, but they cannot sustain them. Discipline, integrity, and intellect are what turn movements into nations. We need fewer loud heroes and more quiet builders people who repair roads before recording videos, who teach values before preaching patriotism, and who lead by example rather than outrage.  The truth is hard to accept, Nepal does not only lack leaders. It lacks disciplined citizens. A nation becomes strong not when its people defy the state but when both walk in balance. If citizens act responsibly and unite with shared purpose, they become more powerful than any government. But when citizens are divided by hate, driven by noise, and the state fears to enforce order, it becomes a failed one.  Unless we rediscover discipline, the very freedom we celebrate will keep destroying the nation we dream of building. Real freedom is not doing whatever we want. It is doing what is right, even when no one is watching. When looting becomes a proud moment and chaos a national celebration, it‚Äôs not freedom we‚Äôre living in; it‚Äôs decay disguised as democracy.",

For a Gen-Y like me, this is now about ensuring the generations that follow you have atleast the same opportunity. I'm now concerned about how my own children will get to grow up in this country.  The silver lining is that you won't lose much time to false optimism. You can leave this burning country behind while you're still young. Alternatively, you can fall back and join us in building our system brick by brick. It's a grinding, grueling process with no glory, but it's honest work. The journey ahead may take generations and will be filled with setbacks, but the progress is real, however incremental.  If you want to leave, prepare your exit. If you choose to stay, then preapre for an ungrateful and unpleasant journey.  I don't doubt your intentions were good, but the road to hell is paved with them.

I want to help a few people to see how this actually works in real life.  If interestes, I can look at one of your pages myself and tell you what is blocking it from ranking. I will also tell you what can be done to fix it.  I'm willing to do this for few people to see how clear the results will be for others.  Afterwards, If you want me to do a full site review, we can then discuss about the pricing.  If that sounds good, Comment below or feel free reach out.",

And now, Durga is doing the same thing, using Tanka Dahal to prepare for his next round of street protests. Meanwhile, the same old three power players ‚Äî ‡§π‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ KP Oli (UML), Gagan & Arzu Deuba (Congress), and Prachanda (Maoist) ‚Äî are once again using media like Kantipur ‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§™‡•Å‡§∞ and Annapurna Post for their own manipulation and propaganda.

Durga Prasai now has HTP Khabar-‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∂‡§æ‡§π, and recently even Tanka Dahal on his side.  So why are all these ‡§ù‡•ã‡§≤‡•á acting like uneducated men? Be educated, think logically.

Thousands of people flooded their posts with abuse, using words like ‚Äúwhore,‚Äù ‚Äúrape them,‚Äù ‚Äúdie,‚Äù and ‚Äúrip them apart.‚Äù These weren‚Äôt just anonymous trolls hiding behind fake profiles. These were ordinary people students, professionals, even parents publicly writing things that cross every line of decency. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs truly frightening.  We like to call ourselves a kind, respectful, and empathetic society. But our behavior online tells a different story. The moment someone makes a mistake, disagrees, or expresses a different opinion, the mob descends. We don‚Äôt debate; we destroy.  And this digital rage doesn‚Äôt exist in isolation. It‚Äôs the same emotion we saw spill onto the streets on September 9, when the country burned, when crowds looted and vandalized in broad daylight. The only difference now is that the fire burns behind screens, fueled by blind anger, amplified by algorithms, and unchecked by accountability.  This is why Nepal urgently needs social media moderation and legal accountability. Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt mean freedom to threaten, abuse, or defame. Platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram cannot keep pretending to be neutral when they knowingly allow hate and harassment to thrive. There must be laws that clearly define the boundaries of online behavior and consequences for those who cross them.  Maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink how we use social media altogether. It shouldn‚Äôt be a lawless space where anyone can create countless fake accounts and act without responsibility. Perhaps user verification, even something as simple as linking accounts with the National ID (NID), could make people accountable for their actions. Not to strip privacy, but to ensure responsibility. Because when someone spreads false information, threatens others, or incites violence, like when Rajeev Khatri encouraged people to break the jail, that‚Äôs no longer free expression. It‚Äôs a crime.  Having a voice is a right. But having a loud voice is also a responsibility. If you misuse that voice, whether you‚Äôre a public figure or an ordinary user, you should face the consequences.  Because what we‚Äôre witnessing in Nepal‚Äôs digital space today is not freedom. It‚Äôs digital anarchy.",

I know it's too harsh of a thing to implement, but with this technology access to every individual out there which provides anonymity to certain extent, it's a necessary thing now. Privacy isn't more important than safety.  Online threats, inhumane content, leaks of private medias, scams, etc are really more serious issues than privacy. If anyone is serious about finding your identity, your current form of internet anonymity cannot really prevent you unless you're really really invested in keeping yourself anonymity. But with current internet anonymity which prevents immediate identity exposure, any idiot thinks he is anonymous and post whatever they feel like which they'll never dare to do it irl.",

            "body": "Sandy, you really outdid yourself this time. One day you‚Äôre ‚Äúprotecting your dignity,‚Äù the next you‚Äôre lecturing YouTubers about morality while your own fanbase floods the internet with threats and abuse in your name. Irony called; it wants its crown back.  Let‚Äôs get real. Paradygm didn‚Äôt invent your controversy, **you** did. And now, instead of introspection, we get a Facebook rant about ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù and ‚Äúcharacter assassination.‚Äù No, Sandy. That‚Äôs not a conspiracy. That‚Äôs a consequence. You can‚Äôt play the victim of public opinion when you wrote the script yourself.  And the funniest part? The same Sandy who‚Äôs crying about people ‚Äúmocking‚Äù his life is now silently watching his stans do exactly that to the women and creators who merely scratched the surface of the topic. Harassment, rape threats, mockery, insults, death wishes, all in your defence. So tell me, Sandy, are you going to post another essay about that? Or does ‚Äúshame on you‚Äù only apply when someone else talks back?  The women and creators you‚Äôve defamed aren‚Äôt sitting quietly. They will be documenting everything, the messages, the threats, the slander. And if needed, they‚Äôll file actual cases of actual defamation, unlike a mere mention of your rape charges in a YouTube video.  Defamation, online harassment, cyberbullying, death threats, rape threats, and name-calling. Real legal action, not dramatic Facebook paragraphs. You will suffer because of your actions.  So, Sandy, here‚Äôs a tip: before you start crying ‚Äúassassination of character,‚Äù maybe stop letting your followers do the same thing you claim to hate. You‚Äôre not the victim of a smear campaign; you‚Äôre the author of your own downfall.  Keep talking, Sandy. Every post digs the hole deeper. And this time, it‚Äôs not the internet that‚Äôll judge, it‚Äôs the law, the people who know what defamation is and what's not.",

That girl, we grew up to be good friends until she left the school I passed out from the same school every time I used to walk by Montessori section and saw that teacher it used to remind me of this giving me second hand embarrassment even after years and now I saw that girl in facebook which again reminded me of this. I remember completely random events like this for no reason and in so detail for that age, many of those event are so weird like line by line conversation I had with my mom about a food truck we saw coming towards us, I was like 3,4 years old and I recall them sometimes completely randomly or sometimes through events or memory that leads to those. I am 20 years old now and still recall some events from my childhood in specific detail that I had in my memory involuntarily thanks to my adhd I still get random flashbacks for no reasons but this is the most weirdest one.",

This was like wayy back, when i was like 11 or 12 yrs old, and i lived in chitwan.  To set the scene up, i lived in this building which had like 4 apartments, and just behind the building was a bigg garden where people used to like grow their own crops and stuff, and just 5/6 meters away from it was a river. And some people that were inhabitant of that place purkhau purkha bata, used to say its not good to go to that river especially during nights or even in day time if u were alone and all, they used to say people would get haunted if they do.  But me and my friend group would always go teta tirra, well not to the river but near it time to time to play hide and seek lol. One night in summer after we were done playing, i felt this chill down my spine and ruled it out as being nothing serious. I went home, had dinner and i slept.  So, my room had windows that faced directly to the garden, and as it is super hot in chitwan i used to open that window for air. At around midnight i woke up, went to restroom and tried to sleep, but i couldnt because i felt like someone was watching me constantly. i felt that way for like few minutess. Ani i was scared asf. I thought i should wake up my parents, soo i mustered up courage and got up and boy ohh boy.  I looked at the the window, and saww a man like figure directly staring at me. I couldnt see his face but it was a dark figure just standing there facing me. It had like semi long hairr, abnormally large build, and had only one hand. And boy i was soo scared i couldnt even scream. Tyoo huncha ni mind nai shut huney jasto. I dunno how but i switched my lights on and there was nothing there.  Tespachi i woke my parents up told em everything scared asf. First they were like kei haina darayera testo dekheko bhaneyra. But i got sick after that day. Ani they brought someone fukna ko lagey using mantra and shit, and i became fine after that. I never opened that window after that.|||Euta incident yaad aayo.

Fair enough, I couldn‚Äôt offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I‚Äôve heard things like ‚ÄúYesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo‚Äù. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn‚Äôt change.  I‚Äôve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn‚Äôt complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I‚Äôd had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I‚Äôm not done yet. Maybe there‚Äôs still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn‚Äôt choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I‚Äôve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn‚Äôt finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It‚Äôs tough, but I‚Äôm thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don‚Äôt need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn‚Äôt possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don‚Äôt know where I am, but one day I‚Äôll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second handüòÅ) all this within just one year. I can‚Äôt believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re.

Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it‚Äôs ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla.

Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency.

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I‚Äôm focusing more on my personal growth and learning ‚Äî I‚Äôve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I‚Äôm mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed ‚Äî personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I‚Äôve finally come out the other side. I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That‚Äôs the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn‚Äôt always mean money. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just appreciating someone‚Äôs efforts. Sometimes, it‚Äôs being there for someone who‚Äôs lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I‚Äôve even tried helping a few people here (and if you‚Äôre one of them, don‚Äôt feel awkward). I just want to say this: there‚Äôs so much more to life than just these things.

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it‚Äôs 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I‚Äôm happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He‚Äôs an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn‚Äôt benefit from it.  My father isn‚Äôt happy here  It‚Äôs been over 10 years and he‚Äôd say that if I said I wanna go back he‚Äôll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) ‚ÄúTell your father this. ‚ÄòDad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?‚Äô If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He‚Äôs here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him ‚Äîjust him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn‚Äôt want to leave his family here‚Äù  I then said ‚Äúdad‚Äôs gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That‚Äôs what he said‚Äù  Grandma ‚Äúhe said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you‚Äôre always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn‚Äù   Me ‚Äúbut, I like it here‚Äù  Grandma  ‚ÄúDo you love your dad or not? He‚Äôs done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He‚Äôs 53 now. Come to Nepal. I‚Äôve got money to pay for your school fees‚Äù  That‚Äôs when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it‚Äôs especially hard in the hot son as he‚Äôs an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn‚Äôt like it heere and he‚Äôs much happier everytime we‚Äôre in Nepal.  My dad did say ‚Äúwe should‚Äôve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick‚Äù But I‚Äôm 23 now  And I don‚Äôt wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He‚Äôs an amazing person who‚Äôs gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say ‚ÄúI want to go back to Nepal‚Äù he‚Äôll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the ‚Äúpower‚Äù but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here‚Äôs what she said ‚ÄúYour dad is 50 now. He‚Äôs been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don‚Äôt let me stop you but if I was in your place, I‚Äôd come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors‚Äù  I hate it. Also my grandma isn‚Äôt a bad person  My aunties  1 is in US 2 are in Canada  And 1 is in Nepal  So grandma lives Alone The auntie that‚Äôs in Nepal stays with her.  So Idk what to do I‚Äôve got an Australian license. I‚Äôve built a life here  I‚Äôm studying and don‚Äôt work atm  I‚Äôm an Australian citizen I wanna cry. I feel like I‚Äôve failed as a daughter.",

If he has worked so hard for you all these time he definitely understands that. Don't listen to others opinion and have a proper talk with your dad, that's the only way to navigate through this dilemma. Best of luck hope everything works out in your favor.|||U have family in Nepal that care about your father. U have lived in Australia for more than u lived in Nepal. I'm sure ur family here had good in their hearts in regards to your father but they also can't expect u to uproot your whole life for it.|||Nope ur not. as much as what your dad has done for u is undeniable but ur your own person not him or his extension. Ur free to choose as you like. Would it make him happy if u agreed? Of course. But that's your choice to make.|||Hey, Nepal aara 1/2 mahina basera farkine ho vane ramro xa afanta vetinxa garinxa but permanently are you sure?

You can be happy in Aus, he can be happy in Nep. Both of you can visit each other every so often. It's time for you to leave the nest anyways.|||No. Anyone who says \"oh your dad's done so much for you\" and tries to blackmail you is a terrible person.   Also, move to Nepal and do what? You grew up in Australia.. you're more in touch with Australia than you are with Nepal...   Its a parent's job to provide for their children... they're not doing you as a favor, that's literally their responsibility.  Maybe once he's older then sure, if you want to take care of him go ahead. But he's a fully capable man, fully capable of living on his own.   You're only 23, you should be traveling, having fun, focusing on your career.. not worrying about what people in Nepal think.|||Grandmom sounds like a manipulative person tbh hearing your replies and stuff.  Baru have an open convo with your dad with what your grandmom is saying.  Do you really think he‚Äôd want you to sacrifice your education, career, your life after he‚Äôs worked to hard all his life to provide for you?|||Your father isn‚Äôt that old. He can definitely live alone (if he doesn‚Äôt have anyone here in Nepal) for 15 years at least and you both can visit each other in the meantime.|||Looking at your replies to other comments, it seems like you have already made up your mind. Are you just here looking for validation that you are right?|||Whats wrong coming here for a while, mountains are calling anyway.|||Think about your future is what I will say.

Don't let your emotions ruin your future ahead.¬† ¬† ¬†|||It‚Äôs simple: J sukai gara! It doesn‚Äôt matter. There is no right or wrong options here. You are a nice daughter anyways since you are thinking for him, thinking about him. Nothing else matters. Tetai basey ni it‚Äôs good. Farkey ni it‚Äôs good.

If you can't, just tell that to father.|||Your dad took you to Australia when you were 10 , you didn‚Äôt get to choose what you wanted. Now you are 23 and he and his family is manipulating you to move back to Nepal. Sorry girl, but you are being played like a ping pong ball here. Kaile kata kaile kata. I know you love him tara at the end of the day it is your life. If you don‚Äôt like it in Nepal you will never forgive your dad coz you will feel like he caused that misery and maybe your relationship with him will also go down hill. You need to have a proper conversation with him and let him choose. He can‚Äôt have both haath ma laddu, you plus his want to go back to Nepal. For once, be selfish and choose what you want.|||if you can afford, you can come to Nepal with your family and enjoy a vacation here but not fast paced khale. Spare some time like a month or so and enjoy a laid back life for some days. He is probably exhausted being in a foreign land. But you can have your own preferences of living here or there permanently.|||I have seen many cases like that. Send your father Nepal for few years I bet you $1000 he will be back to Australia. My friend family leave USA for good because his parents wanna go back to Nepal. They purchase land and properties and lived for 3 years in Nepal but they‚Äôre back again in US after selling their house and land.   They can‚Äôt live without their kids. And their kids basically grown up in US. They love and know US more then they know about Nepal.|||Your dad ‚Äòsacrificed‚Äô for you, you will ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô for your kid, such is life. I am sure your dad understands this. Stop letting old people guilt trip you to do things you aren‚Äôt comfortable doing. Talk to your dad! Always remember, most of us internet strangers are stupid af, especially in this sub, so take every comment here with a grain of salt.|||honestly i haven't read half of what you have written but i will say:  We all acknowledge your father love toward his motherland. but nepal isn't so good in condition rn basic facilites are expensive and hard to get. So stay there now for the sake of your brother and when you start to earn to support your family send your parents here the facilites maybe less but the pleasure is unmatched anywhere in the world. and seeing your condition you might me a australian citizen even so visit nepal sometimes and never forget your motherland and who you are.   \\[Just some emotional and logical dialogues your father will melt thinking my daughter is matured enough to say this and stay happily.\\]   you can dm if you want any help. :)|||I'm kind of in the same situation as you, same age but male in Canada. Both of my parents are pushing 50 and want to go back to Nepal and take me with them, but I've chosen to live here and let them go back to Nepal when my little brother is grown up. The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.  Another reason for you to not go back if your gender. You have more rights and freedoms in Australia than you do in Nepal, and you might not get used to the regressive expectations that native Nepalis have for women.|||No offense, but it seems like she's engaging in some extremely manipulative behavior.   P.S. I don't know the whole story. This is just the feeling I got from reading this post. I might be completely wrong.|||You father will not want to destroy your life and career and come to Nepal. Stay there make a good living come back 10 yrs later retire early.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.|||Don‚Äôt feel anything bad about yourself. Its his decision and not yours.   Years ago he was coerced by your mom and now your grandma wants you to coerce him back to Nepal. I don‚Äôt know what it is with the ladies of your household but I think he has to make his own decision   Every parent makes  sacrifices and if you become one you will too. And what if father you go back what about your brother ? It is what it is . If he wanted to leave he should have done years ago. Complete your studies first and than think what you should do? And don‚Äôt feel guilty about anything, this situation isn‚Äôt of your making and you shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice your studies or career for this. Your father will never be able to forgive himself.|||It is hard to deal with manipulation from adult family as we get older. As children our adult family are our guides and heroes. When we grow we start to learn they are flawed people just like everyone. But learning to handle their manipulation will make you stronger. You are an adult now and allowed to make decisions about your own life and how you live it   Maybe you can find some way to help your father enjoy Australia more? Is he involved with the nepali community? Maybe he can do a hobby or a sport? Enjoy some day trips on the weekend to parks or gardens|||Don't let your dad's sacrifice go to vain. He endured to give you the opportunity, don't let it go to waste.|||Hi, I cant provide the solution. But I am an engineer and currently living in Australia. Can you ask your dad to provide job refrence to me please. That will mean alot to me. Thankyou|||Never needed to post this as your grandmother and cousin said it best but if you really want to make your happy, convince your mother to consider her husband‚Äôs happiness too as you said he‚Äôs not happy and you should complete your studies. Consult with your family about each others needs but for you tell them that you are considering to go back to Nepal temporarily but will return as even after completing studies you won‚Äôt get better job opportunities in Nepal and even then you‚Äôll visit your family.

He's always talked about his instance on corruption, called for investigation all the cases regardless of which party the alleged politicians belong to. He's always talked about how the top three leaders have ruined democracy and has established themselves as face of this system that has made people hate this system. He's said same thing in this interview too, and suddenly people are back to supporting him? So they actually never watched his interviews and just hopped in 'gagan hate club' or what?  If he hadn't been fighting against status quo (deuba gang) inside Nepali Congress, Gagan would've have been minister more than 6-7 times for sure. He actually should've done that in my opinion. his only executive role ever was a 9-10 month as health minister as far as I know.  Also, I might be called jholey as there are many RSP supporters here, and blame gagan for rabi being jailed which is so funny to me. you think the district courts, the high court and supreme court (which denied his habeas corpus writ) were bought? not one , not two but all three tier of courts? I don't buy that rabi is being kept in custody without any proof. Also, why did rabi not investigate Gagan for his bakhra chor case while he was home minister?",

Why couldn't he speak about that with the same audacity he spoke with while accusing rabi? Contrastingly, Rabi and RSP had suspended and later fired Dakha Prasad (former RSP member) when he was proven guilty of corruption.  Why don't we trust Gagan? That's because he still belongs to Nepali Congress. If he is to gain any of our trust, he'll have to rebrand himself with a new party. That's the least he could do.  What's the problem with Nepali Congress, the party? See, we all agree to the fact that the deep rooted curruption is the main single reason why our country is still undeveloped. It's not one single person or few. It's the ecosystem of corruption from govt colleges to hospitals, peon to the dean, the studens, different organs of government CIIA, judiciary you name it, basically everywhere and this is really concerning. (I'm not ranting only on Nepali Congress but all the other 2 as well). We need new faces who don't have their jholeys in these different organs and offices of government. Do you really think Gagan will disregard NSU in an attempt to eradicate student politics? Do you really think he'll file an investigation against Deuba or Lekhak? We don't. We simply don't.|||He has been in politics for decade just like his sugar daddy Deuba.   If only he was willing to do good, he could start with improving/developing his own election district. Did he?

Like you said, the only thing Gagan Thapa does is call for investigation, says that yes changes needs to made within his party, that's it. Nothing else can be expected of him. Also he became Health Minsiter once, that too I guess decades back, so Idk why people keep bringing that up again and again as if it was revolutionary.   Also I was just using twitter, and someone said that they watched the entire episode, and yes, there's nothing new. It's the same thing he has been saying since years.   I don't like this guy at all these days, and it's because he's all bark no bite kinda person. Also he dosen't speak regarding issues until last minute. Also if it's his party member involved, he won't speak at all. Even if he does, he will repeat the same old dialogue of Yes investigation must happen.   Literally few days back his party leader Deuba said without any shame that the videos from his home is nothing but AI, all those money clips are AI generated. This shows that he thinks Nepali people are nothing but fools. And this Gagane and co, non of them dared to question it. They all just accepted it. I can go on and on about how this Gagan Thapa has been silent when his party was involved. And how he will be the first to shout if opposition does anything. Another comment by the user u/bhalu-dai has explained this.   Also he should stop trying to potray himself as youth. That's what he has been doing since decades and still trying to milk the same narrative.|||I‚Äôll wait for the NC General Convention and judge him then.

But, Gagan is the only way forward for Nepali Congress for sure.

Maoists are losing supporter base ( even more if Prachanda resigns ) and UML might be on the same track after Oli ( UML is more of a leader specific party ).

Every industry ma revolution chaieko cha Nepal ma.|||I studied in an international school in Nepal up until I was 16.I managed to do 1 year gcse in UK. Two years Alevels and 4 years uni in pharmacy. The background I had academically from Nepal was fine. I‚Äôm 33 of age now. My school and parents were quite strict on me so I pushed myself hard academically but I would say I wasn‚Äôt able to develop well in other skills. However there are plenty of people who are able to gain those skills in Nepal.   School was very toxic with physical and emotional abuse, discrimination, zero freedom and not very nurturing apart from just bullying you to study. I found in UK there are other opportunities, if you didn‚Äôt want to go the uni route. I also like they try to prepare you for work experience and building other hard and soft skills.  I do feel there is some change in Nepal now hopefully as I can see many young people trying different routes and perspective seem to be shifting.    I am also thinking of soft retiring and trying my luck in Nepal. Pay is definitely not comparable but the cushion you have from your savings in Uk may go a long way. I believe the pay is very basic in healthcare if you don‚Äôt own your business but may be enough to sustain yourself  I have heard of consultant doctors getting paid 50k to only 1 lakh but there is less restrictions in Nepal. It not very regulated like in Uk and a lot less rules to follow. Maybe testing it out for 6 months might give you a feel of what it‚Äôs like ? It will also depend a lot on your personality. I stayed in Nepal for 6 months and hardly missed UK but some of other friends would hate it.   Lastly, My parents managed to retire in Nepal for the last 7 years and they love it in Ktm.|||Try for Aus, Ireland or other countries first, stash 300-500k and then retire in Nepal; I know easier said than done but that's my plan as well. Nepal is absolutely the place to retire, raise kids and for people who've grown up there, there's nothing quite like it, but poverty sucks as well. So I highly recommend stashing away atleast a 100k before returning to Nepal. 100k will earn you 8-10k of interest a year which is enough for basic expenses and a job that pays 50 thousand rupees a month would be a good supplement. By retire I mean mid 30's to at most 40. If you wait any longer to return to Nepal, I feel like you've missed a good chunk of life. I know its a tall order but try to save as much as you can in the next 5-10 years and it will really enhance the QOL back home.|||As someone who  once moved back from a \"developed\" country to Nepal, only to leave again after a few years, these are my observations. I'll try and be as objective as possible.  - The work culture is different. You're expected to kowtow to your seniors and to management. There is little concern for your well-being. You can say it's not very different from the UK, but the frustration will set in when you have to make a case for every sick leave, when your performance reviews etc are decided on the basis of who you know/connect with rather than on merit. - Work-life balance is pretty much non-existent, unless you find a kind manager/supervisor. You're expected to put work before family.  - Purchasing power is obviously better and you can buy services, i.e get someone to do your chores for you, if you're so inclined.  -  Less freedom of movement. You can probably go to a seaside town or on a long drive in the UK on a day off. Good luck buying a car for transport with a nurse's salary in Nepal. If you chose to take public transport, good luck with that too. Unfortunately, you also have to watch out for yourself if you're a woman. You'll have to be more conscious of what you wear and where you go.  - International travel? Fancy a weekend trip to a different country, perhaps? Good luck! - what i found the most frustrating was the (lack of) basics and how you are expected to get along without them. Power cuts, water problems sometimes, hot showers are a luxury. Things we don't have to think twice about while living in the developed world.  - basic cleanliness. Can't enter a public restroom without coming close to puking. Even the nicest restaurants have stinky as toilets. Roads are lined with litter. You have to watch every step while walking on the roads and if it rains, the entire city/town becomes a mudpit.  - you mentioned rising racism where you are. Nepal does have a plus there- you won't be treated like a second class citizen. - i also love traveling around Nepal. It calms me and it's definitely a profound experience. But it's a lot easier to do when you are earning in dollars/pounds and travel while on paid leaves, as opposed to when you're earning in rupees.  I can go on forever, but the decision is obviously yours and your experience might be very different from mine. You might find it all rewarding and decide it was worth it in the future, once you get past the initial frustration.  Good luck with whatever you do!|||Also, how is the education system? My brother is a whole 18 years younger than me so I don‚Äôt want to absolutely ROB him of opportunities. To be honest, I do have faith in the Nepali system and I know quality comes at an extra cost (unfortunately) which I don‚Äôt mind covering because it‚Äôs just him and I‚Äôm not fussed about all that money drama. I‚Äôm set on being childless so may as well financially support his upbringing. My parents have been here since 2000 and 2003 (laure/military dependant route) and have been working ever since. My dad had an early retirement for health so it‚Äôs not been glamour, work wise army bata niklesi. I want them to be comfortable in Nepal without staying in the UK for another two decades for the little one. That‚Äôs too much labour. I have thought of keeping him here with me and letting my parents stay in Nepal but 1. They wouldn‚Äôt do that 2. He needs parents for his emotional development. Nepal is the best option. I care about my career but I also wouldn‚Äôt kill my mental health for it.¬†  Note: For any Bhai haru looking to become British laures, PLEASE do a degree or get a qualification of some sort army ma huda because the army will pay for it. I know QGE fund engineering degrees and signals fund cybersecurity? There is not that much support after retirement and if you don‚Äôt plan ahead now, it‚Äôs hard to get by. I‚Äôve seen it firsthand. 20 years go like a flash.|||Heyy , I know 2 of my friends who were born and brought up in US and UK and have shifted to Nepal permanently.   One from US use to work as a lawer there , she left states because she was not happy with her life style and just like u said she use to work 10 hours a day and was still not satisfied with finance and other facilities. She runs an INGO here . My second friend from UK kinda stays both the places , she shuffle between London and chitwan , she shifted here after she completed her studies , she is into technology business here .   About me . I was also born and brought up in India (not like western countries but still not Nepal ), I also shifted here some 15 years ago after I completed my graduation, my Nepali was not that fluent back then . I did face few challenges here and there in the beginning but honestly every one here is so lovely and cooperative that u will never realise the hard ship. Since then I have travelled to different parts of Nepal , have made zillions of friends and have carved my own name . I am into hospitality business here .

Sell yourself to others.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||My husband moved from one FAANG to the other one and both times either the recruiter or the hiring manager reached out to him on LinkedIn.

            "body": "I recently completed my Bachelor's in IT with Distinction and am currently working as a Web Developer earning around 45K/month. But now, I‚Äôm in a dilemma: should I pursue my Master‚Äôs in Nepal or go abroad (thinking USA or Australia)? My long term goal is to land a solid job in the IT with a good package (around 4‚Äì5 lakh/month), and build strong network.  If I stay in Nepal, I can probably manage an IT job alongside my Master's and even try applying for remote jobs abroad later on. But I fear that the Nepali masters degree in IT won't be that serious and wont open much doors for me. Whereas, if I go abroad (Targeting USA/AUS), I might be benefited with great exposure, networking, etc. But what I fear is I might not get to focus on studies and even IT altogether due to side job (Non IT) that we have to do for survival there. And I might get diverted from tech to other domain of jobs. Let me know if its not the case. What I want is to stay in IT domain.  So, what should be the best approach for my target? Are there Nepali people, who have built a good career in IT at abroad by studying there alone? Or, is it better to study here and land a better package later on? Any advice would be highly appreciated.  Fyi, like most typical Nepali families, my parents expect me to go abroad, but they‚Äôre supportive enough to agree with my decision if I know what I‚Äôm doing.",

I don't think masters in Nepal is worth it since its as you stated; not so serious and doesn't open much doors but even abroad i don't think degree alone does that. The degree doesn't do it abroad but the location might do it depending on where you go to study.  So I decided that if I am joining masters then its going to be somewhere nice and I won't have to worry about basic survival needs. So to have a better understanding of the whole thing and also to have some financials setup, I decided to take a gap year, work for a year or so, do some research on where i can get universities with either full scholarships or close to that (including assistantship or RA/TA positions).

Aba they‚Äôll say I‚Äôm being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let‚Äôs go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn‚Äôt the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it‚Äôs easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it‚Äôs ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I‚Äôm more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn‚Äôt offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I‚Äôve heard things like ‚ÄúYesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo‚Äù. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn‚Äôt change.  I‚Äôve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn‚Äôt complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I‚Äôd had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I‚Äôm not done yet. Maybe there‚Äôs still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn‚Äôt choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I‚Äôve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn‚Äôt finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It‚Äôs tough, but I‚Äôm thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don‚Äôt need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn‚Äôt possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don‚Äôt know where I am, but one day I‚Äôll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second handüòÅ) all this within just one year. I can‚Äôt believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!! Pic 7 year ago this day.  My last bhai tika.",

Both were done by the West through TV and meta apps, and yet we are too stubborn to see it because of our ego. And still, people want to die for those- they worship blindly, but not for their own kings. Kings -especially the Shah dynasty, were the true heirs of this country. They are literally the founders of this nation, and yet this generation doesn‚Äôt realize it.   If we don‚Äôt realize why we are in a mess today, then we shouldn‚Äôt call the UN for help when things get worse in the future and believe me, it will. And the matter of fact, the UN doesn‚Äôt truly exist for justice; pedo-elites are at the top hierarchy.  We are not a developed country because we try to copy the West and their agendas to go against India and China, which are now two supergiants. The media also played its part well, creating division through religion, caste, and gender. Nothing like that should exist in a free world. God is one source-energy and eternal, yet we are too brainwashed to see the truth.  This isn‚Äôt the same Nepal that we once cherished and loved. Our history is slowly turning into ashes, and we‚Äôre enjoying every bit of it without understanding the true hidden agendas. We always say \"Sati le sarape ko desh\" but we never tried to search for truth and be educated of our history.

All of them give bullshit why king is necessary,¬† doing stage talk where they bring their own people and do prentend interview. They talk bullshit and conclude why king is necessary in the end. They want to force everyone to accept King and fantasize death of those who resist their movement. Those people are now acting under the directive of Swagat Nepal through his daughter Mikaka previously known as Chimekki aunty.¬†   Koirala: https://www.instagram.com/ashbinkoirala/   Mikasa: https://www.instagram.com/chhimeki_aunty/   SYD: https://www.instagram.com/free_from_vanity_/  Bhrikuti: https://www.instagram.com/sanyukta_suman/  Bhimsen, Wolfie and Annony currently resides outside Nepal and they are hiding their identity in public. Koirala currently residing at Australia gives a sermon how he worked in shady industry at Australia working with shady Nepali people. Bhimsen sounds someone from Madesh-Terai who bluffs of studying but is clearly bullshiting, Anony sounds like he is high smoking hash or in drugs, Wolfie sounds like pandit-pujari also at USA studying talks highly about Trump and forming Right wing political party in Nepal.

Create a single point failure and see what happens in modern time. Outdated blood based rulers if someone supports this they are either too close to the family back then and it up rooted their livelihood leeching off the monarchy crumbs or Andha Bhakt Ultra Hindu Nationalist believing King is divine.   The Sept 8-9 movement is against corrupt politicians and their cronies, the ask was simple make public institutions trustworthy, give us reason to stay in Nepal work, live and be happy. \"Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness\" which is literally the core of people's democracy.  Protested and people died for leveling off the playing field, cronyism and political corruption against thyo, people want to bring back OG cronies who were above the law in the name of \"nationalism\".  We protested specifically because 3 taukey seems to be above the law but brain dead rajabadi want someone instead of them also above the law. And their thick skulls don't see an the irony with that.|||Hamroma ajhai pani feudalism ko mentality gakai xaina, tei vayera ta yo party haru eti arajak huna pakothyo|||Fuck monarcy aabaa yo jaamana ma raja ko xora raja hudaina -sakai|||It was never about GenZ it was all just a ploy by Rajabadi to destablize the government so that it is primed for Raja|||Slave mentality|||Oh wait bro. Do you really think at this moment you are not slave ? Bro this is a problem with democracy. Democracy work in such a way that it seems like democracy but it is dictatorship. During the removal of monarchy just see how many people died there and now see how many people die. You can see the clear difference. After the end of monarchy the king silently returned but now see the attitude of this KP baze. The is pretending to be greater then king. So Who is the king? And are you a slave or not now? I am also not pro monarchy but if you could build a democratic system which is really a democratic then it's Great. But the single fact is, it is not possible. About Hindu rastha I am a  Atheist. But still I support Hindu rastha. Do you know why. The first step to break any country is to remove the pride for there culture and religion. So the establishment of Christianity is not random it is heavily planned. So Just to protect the country I am with Hindu rastha even being atheist.Yep monarchy was not good and evil before but I think it will work better cause of fear of People. They saw many people protest and Foreign intervention. So I hove they can rule better. And what's different in the political party and Monarchy. Only one difference, Political party is for certain time so they have the concept to just take a bribe and collect a lot of money for future retirement and there children. But for King they are permanent and there pride is associated from the standard of their country. One person of 100billion dollar networth VS a King with 100billiondollar GDP. In this case the king will have more pride. At last I don't know whether the monarchy will be good for our country or not but I know It can never go more worst than this. Edit:    Also one point is Our country Just need Stability and some long term vision. Other Development can be easily done by the youth of Nepal.|||Raja Huda, ko chai slave thyo ra pahila ü§î|||Gyanu le affai ma aaudina vandai cha ta. Kina attirako bro",

            "body": "The Patan High Court acquitted Sandeep Lamichhane on May 15, 2024, overturning the Kathmandu District Court's December 2023 conviction and January 2024 eight-year sentence.  The court's reasoning, centered on insufficient evidence to prove rape, the victim's adult status (**not a minor**), and contextual factors suggesting **consent** or ulterior motives rather than coercion. And she was 18 and he was 22 during the time of the incident.  Here are the details released by the court about the case:  1. Victim was 18+ and lied about her age 2. The girl checked into the room while Sandeep was parking, and they were holding hands leaving the hotel after the alleged rape based on CCTV evidence reviewed by the court. 3. The girl had a boyfriend and told her roommate she needed sponsorship from Sandeep 4. The accuser asked her roommate to lie to her boyfriend about her whereabouts.  5. While out with Sandeep, the roommate checked in; accuser said everything was going well, with no distress signals. 6. She lied to the roommate about returning home, saying Sandeep would drop her at a friend's place to hide spending the night. 7. The roommate testified that, upon returning the next morning, the victim appeared joyful and soon began enthusiastically following Lamichhane's cricket matches. 8. The roommate overheard the victim on a phone call post-fallout (after Lamichhane left for cricket abroad without fulfilling promises), discussing extracting \"at least 10-15 lakhs\" via a legal case. 9. The roommate (a key witness) provided the bulk of behavioral and motive evidence during appeal hearings. Combined with CCTV (demanding voluntary check-in/exit), social media logs (victim-initiated contact), and lack of physical proof of force, it led to the **clean acquittal.**  Plus, **fck Paradigm TV** and the brain rot content and 'influencers' that they promote in their channel. I noticed their viewership is slowly dying, so this controversy might be a good thing for them to become a little relevant but the audience are smarter now and see right through these people.",

So next time you resort to it, learn to put your head down, and look for that light in the end of the tunnel\". I'm afraid I'm in no position to type in devnagiri, but it sounded even more rousing in Nepali.  Your mileage may vary. But acknowledging you have a chance to make something out of yourself is concrete, palpable, and actionable.  Make no mistake, I hate mincing words: when depressed, remember all the lives that are designated to a mere existence, not the ones that thrive. It'll remind you to be motivated enough to put yourself out of that circumstance.  Here's an advice: Get to a point where you're able to self sustain. Sure, the few years are going to suck, but you'll be happier. Move out of there asap.|||There are people who actually read it all. Leave it be such comments. Rant here often and vent it out , take advice  If it's the environment that's toxic to you , you have no option but to have acceptance of it being such and then changing the very environment is the only way you can thrive again in life .  You have to find the way out . Make the change . Be determined.  The darkness and spiral of depressive mind will try to bring things down but you have to be stronger than that. There is no other way .

This is all I can say now; sadly as I don‚Äôt know the context.|||The amount of men supporting him in the comments of Paradygm TV is legit scary. He might've been acquitted by the court upon appeal, but that does not prove his innocence. It is so frustrating how the burden of proof is upon the victim.    Fans acting as if his cricket skills makeup for the fact that he raped a minor and if you don't believe it, he still had sex with a barely 18-year-old girl, who was poor and star struck by the guy. This happens way too often where athletes misuse their fame and influence.    We are not unaware of how easily influential people in Nepal get away with anything, they've gotten away with hit-and-runs, DUIs, this is only a rape of a girl, they already care less. It is disgusting how he was even allowed to play and still represented Nepal while he had an ongoing case. This is why victims don't come forward.    But of course guys would have no regard for that girl, because for most guys the number of rapes happening is merely a statistic BUT for almost every woman, it is a reality that they could be exposed to at any time. I definitely believe the girl more, I think she was a victim.       People complain about false allegations but according to studies, \"False rape allegations are rare, with studies consistently finding that approximately 2% to 10% of reports are proven false.¬†Rigorous research indicates the rate is typically between 2% and 8%.¬†The perception that false allegations are common is largely a myth that can discourage real victims from reporting sexual violence.\" Rape allegations ruin a woman's life more than it ruins a man, even though he's the perpetrator! The victims rarely get justice and the rapists still get to live their life out large.

He definitely deserve a belt treatment the way he behaves off screen  And the amount of people who are still defending him are absolute clowns, just because he plays for your team doesn't mean he is right in every scenario.|||These paradygm mf deserve every hate   every second content is about sex and never liked their content   kathmandu ko elite haru lerayera Nepal represent gareko vanthiyo khate haru le|||Really shows how fragile Nepali men egos are.

Maiti Nepal also happened to shelter the victim of Lamichane case.   I remember the backlash and hate she got from the so callled influencers and fans that are unbelievable. They attempt to tarnish her image. Her citizenship was questioned. She was accused of being a foreign agent, INGO, and NGO dalal.  The narratives have been set that INGO and NGO are bad.

So if a girl accuses someone then should they be hanged and cursed until the generations to come? Should they and their family be prosecuted publicly and maybe do the walk of shame like in GoT and something worse? What should be done after someone is acuused? Should there be not court processing and just proceed to punishment?  The jury could have been bought and there might of some wrong doing. But do any of us have proof of it?

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

But to be in the situation is already a failure. We already failed when there was a situation to choose between life and property. The situation shouldn't have arisen at the first place. And the army doesn't have all the blame to take. Lord knows what security council was busy in. What purpose does a security council serve if it cannot hold a meeting in emergency. Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own. If army was mobilised timely, airport would probably not be the only safe place.|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Best took the best decision in that day, every step taken was well done !|||Khoi k vanne eti dherai question haru xan.

A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** ‚Äî locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** ‚Äî many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** ‚Äî more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** ‚Äî national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal‚Äôs total land** is covered by forests ‚Äî up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?

Sell yourself to others.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||My husband moved from one FAANG to the other one and both times either the recruiter or the hiring manager reached out to him on LinkedIn. I think that‚Äôs where the easy part stops. He still had to follow through all the interview steps, online assessment, multiple hours of Leetcode to land a job.|||DM for referral",

I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re.

Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "No. The reforestation campaign in Nepal has been really exemplary. The concept of Community Forests has been modal and it has had a massive impact on the  green coverage. The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation.

Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it.

Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest.

But to be in the situation is already a failure. We already failed when there was a situation to choose between life and property. The situation shouldn't have arisen at the first place. And the army doesn't have all the blame to take. Lord knows what security council was busy in. What purpose does a security council serve if it cannot hold a meeting in emergency. Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own. If army was mobilised timely, airport would probably not be the only safe place.|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Best took the best decision in that day, every step taken was well done !|||Khoi k vanne eti dherai question haru xan.

And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.

And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Most of all, register and VOTE.|||No, we should be thankful that we have overcome the first step of political crisis. Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||My husband moved from one FAANG to the other one and both times either the recruiter or the hiring manager reached out to him on LinkedIn. I think that‚Äôs where the easy part stops. He still had to follow through all the interview steps, online assessment, multiple hours of Leetcode to land a job.|||DM for referral",

He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > ‚ÄúScam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

I see lots of Indian software devs (3 to 5+ work experience ) following the similar route. I just wanted to know if there are Nepalese software devs who also did the same.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I‚Äôm not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US. Cold emails and reach would be the way to go 4. Research countries where Big Tech will sponsor software engineers and bring them there. There‚Äôs big tech hubs in Poland, Amsterdam, Singapore and more. Research if the tech companies there also sponsor talent from abroad.|||I know a bunch who came directly from Nepal.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it‚Äôs not.

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

How many injustices do females have to suffer in the name of culture, tradition and religion- it never crosses anybody's mind.|||Ask ex-Kumaris if it felt or was cruel.

Are you saying you love someone else‚Äôs kid than their own parents?|||Do the parents not have any say in this?|||This is sick|||I feel like more people should be aware (not trying to disrespect the culture)|||OP, you‚Äôve raised a really important point. To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture.

But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control. Let's ask ourselves, who benefits the most from this control? Who was suffering from not having control?   Media? Politicians? Oligarchs?   To everyone wondering about the extent of the control.

But the criticism is more of a constructive one to keep him in check. But these jholeys with all sorts of anonymous names claiming to be dharanis have similar patterns. They are completely dismissive of sampang. So it's not difficult to know that they are politically motivated. And about shram daan, if this jhole knows anything about how Singapore and china built their nation initially he wouldn't be talking about all this crap.|||Yo political kura gare jasto lagyo,gareko sabai kuralai normalize garne,tmi dharan kai bhaye pani kewal shramdaan lai maatra nahera ta tyo baheka aru pani gareka xan.kehi garekai xaina jasto banaune prayas ho ra?|||Sabai le afno afno area ma sudhar gare vai halyo.

Don‚Äôt get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that‚Äôs why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one‚Äôs own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today‚Äôs world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re.

Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career.

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity.

Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea.

If we asked 100 ex-Kumaris about their experiences and whether they felt exploited or saw it as a privilege, I‚Äôm confident most would say they didn‚Äôt feel abused, contrary to what many internet activists claim.  To better understand the reality, I‚Äôll share links to interviews and articles featuring former Royal Kumaris, published by BBC and ABC.  Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn‚Äôt right, but those conditions don‚Äôt exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life. (as per 2019 article)  So, don‚Äôt let disconnected keyboard warriors, who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots, misrepresent our beautiful tradition as a story of abuse or exploitation.

The respect and reverence given to the Kumari is not only religious but also a reflection of Nepal‚Äôs rich history and traditions. These people just find way to get away from traditions. Even the kings would receive her blessings before important events, military campaigns, or other significant state matters. The divine grace of the Kumari was thought to ensure his prosperity and the kingdom‚Äôs peace and stability.|||Yep, I've talked to an exKumari myself and she said she felt honored about being chosen. Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists. In the past there were some issues about schooling and prejudice against marrying exKumari but there have been lots of reforms and cultural mindset changes now, led by exKumaris themselves. If you don't believe in Kumari or are an atheist, noone is forcing you to visit her or seek blessing.

We can question some of these rules, but not without understanding the context and significance behind it.

The facts, based on local Nepali voices and government policies, paint a very different, much more nuanced picture that overwhelmingly supports the continuation of this vital cultural practice, proving it is not exploitative in nature.    The Reality of the Living Goddess: A Cultural Privilege üá≥üáµ  Not Isolated, But Tutored and Connected: The claim of \"isolation from family\" is a common critique. In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it‚Äôs either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

Peacefully.|||when someone grows up fully immersed in a tradition, they often won‚Äôt criticize it because it‚Äôs tied to their identity and sense of pride. That doesn‚Äôt make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn‚Äôt mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||This was much needed! Thank you!|||BS, this pratha is blatant child abuse no matter what you try to mask it with. An old dude inspecting every body part for selection, them being isolated from their childhood, gaining awkward social skills and hampering overall development after it is all over, etc. Just grotesque acts committed in the name of culture. The ex-kumaris are brainwashed so ofc they will only talk good things about it.|||The idea that Kumari directly conflicts and contradicts the UNHRC and UNESCO is fascinating.

These practises are unique to Nepal and it has to be preserved no matter what. With changing times; we must make changes that conform with modern values.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples. If one has core understanding of the subject and knows how to manage time with good handwriting, it isnt difficult to score 70+. You will need to be consistent though.|||Maile ni 2 barsa almost every exam ma 85 katako ho tei pani 2L jati ta tirnai paryo so its kinda hard tara ali mehenat garyo bhane chai sakchau easily 85% just math lastai dami banaunu paryo ani aru ma decent bhayepani katcha|||Hello u/Technical_Cat6948, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Honestly, drop year mero lagi chahi sajilo thiyena ... There were days I literally did nothing and felt super guilty about it .

It's not due to lack of knowledge from his side that makes it hard for us to grab the concepts, it's just the fact that he's shit at teaching and doesn't care about whether or not everyone understands. Regardless, I'm studying CS and want a good base in maths for the future. Mero first term aaudai cha, I tried to go through a few YouTube channels, some of them are alright but I already struggle with maths & physics so it's pretty difficult to understand *everything* I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest any channels (or alternative platforms) which are good.

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
