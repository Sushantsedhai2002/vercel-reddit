For Dudh Kunda, you go the same path but from the river, you go north, a 4x4 would take you to the last village.

The reason is Nepali stores buys from abroad likely UAE or India and sells here. Thats when the warranty period starts not when u buy unless you bought from authorized seller.   But according to LAW, if any mishaps happens to ur device except physical dmg, it should cover till warranty period.

No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run.

She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

People blasting loud music on speakers as if the whole mountain came to hear their playlist. It’s not a concert. It’s a hiking trail. Nature already has music — the birds, the wind, the  trees. But no, someone always has to play *“Suniya Suniya rataan”* at full volume.     It’s not just about music. It’s about respect , for others, for nature, and for the space we share.     Other things that Nepalis do which shows our civic sense level:  * They don’t know the priority rule — the person coming uphill has the right of way, because it’s harder for them to stop and restart. But what happens? People coming downhill walk in groups, blocking the whole path, forcing the tired climber to step aside. * They throw plastic wrappers, bottles, and cigarette butts everywhere — as if the forest will clean up after them. * They shout and laugh loudly in quiet places, disturbing everyone trying to enjoy the peace. * They leave their waste after a picnic, thinking “someone will clean it later. * They bring alcohol to hikes, get drunk, and make a mess. * They graffiti rocks and temple walls with “\"khatey\" was here” — as if the world needed proof. * Blocking narrow trails by walking side-by-side in groups * Urinating near water sources or on the trail  One thing people need to understand is the mountains do not owe us anything. They are not there for our enjoyment. Humans have this tendency that everything on earth is for their consumption. So, be grateful that you are able to be in the nature.",

He was sharing evidences in his videos on how people from the current cabinet are Barbara foundation and other INGOs linked.  - During that protest, Balen indirectly assumed a leadership role, issuing directions to protesters through his Facebook posts. He even indirectly warned Prasai not to join after the protesters went to meet him. Balen later backtracked and wanted nothing to do with the protest.   - the current government incorporates people who had previously helped revoke the license of his medical college, leaving his arbau worth of investment stranded.   - Current government lai GenZ protest massacre ko pressure dine kaam ta Balen ra GenZ leaders haru le dinu parne ho.

It’s the easiest way to control the masses, unite them under a flag, create an enemy, and suddenly the crowd that once questioned authority now marches in obedience. It teaches us to take pride in accidents of birth, to draw lines between us and them. It glorifies separation, disguising division as honor, and convinces us that serving a flag is nobler than serving humanity. In truth, nationalism doesn’t unite, it isolates. It feeds collective ego, fuels wars, and keeps people blinded to the simple fact that we were all human of this planet long before we were citizens. how absurd it is that people kill each other over flags that can’t feel, and borders that can’t bleed. Every soldier on every side thinks they are defending their home, not knowing both are victims of the same illusion.",

Can we be friends?|||When countries transformed from feudal \"chosen by god\" king structure of society organization to modern nation states, people needed something to identify with, if it's not god that says you two are same, then what? This is why nationalism as an ideology was created. I think it started during the french revolution.   It's pretty useful sometimes, take for example liberation struggles of India and China from colonialists, but just like religion, it can divide people like in Yugoslavia. In my opinion it's just evolution of religion for modern times with nation states instead of \"divine\" monarch, it's useful in organization of nation states in present society where one nation state wants to fuck over the other nation state.  Maybe one day, nation states will no longer exist as they exist today and nationalism will be just as useless as religion is today, but it's pretty difficult to imagine tbh. Just like how in transformation of nobility to normal citizens, nation states might have to stop doing imperialism for true internationalism as an ideology to come froth, but I don't see that happening in this century.|||Then culture or any kind of united group does it as well. It is better it look at it like these division unites people than divides. Ani there are many divisions other than nationality as well... like religion.

            "body": "Lately I’ve been noticing something a lot, these big buses, trucks, and even small micros are throwing out crazy amounts of black smoke. We always see news about “pollution checks” and “government monitoring,” but honestly… it doesn’t look like anything is working.  Just walk on the main roads and look around, the smoke is everywhere. I go for a walk in the morning and even at 6 AM the roads are full of black fumes because these vehicles have already started their smoke show.  I’m from Kathmandu, so I see it every day. Maybe it’s the same in other cities too. This is why I feel EV should be promoted especially when it comes to public vehicles. I’m not saying EV is the only solution, even these diesel buses would be fine if they were maintained properly. But you know how it works here: neither the public nor the government cares enough.  There are thousands of people with lung and heart issues already, and this is making life worse for everyone, especially now in winter.  So yeah, just wanted to rant. We all deal with this every day, and I honestly don’t even know who’s supposed to monitor this. Pollution and public vehicle management are never a priority for our government, no matter who’s in charge.",

With the incompetency of Nepal police, APF, Home ministry, defence ministry that we have, it could have gone way south. The police doesn't even have enough conscience let alone training and equipment. The system is hollow from within, rotten by corruption over the years. They have no clue what mob management is, and they have sense of revenge on the protestors. The intellegence agency has only become the easiest way to appoint corrupt people and we expect it to work. Corruption has left no room for expenses on the right equipment and training. Nepal police has always been critised for having lethal rifle rounds like INSAS and SLR and APF has existential crisis.   All governments responsible for corruption in making a hollow system shall face consequence. We cannot even ensure now that such a massacre isn't going to occur again. This isn't just one day fault, this is years of corruption, incompetence and lack of conscience in action. And everyone responsible needs to face consequence.|||Is this news of recent?|||I won't put all the blame on police only, some protestors (genz and others) wanted destruction of those public properties.

And for, writing section. I think there are three section. 7,8 and 10 marks question . For 7 and 8 marks writing write 150-200 words with right content. If the content is good you will get marks And for 10 marks 250-300 is recommended. But this doesnot imply everywhere. Its totally up to teachers how they veiw . Some prefer good writing and content while others just give marks based on how long you write. I would suggest you to mix both. Focus on good writing skills and also consider the  ideal word range...|||Not answering the question directly writing off-topic. Ignoring part of the question e.g., explaining causes but forgetting solutions. Unclear position, not showing your opinion when required. Rewriting the question instead of giving your own ideas. Weak support ideas without explanation or examples. Coherence and Cohesion Poor paragraphing  no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Overusing connectors like “Firstly, Secondly” without logic. Limited variety of linking words  repeating “However” or “Moreover.” Abrupt transitions  jumping between ideas with no smooth link.

There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "subreddit": "Nepal",
            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

It’s stuck between two superpowers, India and China, thus its politics will never be free from their influence. It's very diverse with deep rooted caste/ethnicity issues which makes it harder to unite the country toward a common cause. On top of that, Nepali people are sorta low IQ on average (as are other South Asians) so they can't make up for it in human capital|||nepal needs leaders like Putin, Xi or any other strong leadership. useless democratic leader!|||Nepal ko real problem nepali haru lai nai thaha xaina.

What about taking advantage of your own resources? What about planning your economy in order to take advantage of global supply chains?   We never did that because our system is one that benefits other countries like India and the USA and China. We won't develop because developing would mean we need to care about our own interests and distance ourselves from other countries.   Neo-liberal capitalism won't bring us forward, only socialism will. The only hope a small nation like ours has to develop is if ALL resources our country has (hydro, minerals, tourism) is exploited FULLY for OUR benefits. Only then will we actually develop. We need to fully control private businesses centrally, develop 5 year plans like China to take advantage of the global trade market and allow foreign companies to manufacture inside of Nepal.   Once they start production, we learn how to produce our own products by looking at how they produce and then we can upgrade from a resource exporting country to a manufacturing economy.   This won't take \"hard work\" but a restructure of our system to benefit national interests|||English chai testo ramro raina cha|||ok but who asked?",

It's free for life, will just cost you higher upfront (mine cost 8k). I recharged Rs.500 and it ran for 2 years. For advanced features(that require internet or calls), you will need to recharge often, maybe like 1500/year. But for basic tracking, Rs.500 will basically run the GPS until your validity expires, I think. You could even recharge lower - just upto the point where you maximize your validity.

Its kinda competitive as many students reach out as per I know 800 students applied last year Here are some of the things you should understand to increase your chances .  Dont reach out to other developers or anyone who isnt directly in the hiring process. One of the main thing in that post Internship ma referral ko kam nai xaina and thats to the point. Paxi bujdai jada taha vayo ki as they dont get any bonus referral internship ma so they dont have to do so.  CV ma use numbers instead of full form of text ,no photos hobbies or GPA.

Always and remember always apply through Company website. Linkedin just visibility pauna use garxan derai jaso company le this included. Many dont even check those pages so always apply through companies websites and portal. Because it shows that you are actually interested and aren't mass applying. So first hunai parxa.

Malai taw interview onsite hunxa ki vanera tension parethyo as mero clz rw tyo office alli tada xa but then got to know that interview was done through google meet.  And I joined the call Hr was on time (well already a green flag for me ) and then another senior was also on the call.  After basic convo the senior dai asked me uestion about my project. Interesting was I didnt do project on React but they didnt care becayse they say that for joining that internship you need to have drive than just knowldege of 100+ languages.  And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.

Interested jati plus who show initiative they plan to take those.  Dar laerathyo because I thought its was a perfect fit for me. And now sigh of relief I just got an email that I was selected.  Well I am sure yaa aru pani tannai talented manxe haru xan so dont think you wont get internship mero ni kunai katrai teyena and do apply who knows maybe you are my next colleuge whom I would work with.",

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||nepal k*anda in big 2025? f no.|||this sub is being used to train horniest nepali ai|||Don’t go to those sites or stop watching these kind of shit bro.

What changed is a new court interpretation that looks more at who paid for what and whose name the property’s under.

Basically, it’s about clearer proof, not banning claims. Stop oversimplifying laws and for once, read past the headline before running with it.   And btw, alimony is a gender-neutral term it’s not solely “for women.” The reason most recipients are women is because many are still financially tied to their husbands.

I've seen these happen with my own eyes to married dudes who were really good person, loved their wife to their core and in return all they got was betrayal, I'm not saying good women do not exists, they do, but the problem is every women thinks she's a good person when most aren't.   I know good women exists, is it worth to gamble everything you've achieved from hard work for a women that is almost certain to betray you?

But you need to realize where the law comes from. It doesn't seem fair that women are left without anything from their maita and their (new) ghar if they end up with nothing in case of divorce. I know they have a claim to paternal property (maita ko) but how many do you see actually getting it? In most cases, they're entitled to the half because of their contribution with the overwhelming share of homemaking role they play. Of course, the law needs updating, but you can't really do away with the provision.   2. Where are you pulling the stats from, your ass? Almost everyone has their past traumas, unhealthy attachments, mental issues and whatnot. So you're saying men are perfectly healthy and only women come in a marriage with mental and emotional baggage? That's willfully naive.  3.

Cruelty or violence , Desertion for 3+ years, Adultery , Mutual consent. So a wife or husband cannot just wake up one morning and file for divorce and take your property.  Nepal does not legally recognize prenup agreements . The money you earn before the marriage is all yours but the money you earn after is divided equally. There is a rule 'Property you made before marriage or inheritance you receive will remain personal property of that individual' in section 99 or 100 of muluki ain.  Alimony is based on financial condition not on gender. Both can ask for alimony if they are in bad financial condition. The courts also checks income, property before giving it. This is so that the other person does have basic necessities like food, home and clothes.  The law does not protect cheating women. It is a valid legal ground for divorce and the cheating partner legal standing is property claim is very low.    All the other thing you said Its what you think and is also not true.

Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone. But I am ok now. Ek barsa drop liye and gave entrance exams again, BHOLI results aaudai chha and I feel positive about the results.  I honestly believe 11 ko results le kei matter gardaina. Ramrari padeu bhane mazza le ramro gpa lyauna sakinchha. Here's a quick tip for you...  1.Sab teacher ko chhutai chuttai notes banau and make sure to store them safetly.  2. Class ma lekhako sab fata fat chhapa, kei chutyo bhane leave some space tara chhapna chhodne hoina.  3. Don't wait for the teacher. PW ko lectures herera teacher le chapter suru garna aagadi nai timi finish gardeu (PW ko notes pani ramrari banau )   4. Napadhne keta haru sanga aali kam sangat rakha, also if you're talking to a girl ( romantically) make sure it doesn't take a lot of your time and energy.   And believe in yourself.|||Its pretty decent bro you'll slay jn boards chill|||Bro, I got less than that in my high school and I'm slaying more than my toppers. So fk gpa. You've to have trust in yourselves.|||Okay i got 3.9 see ma ani 1st term ma failed 4 subs never passed terminal exams sidhai boards ma pass bhako.|||My perspective with having +2 15 years behind me: It may somewhat limit your immediate chances but if you have the basics, work ethic and determination in you, it doesn't matter much. I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail. I being a metro scholar failed real bad my terminals. It shook all the confidence within me, had me go through lots of bad mouthing from my own parents. So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track. You can put in half the efforts but improve further than me, don't be sad your marks degraded rather try improvising new study methods to help you improve.|||You do realize that there are ppl who will absolutely kill for your current grade right?|||Bro mero ni SEE ma 3.9 aako thiyo ani 11 ko first term ma 2.9 muskil le (I was from sci background) pachi 12 ma balla talla push garera 3.65 lyauna safal bhaye",

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

One of the best time to be in Janakpur. Glad you enjoyed your visit and nice clicks.|||Though it is true that the janakpur city is quite polluted and unmanaged but the vibe visiting there is next level due to the historical and cultural values it carries with the presence of almighty temples, ponds, mithila culture and arts. And the chhath celebration is somehow greatest there with lots of people visiting. Try exploring other places of Nepal too. Have a good visit.|||[deleted]|||Glad you enjoyed it, feel free to come again and explore the rest of the country.|||Janakpur is Magnificent area|||thanks management for removing the disco lights from Janaki temple|||Nice  I would recommend the northern part|||Everything goes on in Janakpur as it goes on every other city but there is something, that feeling of inner peace. Feels good man.|||Try going to Halesi, Khotang through Siraha. You should see all the pahadis, cool weather, big rivers to religious sites. A good motorcycle ride.|||Thank you for visiting. Not sure about others but I often edit google maps (editing the highway map mostly north south, update phone number for hotels, motorcycle garages) just so that our Indian tourists can visit the pahads and have smooth travel. Atithi Devo Bhava|||Janakpur has huge potential like pashupatinath. But corruption eaten the whole province.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu. And didn't you visit Patan durbar square? If you love mountains then visit Muktinath temple in Mustang.||| Travel Package link?|||Chitwan lumbini Nagarkot Panauti all the 4 durbar squares are good too|||Wow! Look at those towering mountains. So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.  This should not be about man vs women if we are  in a relatively good society than Nepal but we are not in a equal society.  (Also if you think inequality does not exist just because you didn't experience it, then you are part of the inequality equation)  Nepali society ma misogyny dherai Cha which will lead to misandry someday.  Mysogny should be reduced for the sake of equality, not for the sake of preventing misandry.  (Also attractiveness and wealth  plays a good amount of role in the dating circle of Nepal to the point where a lot of insane shortcomings become ignored)|||introvert me  ![gif](giphy|COYGe9rZvfiaQ)|||I don't agree that most men will find it hard to find a partner|||[deleted]|||Generalization tbh. Not completely wrong, not completely right either.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.

Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I didn’t do anything special; it was plain and okay. I never craved or wished for anything. Sometimes, not having anyone’s attention and living a lonely life makes things easier.

Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out. Thr lady couldnhave just asked her senior and would have know the reason but instead decided that she isn’t there to serve but to rule. The problem ia that these people aren’t deceplined for their actions and continue to melign the name of their own country.|||As an Indian, I'm very sorry that Nepalis have to go through this in India. I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating. I really want those officials punished for misusing their authority and especially because their actions have cost someone an important career opportunity.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge! Maybe the reason is recent protest and many criminals were out of jail. But The hotel manager knew that they weren't bad people, but didn't allow them. Thank god there was a Non-government hotel nearby and they stayed there.|||Well, we had faced similar incident from India, while traveling to Romania.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense. Idiots.|||Ok but why the lips chuppa to a student?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

Area=1/2\\*base\\*height(Height and the base are same for both triangles)|||I MISS CLASS 10 HUHU|||Triangle AQD ra triangle BQD ko same area, same base and same height because under same parallel lines, haina ABA both Bata Triangle PQD subtract gara, then result ayo  Bujyau?|||here,  triangle abq= triangle abd ( triangles standing on the same base AB betwenn same parallel lines DC )   ABD-APB=AQB-APB ( subtracting common side )   APD=BPQ    short and simple|||I miss you  edit: Talking to the math, not to you OP|||Is that opt math?|||Yes, their areas are equal. Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them. Thus remaining halves i.e sodheko duita triangles should have same area 🔥😉",

And the stress/aspiration for future is tense, scary  and exciting.   Even though this journey is merely for 2 years, but the impact and experiences that it gave us is worth appreciating.

Everything is so rapid and it's hard to grasp everything.      The bitter part for me is teachers and even classmates to some extent are strangers. I love how in school everyone knew and had different connection with every other teacher but here they just yap and go. The bond with classmates isn't great yet but I hope I will make some lifelong buddies out there.  The course is kinda hard as well and the competition is crazy asf. Einsteins here and there. Never failed an exam but for the first time in my life I think I am gonna be just-pass in Physics, man I hope I won't fail.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.

From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.

If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

You are getting that job because someone qualified in US is not getting 3x the salary you make.|||That is a good amount of money 🤑|||Bro. You know you can earn a lot more, right? Nepal mai basera pani you can earn way more than $2800 with the skills and certs you have|||For role 👏|||Eyebrows raised, yes luxury has no limits if you earn more than you can spend in one month!!! I'm here for last 15years and If 40K NPR is the expenses for yourself only then ok you are living modest luxury but you say you live with your family then if you are the one earning and supporting all family expenses then I don't believe NPR 40k is making you live comfortably with families of 4 if you are renting a 2bhk flat for living. My experience in Kathmandu is, it's not the cheapest metropolis to live where 30% of your  salary goes to paying rent and rest to grocery, health,  education and EMI if you are earning around 100K NPR per month living with a 3,4 person family.|||What's yrs education qualification?

One of the best time to be in Janakpur. Glad you enjoyed your visit and nice clicks.|||Though it is true that the janakpur city is quite polluted and unmanaged but the vibe visiting there is next level due to the historical and cultural values it carries with the presence of almighty temples, ponds, mithila culture and arts.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

The guy *never* talks about KP Oli, UML’s corruption, or even the brutal killing of protesting students. Not a single strong word.

Like, where was all this energy when students were being beaten or when Oli was selling out the country’s interests?  It’s like he selectively targets whoever’s in power now, just to look “anti-establishment,” while conveniently staying silent about the past. If he really cared about truth and justice, he’d call out *all* sides — not just pick easy targets for clout.

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.

Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

            "comments": "SA at FAANG. First, hiring is very tight across the board. I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||[removed]|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else 🙌🏽|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing? Unlike Indians?   We are not competitive enough? OR We are not Intrested enough?|||2x summer intern in faang. Oh ur location is india.|||If you are talking about direct recruiting from Nepal,  I don't know so far, but one of my friend and senior from Nepal working at VISA with the level of pay that FAANG and all does. But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||Tier1 college in India and now at Microsoft, best entrypoint is a good college in India and there are so many schemes like DASA, SII, ICCR, Compex to help you get in.

Sell yourself to others.|||My husband moved from one FAANG to the other one and both times either the recruiter or the hiring manager reached out to him on LinkedIn.

I earn in lakhs even with just a few years of experience, which I’m grateful for, but I can’t help wondering how long this will last.  Sure, I could aim for higher-paying roles or even start my own company, but honestly, that feels too risky right now. The market doesn’t seem very promising, and the uncertainty makes it hard to plan for the future.  At the same time, I know this routine: waking up early, going to work every day, coming home late, getting two days off won’t stay exciting forever. Sometimes I feel like I’m just running on autopilot.  Part of me envies people with government jobs. The pay might be lower, but there’s stability, no pressure to constantly learn new tech, and no fear of layoffs. Just a simple, secure, and peaceful life.  Does anyone else feel the same way? How do you deal with the uncertainty of IT jobs here?",

Currently, I'm in my 7th sem & working as junior backend dev and have worked on multiple projects. And I believe I'm fairly versed enough in my tech stack to contribute to open source in any impactful manner.   My tech stack is primarily Django but I can work on frontend with React as well.   I've already setup previous year GSOC ma participate gareko organization ko project that uses what I'm versed on. Each day after college and work I will dedicate 2 hrs to open source work. Hope it pays dividends down the future.   Wish me luck.",

But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.

So you can imagine the shallow interaction between the sexes. As a result many guys dont have a clue on how to talk to women, dunno if its true for the other side.

It's not just a male flaw the problem runs deeper it's deep rooted in our culture and society. Maybe we're a flawed society. So let's create a better society where men aren't like this? But this doesn't mean we should use society as an excuse to avoid personal accountability. Every man is still responsible for unlearning harmful behavior and trying to be a better person. But we also can’t ignore why so many men think and act this way in the first place.|||Don't worry homies, it ain't just you.

Also, I can also see increase in bad marriages especially in lower/middle class. Why? Weak financial backgrounds being from lower/middle, and more lovestruck fools getting into marriage.|||Yea Arrange marriage is shit. You will get trap for unnecessary drama both for men as well as women and never ending fight. Better is to not marry than marry someone whom you don't like.|||There are more men than women. Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.      Nepal and India(depending upon urbanization)   Arranged marriage divorce rate: <5%  Love marriage divorce rate: 35-50%|||You can't blame just men on this.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense. Idiots.|||Ok but why the lips chuppa to a student?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

She wakes up prepare breakfast, then prepare/arrange everything for lunch, come back home from work and is greeted with dirty dishes in the sink, then she makes dinner. Amma cannot do much but mama on the other hand doesn't even bother to wash few dishes how the fuck is this fair. I mentioned the earning part cause some of you might think they are the PROVIDERS or whatever. She has exam tomorrow and hasn't even got one hour to herself to study. When will this stop? Why there is no equal contribution when its both of their house. All my mama are same. I am soo mad. I am here doing dishes and cooking thinking it will ease her off even if its for few days.",

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted. TLDR: rpeating years, doesn't equal to same amount of preparations every year. Some years are good, some are not. I believe, luck too needs to favor one, we just like to call it, God helps those who help themselves.|||competition tough xa ni limited seats with unlimited sitters|||shi u seem immature",

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them.

The bond with classmates isn't great yet but I hope I will make some lifelong buddies out there.  The course is kinda hard as well and the competition is crazy asf. Einsteins here and there.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I thought I’d go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that… but now, I don’t even feel like staying in science. Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me — social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Social ma map pani basic haru aaucha mostly. Time management is very important. Don't rote learn, understand the concept and you're chill.  Also don't fear about it like I did. During the few days of leave just before SEE, I was having borderline anxiety regarding what to study, where to start and all. Please don't be like me. Be chill about it. Everyone, specially teachers, exaggerate about importance of SEE.  Also not trying to discourage but please don't think that high GPA will get you anywhere after 10, i was in the same delusion as well. only that it will help you is flex it for 2 weeks and after that no one's gonna remember even if you got 4. Scholarship is given on the basis of entrance marks and rarely the GPA, so study in such a way that will benefit later on.|||Ramrari padhnu babu.|||SEE ta chill ho, unless lalitpur municipality ko kunai school ma padhi raaxau, 3.6 kataaye hunxa.

It's just that the questions will mostly be the type which includes the most things from the chapter. Maths just get through everything it's not that hard at all. English and nepali just practice and manage time (or watch some english shows). They give pretty good number in social just remember important points.
