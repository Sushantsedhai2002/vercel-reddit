If your pecker can't hit the g-spot, then youre small. The typical lenth for g-spot to be from the opening of vagina is around 3 inches. And also \" it is not the size of the boat but the movement of the ocean\", means sex is an art. You dont need to get insecure, but you can measure the size of your pecker ofc.

Maybe it was because, like you mentioned, she was abusive and you were emotionally neglected by her?|||Pls seek professional help/therapist to process your emotions.

I couldn't accept the reality and my mind diverted from truth and created a lie inside my head that my mom will be home waiting for me when i get back. This denial went for months and finally when i realized i can't lie to myself forever a sense of sadness came over me. That day i cried a lot. Since then 15 years have passed and i still think why i didn't react on the spot.

This year, I went on two dates that, at the start, felt genuinely promising. The first one was incredible. We spent hours texting, talking on the phone, and building a real connection before even meeting in person. When we did, the chemistry between us was undeniable and we went to his house, there was kissing, cuddling, and a seg that felt natural ( I could feel we were really into each other). We even made plans to meet again, with all the excitement of what could come next. But the moment I walked away from him, everything just... stopped. No messages. No replies. Nothing. It’s crushing, especially when everything felt so connected in the moment. The least I could’ve hoped for was a bit of courtesy of just a simple message or an explanation before being left in the dark…or just say something. Silence do really kills inside  Then, there was the second date. It felt like it was going somewhere, too. We spent months of communicating that included  long conversations, thoughtful texts, walks, lunch dates, coffee meet ups, it felt real. And yet, out of the blue, without warning, I received a single message: ‘Sorry, we shouldn’t talk anymore.’ That was it. No explanation, no closure, just an abrupt end. It left me shattered, questioning everything..since my first date, I wasn’t healed completely…  After the both of these experiences, I’ve been left with so many unanswered questions, questioning myself; Did I do something wrong? Was I not interesting enough? Attractive enough? I find myself checking my phone frequently hoping for some kind of message, some sign that maybe I misunderstood the situation. But deep down I try to console myself saying  it’s not about me. It’s about how some people treat others without care, without consideration, without respect for the connection that was shared. It’s just hard not to internalize the silence, even though I know better. Tera it doesn’t help to he honest  P.S All three of us are not out.",

I have only liked one girl and would move mountains for her but I’m 99% straight. We knew there is no future for us so we decided to be friends. For her, I even gave my sexuality a label.

            "body": "Me and my husband (29) are living in a rented house where we had a contract for 2 years but we’re moving out after barely 3 months of living here. We had to get the whole neighborhood and the ward involved. The landlords tried to change the terms of the contract on 7th September right before the protests and right before Dashain Tihar when we wouldn’t have found a new place on short notice. They gave us the option to either sign the new contract or end the tenancy. The change made was that they fired baini who had been taking care of their garden, because they wanted their own brother to live inside the premises where she’d been staying, while we’re paying full rent. The brother is almost 40 years old, and if we had any conflict with him we wouldn’t even be able to tell the landlords because he’s their own family. They gave us the option of either having him stay with us, or us staying by ourselves but taking care of their garden ourselves, or terminating the contract. We were forced to sign with the option of staying by ourselves, and then they started bringing up issue after issue about the garden so they could get their brother in. They also started spreading baseless rumours in the neighborhood about us doing “illegal activities” in the house. Mind you we’d been paying rent on the first of the month every month, AND they have our security deposit of one month rent. Idk why they wouldn’t just tell us they need the whole house for their brother and give us time to find a new place to move out. Why did he have to stay with us? After we didn’t budge about letting him in, they sent him to intimidate us to move within 5 days. He came twice in one day and the second time even said he’d jump the gate and come in if we didn’t let him. That’s when we went to the ward and they set up a meeting for both parties a couple days later. On the day of the meeting, the landlady came in with her “ward friends” who weren’t actually from the ward, and thank god we had the tole bikas adhachya come in to supervise the situation so they couldn’t start harassing us again. We reached a sahamati about when we’re moving out and how much of our deposit we’d get back. Now, even after everything is sorted, the landlady is coming in again tomorrow to harass us even further regarding the electricity bill. Mind you this place has no doorbell and their electricity meter is inside the house in their storeroom, so we’re also having to pay the late payment fine on electricity after baini left because we can’t hear when the meter guy is here, and the landlords don’t even have his number for us to call. We’re moving out in a week now and have also already said we’ll pay the electricity bill, but they still won’t leave us alone until the day we move out. We don’t even know what to make of this situation. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with her tomorrow?   Oh and also they haven’t even given baini her +2 certificate back after they fired her.    (TL;DR : Landlord harassing us and spreading baseless rumours about us in the neighborhood even though we’ve paid full rent on time and are moving out in a week. They’re coming again tomorrow to shout more about what they’re not content with, any advice on how to deal with people like this?)",

            "body": "TLDR: A Nepali student at Ole Miss asked JD Vance why legal immigration is being cut after leaders promoted the American dream to those who followed the rules. The exchange was calm factual and brave.  Video:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8)  At the University of Mississippi a Nepali calmly and clearly questioned JD Vance during a Turning Point event. She asked why leaders who once promoted the American dream to legal immigrants now argue to shrink legal pathways and say we do not belong. Her poise facts and courage were inspiring.  For many of us this moment feels personal. Legal immigrants study work pay taxes and strengthen communities. When people in power target legal pathways it is fair and necessary to speak up with respect and clarity.  Gen Z in Nepal recently showed remarkable civic courage during protests against corruption. That same spirit peaceful principled and focused on justice belongs in every place. From Kathmandu to a college campus in Mississippi we Nepalis should raise our voices against injustice misinformation and the scapegoating of immigrants.  This moment matters because it centers fairness and the promises made to those who followed the rules. It highlights how rhetoric at political events touches real lives of people waiting in long lines for visas and green cards. It also connects to a wider wave of youth led civic action that insists on dignity and accountability.  Note:   She is Nepali, but most Indian media are portraying her as Indian. Did not expect anything less. 😅",

Nobody from US came to me and asked me to come here, I did it because of that image I had of the US.   Other than that she was amazingly calm and quite reasonable in her questions.  Vance was refreshingly good in his answer, but he always has been good with words.|||Didn’t know she was a Nepali. I didn’t like some of the questions but otherwise she was very thoughtful and calm about it. Kudos.|||I am not a JD vance fan, nor I am right wing, but everything he has said here is valid. Just because we don’t like someone or don’t agree with something they say, they cant be wrong at all times.  The immigration is an issue in the US and is in all over the world. The system is talking about putting proper immigration law in place which is valid. It is not saying that we will give you student visa but won’t let you study. It may be saying that if you come as a Student, you shall remain a student and have to return after you complete your education. Now, this may not be ideal for an individual, but this cant be called, “You are selling us a dream and taking It away”.|||People hate me for this thing. But the us embassy in Nepal is just a embassy it's a whole f**ucking country that operates politically in Nepal. I was down voted by so called reddit heros.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

It is imperative that the government takes immediate and committed action to secure businesses across Nepal. This protection is a non-negotiable right for all entrepreneurs and businesses, and it must be guaranteed either through the deployment of police forces or a clear, steadfast commitment to protect private property. Businesses and industries form the economic backbone of our country, and they must be shielded from mobs engaging in destruction purely for self-proclaimed satisfaction. Failing to guarantee the security of businesses and industries will inevitably deter both local and foreign investors. Such an environment of fear and uncertainty is profoundly detrimental to the long-term prosperity of an already economically vulnerable nation like Nepal. Protecting our businesses is synonymous with protecting our future.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

            "body": "I am a Buddhist, and I follow the teachings of the Buddha. But I don’t think many people truly understand what the Buddha actually taught.  At the very core  the center of Buddhism  are the Four Pillars (Four Noble Truths):   ---  (1) Dukkha   meaning suffering. This includes the pain of birth, aging, losing loved ones, heartbreak, stress, desire, and so on. You have to accept them, understand them, and eventually try to become free from them.   (2) Nirodha   meaning the end of suffering. To end suffering in this world, you must let go of desire and attachment.    (3) Tanha   meaning craving or desire. All suffering comes from craving, attachment, and ignorance.   (4) Magga   meaning the path. It is the way to end dukkha. Buddha once lived a life of pure indulgence as a prince, yet he was unhappy. He later lived the life of a monk, starving himself, and was still unhappy. He discovered that neither extreme worked. The real path is the Middle Way  a balance between self indulgence and self denial.   Now, about reincarnation  Buddha believed in rebirth, meaning that if you do good deeds, you may be reborn into a better life (for example, as a human). If you do bad karma, you may be reborn into a lower form, like an insect. But reincarnation wasn’t the main point of Buddhism.   The true purpose was to live through the cycles of rebirths and reincarnation experiencing happiness and sorrow until you reach Moksha   (or Nirvana)  to become enlightened, like the Buddha himself, and end the cycle of rebirth and suffering.    Nirvana is the ultimate goal  to reach the state beyond all suffering and desires, to be one with the universe, free from karma, rebirth, and all attachments.    I don’t know  that’s how I understand it. Regardless, these are the core teachings of the Buddha. Everything else  the statues, mantras, clothing, stupas, flags, and monasteries are rituals and traditions added later by his followers.  They kept adding things over the centuries, and now Buddhism has become what it is today. I’m not sure what it’s turned into  somehow the Buddha has become like a god, and suddenly heaven and hell exist… I don’t know. 😐   So when all the other religions goal is to get I to heaven and be happy for infinitely    Buddhism goal is to die  Literally,it's goal is to have 1 life out of cycle of birth and reincarnation,thus reaching ultimate freedom  (To be in heaven and be happy you have to know suffering  And know what is suffering and pain is thus you are never truly happy  )  Blabla",

Most of the people who took computer in +2 don’t actually know much about it, neither are they interested. They just study for the sake of passing the examinations. You are in the same position as them. Also i do agree that those **long ass codes** might feel overwhelming, but you’re not alone.   Also, Its really absurd to say that you don’t have any interest in Computer science. It is a very vast field of study. You need to explore more. And **yes Computer science is also concerned with law**, you can research about it more.  With the world moving forward towards technology and innovation, you should not choose the opposite, you will always need tech in one way or another. Even better, if you already have a degree in it.|||you better be scared 🥀|||Tait 11 ko computer sci tei 6-10 samma ko mixture ho easy xa agi eeuta le kati easy ho bhanera post halirathyo|||Switch hanei bhaye aile nei hana 1 st term ma.

If it doesn’t feel right, just change the course and study whatever you want. And regarding the programming of class 11 and 12, it’s really not that hard; you can easily understand the whole syllabus in less than three weeks.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

I'm here for last 15years and If 40K NPR is the expenses for yourself only then ok you are living modest luxury but you say you live with your family then if you are the one earning and supporting all family expenses then I don't believe NPR 40k is making you live comfortably with families of 4 if you are renting a 2bhk flat for living. My experience in Kathmandu is, it's not the cheapest metropolis to live where 30% of your  salary goes to paying rent and rest to grocery, health,  education and EMI if you are earning around 100K NPR per month living with a 3,4 person family.|||What's yrs education qualification?

For instance- we are collecting old clothes ( any kind of clothes) that could be used as bedding materials and donate those to different animal shelters. As for \"why don't we directly help the street animals with those clothes\" , even if we manage to keep those as bedding materials or for normal 'wearing' that could backfire our thoughts as random street dogs might get soaked and because of dust and all they might get allergy, sever infection and even death. Instead if we can give those collected clothes to shelters they could use them properly and prevent the death of animal from hypothermia or simply, from cold. If anybody got piled of old clothes, you know what you can do with those!  Any piece of cloth is appreciated .  Thankyou, have a good one!",

To give you some context — I’m 23 years old, and I currently have a net income of around 3 lakhs per month.  Here’s some advice for anyone interested:   1. Start Early  I launched my first small business at 16. It was just a simple Facebook page, but it helped me earn my pocket money.  2. Stay Consistent  My first page didn’t make me a single rupee for almost a year — but I kept going with full passion. Eventually, I started receiving promotional offers. (The page was related to education.)  3. Build LinkedIn Connections  This one’s crucial. Right after finishing my +2 level, I created my LinkedIn profile and started sharing my skills, training experiences, and achievements. One of my LinkedIn connections — from the USA — is now one of my biggest clients.  4. Focus on Skills  Invest your time in learning in-demand skills like IT, FinTech, and Communications. In my case, my two strongest skills are FinTech and Startup Building — and they’ve played a major role in helping me reach this stage.   Lastly, stay grounded. Focus on solving real-world problems with your skills — the money will follow naturally.  Thanks for reading till the end!",

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

Other countries are focusing on development, competition, and making new laws that support startups — especially AI startups. But in Nepal, people are not aware, and they don’t seem interested in these things.  I’ve watched some episodes of Shark Tank Nepal, but honestly, I didn’t see many good startups. Most of them are either copies of other businesses or just fashion and clothing brands — not real tech startups. I don’t understand where our country is heading. People don’t seem to care much about the technology field.  Personally, I love developing software. I’ve created many projects, but almost all of them failed. And when I tell my parents that I want to start my own software company, they just say, “Focus on your studies and get a job.” That mindset really hurts. It feels like people here don’t believe in innovation or taking risks.  Even in my college, when I ask my friends what they want to be in the future, most of them say they don’t know. People are not aware of what’s happening around the world. Other countries are busy building big data centers and AI infrastructure, but in Nepal, there’s no real interest or effort in that direction.",

Being able to build a website or a native app is great but IT is so much more than that. It’s about solving real problems and building something that impacts people.  Here in the U.S., even a simple GPT-based tool can quickly find users but in Nepal, it feels much harder to reach that same momentum.  Let me give you an example: the hospital where I worked as an intern had a big touch screen basically a TV installed in every pediatric  patient room for entertainment purpose. A Swiss company built it. They didn’t invent anything groundbreaking, but they solved a simple, practical problem. They took a regular TV, added an outer touch-sensitive layer, placed it on an aluminum frame, and turned it into a medical-grade interactive display. Each 32-inch unit cost over $4,000 and yet hospitals were happily paying for it because it worked and solved a need.  If you love software development and dream of starting a company, my advice is simple: focus on building something that solves a real problem first. Launch your product, find your audience  and let the company form around that.|||Before creating any software, validate first.   Make a fake product video, and show it to potential buyers.  If people seems interested and you get some sales, then only invest your time building it.|||You cannot look at a country with 1 billion people and expect same infrastructure or policies as Nepal. Nepal ko government is shit, if you ask any Indians they will say the same thing about their government.   There is plently of entreprenuer buzz if you know where to look. Stop asking for external validation and ship stuff. Show; don't ask. Even Bill Gates parents didn't want him to drop out of Harvard, same with Mark Zuckerberg.   I agree there is no venture captial, seed investment, taking risk in startup culture in Nepal but should we really stop ourselves from trying something blaming stuff we cannot control?|||Bhako factories haru bistarai close gardai xan.

The global average literacy rate is 86.3%, while Nepal's is 67.9%, India's is 74.4%, and sub-Saharan Africa's is 64.0%. I believe Nepal, India, and other countries should first strengthen basic education, then develop low-end manufacturing. Using the money raised from low-end manufacturing to cultivate talent is the only way to further develop high-tech. This is the same development path followed by East Asian countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. A country the size of Nepal can achieve significant development by focusing on just one technology tree. For example, Bangladesh has taken on a significant portion of China and Southeast Asia's textile industry, and its GDP growth has surpassed India's. I haven't seen such an industry in Nepal or Pakistan. India has software outsourcing, but it's far from sufficient for a country of its size. To play soccer well, one must first learn to run. If a player's running speed is the second-to-last in their class, and they constantly strive to be the third-to-last, I'm not optimistic about their future.|||Even Shark Tank US doesn't have much Tech/AI entries, not just Nepal. It isn't the show to seek funding for those products.  Shark Tank are for consumer-friendly products with a equity valuation that is set to provide quick returns for the investors.  Tech (especially AI intensive) companies in general quote an equity on a premium based on their \"future growth\". So a lot of R&D investment. It is not something that can be offered by an investor or 2. They seek Venture capital fundings for it.|||So Technology is only about software and IT ?",

Meanwhile it's CEO Jense Haung's despite having 3% ownership  there, his networth is currently 180 Billion usd making him 8th richest person in the world.  ​It's a bizarre reminder that when the base number is this enormous, even a few percentage points translate into incomprehensible wealth. Math is so weird!  The Big Question for the Future:  ​Will Nvidia's record valuation burst if the current AI frenzy or \"bubble\" collapses, similar to past tech booms?  What u tho guys lmk :)   ​",

As for nvidia it is major supplier to every big tech out there, the main customer is b2b for nvidia, virtually every tech companies you name it depends on Nvidia’s GPUs and not to talk about the CUDA ecosystem, that itself is one the best moat out there. If we look into AWS, which takes 1/3 of cloud market rely on Nvidia. (H100 and B200 chips) Amaazon internal chips  Trainium is complement to nvidia chips not sub. So if you see any other tech companies trying to build their in-house chips, they are building it for vertical scaling, additional stack to nvidia chips. So for a company that is literally being the backbone of modern internet, i would say the val is fair|||Nvidia gotta innovate , we should be able to run those big opensource models locally  so that we can solve and automate most of enterprise related problems , yes Nvidia has released spark but it's damn expensive, aaile ko normal PC ko cost ma big models 200B+ parameters vako haru chalauna sakne huna paryo ,tespaxi nvidia will be bigger than ever|||Its a stock market bubble, if everyone rushes to one thing its going to fail|||I am a firm believer that this is a tech bubble. But they are also smart, they know its a bubble too. So they will be milking it till they can. But seeing the situation of the world currently with businessmen being at their strongest power and influence somehow it will be mitigates at expense of scamming normal citizens around the world. Even if the bubble doesnt crash it will be everyone by that i mean every country and its citizens that will be paying for it.   Otherwise AI currentlt is just a glorious autocomplete. Not a single AI company is profitable, its just everyone is being sold the dream that someday it will be. Those that know also remain silent to milk it before it collapses.  While AI wont be like NFT dying down after some time, it still will be at the same state. The most useful things it has done is ironically making AI generated P*rn. Thats why few years ago it was heavily censored while now the company are providing so called \"Spicy mode\".|||Nvidia hitting $5 trillion is incredible, but market sentiment can push things to extremes. It’s not really about guessing when a bubble might burst, it’s about knowing where real growth ends and hype begins. The next few earnings reports will show whether this valuation truly holds up",

I am also not bluffing stuffs, but i am very interested in learning things and just getting out of this web-dev space.   You don't have to worry about how will i learn and contribute.   Short background check (not trying to impress just what i know):  I have pretty much good foundations on things like OS, Networks and most of the projects i've done is in Node, in fact, i've just switched to Go (just to be little bit low haha). Also after being here for around 2/3 years, i am pretty sure that it wouldn't that hard for me to learn a new concept/things on the go.  So, i am just a very interested to work and gain experience, kaai kaam khojda khojda na paayera, unpaid garna khojeko haina, i am just trying to uplift my skills trying on real world scenerio. i hope you understand what i mean to actually say.  what's your take on this? it's only a request, if it's okey we can have a talk on my compatibility on the team.|||⚡️Checkout www.workhubnepal.com for hiring they have free and paid plans.",

Everyone was told not to mix, so families did the matchmaking. Also, Nepal actually has more women than men, so statistically it’s not a supply issue, even without arranged marriages, people will still get married because, well, people are gonna to get married.|||Our society is weird on relationships and all. I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

Read and learn every single day so you can speak, think, and act with confidence. Work on your skills now, cooking, tech, communication, or any trade, something that can earn you money anywhere.  Stop wasting time on people who do not push you forward. Cut distractions, focus on growth, and be mentally tough. Outside Nepal, bills will not wait, rent will not wait, and no one will feel sorry for you. Prepare now, build discipline, confidence, and the ability to stand on your own.

Yeah it is hard but I never got this mentality of “Wake up everyday ready to fight” that i hear from people who have been living abroad for a year or so.  Life is hard and difficult everywhere not just abroad .  “You will be judged by how useful,capable,disciplined you are” “Read and learn everyday” bro chill it’s literally not that dramatic.  Yeah your advice is good but acting like its like a warzone everyday being abroad is crazy.|||I am 14 and this is deep. Chill out.|||Unless you're privileged, and your parents are rich..   Its exactly the same thing..    Atleast abroad, if you work hard, you'll get your worth, and make good money.|||Living abroad for last 11 years, achieved things on the line I need to achieve. But reading this post, I am kind of overwhelmed 😂. Yeh you have to do everything on your own, but this post can simply give you a heart palpitations. Life is one step at a time, home or abroad. Chill out!|||Abroad you have a chance   In Nepal you don’t have a chance unless you know someone in power    So yes go abroad   It’s still better than Nepal because you at least have a chance|||Why is this only directed to boys?

And I'm the tough one\"|||As someone living in abroad, this seems too far fetched. Idk if its just Australia but everywhere i go from Jobs to Uni you are given training from the ground 0. If you are just mindful of what you are taught (which you should if you wanna live in foreign country) and have basic survival skills you will do just fine.|||As an older Canadian brother -  I have housed 3 Nepali guys.   Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ? Should be for all... sometimes I wonder where peoples heads are at thinking that going aborad still makes it a mans world. DA.|||Hunx. Noted|||I think that’s just comes with trying to make an independent living.

Nothing changes,  just the language and the people you hang out with. Ps: same for the girls.|||So basically it's the same as in homecountry. I don't understand why people think life is only hard abroad. Bro you choose you choose to go abroad. So earn your choice and yes survival is hard everywhere.|||Living abroad for 2 years. Life is hard everywhere. But it's not that deep.|||People care about your skills not particularly a technical what I am speaking about. Rather about professional skills.|||Aja marey voli dui din ho raja k ko tanap ho testo  ![gif](giphy|F0A48Q2wFjE7S)|||This is just a recipe for disaster. You don't need to dominate. You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol. Like mental toughness is something one can just learn. It comes with experience, dealing with hardships. It's not something you can just build at home. \"Read and learn every single day\" LOL.   Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that. I see alot of international students in Canada from India, Nepal who just hustle , which is good but you have to take a break. Western countries can make you rich but at the same time could take your mental health away without you realizing it and it costs u in the long run.|||hor|||Communication and confidence are two main players.

Please prioritize on these skills.|||Lil bro is a bit too dramatic and emotional.|||The last paragraph is the right fucking truth.    thanks for a wave of motivation|||If you use your brain, 2 hours of work per day can get you a comfortable life in any country.!!!|||This is one of the most honest takes I’ve seen. People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||Just word hard enough to live happily.  Everything else is nuisance. |||well said ....",

This is the reason why women try wearing the most bizzare outfits, just to keep the attention of their romantic interest, without the realization of how they and the Girl in the Dance bar are wearing the same clothes but in different crowds. No Offense to the Girls from dance bars... they figured out that seducing a man is easy with vulgarity.

They just want to escape for a while, that’s it. There’s no way the treatment they need isn’t possible in Nepal. They just want luxury, so they’re going to Singapore. Nothing else.

Now talking about the passport issue, I’m not sure about Deuba’s case, but I read that Oli has a notice against him saying he can’t even leave the valley without the permission of the authorities. About Deuba’s, I haven’t really seen the news.   Even Oli was saying something like he needs his passport to go abroad for treatment, and that too sounds like he just wants to escape for a while. He’s the same person who proudly said that Nepal’s health sector is amazing and that he trusts Nepali doctors, which is why he even did his kidney transplant here.

Recently, Israel launched another attack on Gaza, claiming that Hamas broke the ceasefire by killing an Israeli soldier. In response, they bombed areas where countless innocent people lost their lives.  Israel has been doing this for a long time — bombing cities, hospitals, and homes — killing thousands of innocent people, including children, all in the name of “wiping out Hamas.” But do you really believe that all the people in those hospitals and cities were Hamas members? No. Most of them were innocent civilians, families, and children.  I’m not supporting Hamas. I’m supporting the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering endlessly. Yes, we lost a brave soul, Bipin Joshi, because of Hamas — and that’s tragic. But at the same time, we must not ignore the pain of the people in Gaza who are losing their loved ones every single day due to Israel’s continuous bombings.  What’s happening is not self-defense — it’s genocide",

Fucking genocidal maniacs|||points to ponder indeed|||People taking Israel’s side are supporting genocide plain and simple. You can have opinions, yes but supporting mass murder and the killing of innocent people is not an opinion it’s moral bankruptcy.  Some people here justify their stance because Bipin was killed, but they ignore the hundred  of Bipins being killed by Israel every single day. Over 90,000 lives have been lost most of them civilians also israel is stopping aid.  No one in their right mind can support Israel’s actions. And if they do, let them it only shows their lack of moral decency and disregard for human rights. Don’t waste your energy arguing with such people they’ve already lost their humanity.  I equally hate israel and hamas.|||Fuck the zionist state of Israel.|||Both are wrong free palestine from hamas|||That's given both parties at war are never in good as they're fighting for self-interest, not general good.  Why Nepali should not support Palestine or Hamas? Most of Palestinians who can make a difference support Hamas. Hamas are the ones who indiscriminately killed citizen of our country in captivity which they could have for sure prevented.|||Chatgpt slop.|||You are right what Israel is doing is wrong but if Hamas does not have power to fight against israel , why did they go and attack? History heryo bhane israel pani completely wrong chhaina ra palestine pani. Israel waripari ko muslim desh le jaile pani Israel lai attack garyo/garchha unprovoked. Its proven from history. If you think from Israel's point of view, they are not wrong. Aafulai kailei bachnai nadine.. kaile hamas le hanne, kaile egypt le , kaile jordan, syria... they do not want israel to be there because it is jewish country.  Mero ghar ma kasaile attack gareko garei garchha unprovoked bhane ra ma sanga power chha bahne maile pani arulai sakaidinthe hola because kati attack garirata ..mero chai pariwar chhaina?  But anyways, jaile pani tei innocent, garib , sojho manchhe haru nai yesto jhagada ko chapeta ma parchhan which is very sad. I pray for innocents of both Israel and Palestine.  PS- Bipin was killed because he was Hindu. Had he been Muslim, they would not have killed him.|||Free plastic chicken from hummus.|||Wow awesome post|||if they mean it, they should invite 'israel' to nepal, and 'band up'..|||Well in this conflict there is no good/ evil side. Urban conflict is incredbly costly both in terms of lives and capital. Hamas is using gurilla tactics using civilian infrastructure as their base of operations. And i dont blame hamas for using these civilian infrastructure honestly cause isreali military is superior to hamas and this is the only way they could contend. Isreal seems determined to be a jewish state and palestinians elected hamas themselves. So imo both are in the wrong from my moral perspective.  And if you wanna blame someone for this conflict better blame it on the british.|||some man-made so called peaceful communities, religion are made for these things.|||And how do you know “People in those hospitals and cities were not Hamas members or its supporters?”|||How many post have you made when Hamas killed Bipin Joshi and other 10 Innocent Nepali students who have nothing to do in war and how many posts you have made when Hamas attack first on unarmed civilians they didn't even spare children and pets they didn't bomb them sky they killed them knowingly directly on face. Why you have so much empathy for terrorist Hamas who hiding in hospital and school after killing innocent people and not for our own Nepali bothers and innocent people and children killed by Hamas. Supporting palestine now become a fashion for people like you which is funded by Qatar and other extremist islamic countries who treat non muslims like slaves.|||No side is good .

So the narrative usualy goes like \" hamas killed and hold people of isreal or other natioanlities hostages so all other non hamas palestine people are also accountable\" which doesnot hold true.   Non hamas palestine people are also victim to hamas actions and have share uncessarily shared blame and hate due to hamas.   Anti palestine uses this narrative effectively. And when palestine people are blamed for hamas action. They are forced by circumtasces to show support to hamas to save them from their predicament (isreal genocide)",

Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?

I’m currently abroad, but my mom and my rabbit were at home. The noise was so intense that even over the phone, I could hear it in the background. My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous.

From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India.

They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.

Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||Tier1 college in India and now at Microsoft, best entrypoint is a good college in India and there are so many schemes like DASA, SII, ICCR, Compex to help you get in.

But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

So you can imagine the shallow interaction between the sexes. As a result many guys dont have a clue on how to talk to women, dunno if its true for the other side.

But this doesn't mean we should use society as an excuse to avoid personal accountability. Every man is still responsible for unlearning harmful behavior and trying to be a better person.

You will get trap for unnecessary drama both for men as well as women and never ending fight. Better is to not marry than marry someone whom you don't like.|||There are more men than women. Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.      Nepal and India(depending upon urbanization)   Arranged marriage divorce rate: <5%  Love marriage divorce rate: 35-50%|||You can't blame just men on this.

The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.

And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

The cheap YouTube channel should be banned.|||OP youre a fucking pig, i know for a fact you're a paradygm employee being paid a measly salary they can afford writing this to try to defame him even further lmao, its his fault that he got defamed and now its \"victim\" mindset to ask for compensation and closure?   When a whore and a group of manipulators ruined all his effort, talent and the career he had built for himself?   fuck off. Your post is gpt generated garbage, with no human critique or elements be a man, be a human instead of a corporate slave being paid next to nothing.|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan. Why Don’t we point it out?|||Hamro Nepal ko superstar vanaudo cha ni euta pakhey..  tyo jastai good night matra vanna gaako maanche lai k k vanira hau guys|||a simple question to everyone who's out there saying \"power ra paisa ko bhar ma judiciary le decision dinxa\". if so, why did he not buy the district court in the first place , why high court? why the victim didn't go to supreme court?

Everything is so rapid and it's hard to grasp everything.      The bitter part for me is teachers and even classmates to some extent are strangers.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don’t look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ²|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

I'd ask the government or related authorities to fast-track the case cause he's the hopeful leader in this time.

If recovery isn’t possible, does anyone know **any trusted shops, vendors, or businesses that buy or accept large NTC balances** (maybe at a discounted rate)?

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:** If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from [Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.   Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:** The Reddit user can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:** NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:** They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code `*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#` to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:** For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:** The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:** The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.   Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:** Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:** The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves. |||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..😝|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

You call him a “joke,” but after decades of political recycling where the same men switched parties like football jerseys, someone from outside the elite caste circle was bound to disrupt the echo chamber. Harka represents what Kathmandu elites fear most — accountability without permission. He talks rough, works with his hands, and doesn’t stage photo ops with donor-funded SUVs. Sure, he’s raw, but that’s exactly what Nepal needs when 27% of GDP comes from remittance and the rest is glued together by corruption and loans. The real joke isn’t Harka — it’s a political class that made honest action look radical. In a country where “leaders” vanish after elections, someone building water pipes by hand is treated like a meme? Maybe the problem isn’t Harka’s publicity — maybe it’s our comfort with hypocrisy.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces.

I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It’s really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.

While this might be due to the fact that the first recruiting officer is generally a junior does not understand the courtesy, even senior HR officers tend to do that.

Many talented individuals are even losing jobs and opportunities simply because there’s no reliable way to get paid for their work.  This issue directly impacts Nepal’s growing digital workforce and limits the country’s potential in the global freelancing market. I kindly request you to post about this problem and urge the Finance Minister and related authorities to take action.  Your platform has a powerful voice, and raising this concern could help push for real change.  Thank you for your time and for always being the voice of the people.  Warm regards, [Your Name",

I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

The cheap YouTube channel should be banned.|||OP youre a fucking pig, i know for a fact you're a paradygm employee being paid a measly salary they can afford writing this to try to defame him even further lmao, its his fault that he got defamed and now its \"victim\" mindset to ask for compensation and closure?   When a whore and a group of manipulators ruined all his effort, talent and the career he had built for himself?   fuck off. Your post is gpt generated garbage, with no human critique or elements be a man, be a human instead of a corporate slave being paid next to nothing.|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan.

Hope he didn't suffer much and rest in peace 🙏|||The internet is portraying Hamas as freedom fighters as if they didn't kill innocent people as well. Honestly, I don't care who is in the right or wrong; the only thing I wish is that Hamas pays for killing Nepali brothers and Sisters.|||हार्दिक श्रद्धाञ्जली वीर सपुत…  विपिनले कोठामा छिरेको ग्रिनेड बाहिर फ्याँकेको भनेर उनका साथीहरूले भनेको थियो।|||It has not been officially confirmed whether Bipin Joshi is alive or dead. The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel? I hope the war is not over. Hamas needs to be brought into their knees. This cease fire is a win for then.|||https://preview.redd.it/ceus40waktuf1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a16b17c85993ea6e147deac0acc96858a1434e  from [https://www.setopati.com/politics/371509](https://www.setopati.com/politics/371509)|||Is the news of his death confirmed?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel’s crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining “context” over our dead. Nepal, rise, reject this death cult, or lose more Bipins. #NepalStands #HateKills #GenZFails|||also euta kura sachhauna mann lagyo yo Rest in peace vanne sabda christain haru ko ho , they do not believe in re-incarnation so they say that rest in peace so that they won’t come back but hamro hindu sanskar ma we believe in next janma and we say “ Hardik shradhhanjali “|||[deleted]|||Bro what|||We had hope.

The chief guest was Mahabir Pun and a minister from Biratnagar (I really don't know who he was or what minister, but he was pretty high ranking). The guy was there in suit, garlands and several bodyguards while he sat at the stage. Mahabir Pun, on the other hand, was there on his shorts and a shirt. The minister guy gave a speech before the program commenced, and he spoke for about 15/20 minutes. Then Mahabir Pun gave his speech, literally 2 or 3 minutes long, where he managed to say everything the other guy said, but also enunciated how proud he was seeing all the young people in the room. That's when I knew about the humility of the guy. His comments after each presentations were great too, as he was really supportive of all ideas, whereas the minister looked bored to death the entire time.|||That is brand new information  👏👏|||Still the GOAT|||Mahabirgoat inspiring youth to breath through their nose and not through their mouth as Chronic  breathing though mouth can affect jaw and dental structure.|||Tesaile ta kulman khass chha, purana dal ko neta le ch@k batw saas ferera pollution garthe ahile kulman le nak batw sas ferera ali pollution kam bhako cha|||Why his eyes different|||Maja it pun can afford drinking petrol bt he chose to drink water.

But the jewelry part seemed interesting 🤨 aile ta chaina recent pins, maybe she made it private? Also, look at this particular pin ‘Sisan’s home’ 🫢  https://preview.redd.it/c37o4sh9pxsf1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc2db48dea27018015d7be85a55730c91035808a|||Srikhala jhole will attack in 1,2,3|||No screenshot re Thukka|||We get your point OP! Follow the pattern… the outfits, the wedding decorations, jewellery, she made it come to reality. She followed it diligently - color, design, looks, everything. Likewise, will be her uncountable homes and more plethora of jewellery. You are making people aware what she was upto on the days of the protests and the tragedy of losing innocent lives. Some people will always defend her no matter what as most of them are paid PR people.   Her homes which she shared with the husband are perhaps and most probably their upcoming homes and redecorations which she has said she is renovating three of her houses. The Sirohiya house that was burnt down was surprisingly not lavish at all despite the corruption scale. They are of course building a new house, what else would you do with all that black money. She wants to get into politics and the scale of the house will be similar. She does everything for the clout and to portray this picture perfect curated lifestyle.  Whenever someone wants to warn people, they are always ridiculed. There were people who exposed her long time back but they were also met with unfair repercussions. People are speaking up now because her hypocrisy has been on the forefront.  You did your job, let the people do whatever they want with the info. When the time comes, they will think back and say yes there were signs but….This is exactly how the corruption went overboard cause few people called out things but they were never taken seriously, this continued for decades giving the corrupt people the benefit of the doubt and even after they have been exposed now, they still have the audacity to say that they have been nothing but victims. All happened because no one listened, no one cared, no one acknowledged and there was no accountability until it was too late.  Srinkhala, her parents, her in laws and her husband are frauds and parasites. Everyone knows that but still some people don’t want to accept it and live in denial. Her brother was supposed to get married the week or following after the protests. It’s a fact! She did not disclose this, the media did. She pinned the jewelry ideas around the same time and if people still defend her then just leave it at that. If the protests did not happen, we would have seen her never ending posts about the wedding, what she wore, what she is working on as “an architect”. Her home- her dream project will be a lavish one because it has to match her ambition and ego. She makes everything about herself, you think she won’t make her dream project about herself? Then she will come out and say it was all her vision, she got inspired by this sustainability and how her husband guided her into making better decisions like her wedding speech.  If she was really talented, her Gaatha and skincare line would not have been what it is today. Whatever little publicity those are getting are because she has been endorsing both. Nepal ma alikati kei ramro bhayo ki successful bhaihalcha. Yo ta jhan afailay endorse gareko brainchild ho re in her own words. If it is not making any rounds and not doing well then there is clearly no talent with the amount of money, position, connections, power and influence that she has especially after getting married.  So thank you for sharing what you saw to make us aware. You can’t do anything with people who want to turn a blind eye and stay oblivious/ ignorant. Bujhnay le bujhihalchan.  Yo ta kei hoina, people will see how ruthlessly ambitious she is in coming days with political scenario. “Samanya ghar ko tapai hami jasto manchay” dekhcha balla manchay haru le when it’s too little too late. I would not be surprised if she wins in election because Nepal ma paisa bhae pachi jaslay j garna ni sakcha.  You warned people and your job is done. Don’t get disheartened by people’s comments. Most of them are hired help anyways.|||Why wouldn’t she have all the luxuries in the universe, after all she is BHRASTACHARI ko chori DALAL ko buhari ani HATIYARA ko sirmati. 🐍🐍|||J garnu xa garos.

Will bet that is how her day starts and ends.  Ofcourse she will be more careful now after her cringe fest posts and your post. Lesson learned- get the screenshots when u find things. You can always decide whether to share or not. For now, I think saving and sharing those would have exposed her more for people who are gullible and want to remain ignorant.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. 😭😭2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye 😭|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I thought I’d go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that… but now, I don’t even feel like staying in science. Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me — social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",
