My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

            "body": "THE DREAM  OF  INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION.                THE DREAM OF INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION  It was the most wholesome night I’ve ever had—the kind of night my soul will crave even if it is buried in hell. So what made that night so great? Comrade, night doesn’t come alone; it comes with sleep, and sleep comes with a dream that somehow connects to our present reality. The reason different people dream of different worlds lies in the difference in their realities. A doubt may arise here too: if twin best friends share the same amount of knowledge, experience, and visuals, and somehow make their subconscious similar to each other, do they dream the same things?  Comrade, that night I gave the best speech of my life. After leading a massive worldwide revolution, my intellect and our fellow comrades took control of the earth. We had followers in every country who stood strictly by our political philosophy above religion and nationality. I was so happy in that dream. It felt like the victory of the “curious mind.”  I’ve always compared political parties to sheep and dogs. Sheep are the followers who blindly follow their leaders, and dogs are those who remain loyal only to the throne and nothing else. There hasn’t been a single leader in history who has worked in favor of all citizens. They prioritize their own relatives, the rich (those who provide funds to the parties), loyal followers, and a few development projects meant mainly to spread their name and legacy. They build statues of themselves, letting people believe they are honoring a favorite leader who supposedly took the country’s pride and dignity to the next level. Such hypocrisy.  Political persons and leaders are overrated. People overpraise them, believing rulers to be gods. I’ve read that in ancient Western times, people even called themselves gods. Leaders always take advantage of their power—of people, and even prostitutes. It’s the dirtiest game that exists. But comrade, I’m not here to expose their hypocrisy; this revolution has already done that. Now I see the whole world filled with intellectuals.  The Intellectual Revolution has succeeded. In this world, workers are paid according to their intellectual contribution, the risk involved, working hours, and the luxuries they cannot afford. In my region, people are involved in apple cultivation. Suppose there are 1,000 workers in total—500 in transportation and the rest in caring for the apples. All of them receive an equal salary of 1 lakh per month. Bonuses are paid to workers who get injured, take more risks, or whose hard work directly reflects the profit of the business. They make a profit of 50 million a year. Fifty percent of that profit goes to market expansion, new projects, infrastructure development, and others. The remaining 50 percent is distributed equally among all workers engaged in the field, along with other benefits—even customers are entitled to a share of the profit. Comrade, this has ended inequality in my region.  I can hear the loud voice of the crowd. Around 1 billion are watching online, and 1 million are present at the speech. I see new hope for a fully intellectually developed world where there is no hunger, poverty, or inequality. Everyone receives basic necessities for free, including access to knowledge, medical care, food, shelter, and proper waste management. People engage more in art, creativity, science, environmental balance, and global brotherhood. The ego of “I am greater” and “I am lower” has ended in my dream world.  Someday, I’ll write about how this can be done practically. But for now, let me sleep again, so I can dream of that beautiful world where my dream of an intellectual revolution has already been accomplished—and where I am the new greatest leader of all time 🙆.",

As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

            "body": "I want to share an interview experience I had today with **Avinto located in sanepa**, mainly as feedback and a caution for other candidates.  I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

Many companies lack basic knowledge of labor regulations and do not understand how to properly treat employees or how to handle hiring and termination processes.  I have personally experienced this multiple times, including facing discrimination during interviews. The HR policies in many Nepalese companies are extremely weak and poorly implemented.  I understand how you’re feeling right now, and my point is simply this: Nepalese companies need to adopt a culture of respect, professionalism, and fair treatment toward employees.|||And they're the same that'll try to act extra professional later ...wannabe professional kinda shii with little to no manners at all|||Company ko culture jhalkincha.

            "body": "I’m a Go developer building a SaaS product. After integrating eSewa, Khalti, and ConnectIPS for the third time, I’ve decided I’m done writing \"glue code\" for every new project.  I am going to build a **Unified Nepal Payments Core** in Go.  I’m building this regardless because I need it for my own production environment, but I wanted to check with developer here if you have faced same problem and how you have solved it?  **The Problem I’m Solving (For myself, and maybe you):**  1. Architecture Mismatch: eSewa forces a legacy HTML Form POST. Khalti is JSON. ConnectIPS needs certificates. My business logic shouldn't care about these transport details. I just want a clean interface. 2. Verification Anxiety: Most tutorials I see online skip the strict signature/HMAC verification steps. I want a library that handles the crypto correctly by default so I don't have to worry about replay attacks or amount spoofing. 3. Standardized Errors: I’m tired of parsing inconsistent error responses. I want the SDK to return a standard `payment.ErrInsufficientFunds` or `payment.ErrTimeout` regardless of the underlying provider.  **The Plan:**  A \"two-layer\" architecture:  1. **Core (Open Source):** The interfaces, data models, and verification logic. 2. **Providers:** Plugins for eSewa, Khalti, IPS, etc.  **The Interface Goal:**      // 1. Setup (done once)     client := esewa.New(os.Getenv(\"ESEWA_SECRET\"))     // 2. Pay (Standard across all providers)     // I don't care if it's a Form POST or API call internally     resp, err := core.Initiate(ctx, client, &payment.Request{                  Amount: 1000,                  OrderID: \"ORD-101\",                  })  I know many developer here are Node/Python, but for the Go developers in Nepal:  1. Is this something you’d actually use in production, or do you prefer writing your own integrations to keep dependencies low? 2. If I open-source the Core interfaces, would anyone be interested in helping review the security/verification logic?",

Perform API testing using Postman. 3. Understand manual testing fundamentals. (test cases, bug reporting, SDLC basics) 4. Comfortable reading and understanding backend code.  I know the job market is very difficult for juniors right now, especially for QA Automation roles, but I’m genuinely motivated and willing to put in the hard work to improve and contribute.  I’m looking for: - Internship or trainee QA roles. - Junior QA Automation opportunities where I can learn and grow. - Advice on how to break into QA Automation in the current market.  Any guidance, referrals, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your time.",

Why should Nepali audiences give a Fck about an Indian cricketer getting engaged or dating someone? How is that relevant to Nepal or its people?  Indian news outlets don’t cover who Paras Khadka is dating. So why are we being fed Bollywood style gossip about Indian celebrities as “news”?  Nepali media pages should focus on things that actually matter to Nepal: politics, economy, education, infrastructure, or even our own sports and culture. Pages like Routine of Nepal Banda have massive reach, and with that reach comes responsibility. Filling people’s feeds with celebrity gossip instead of meaningful information is a missed opportunity.",

My mother did everything provider, protector, decision maker. For me, that was just normal.  Then in 6th grade, school made me realize how the world actually works.  I noticed that my school ID had my father’s name listed as my guardian. Since he was already dead, my mother’s phone number was there instead. It felt strange and wrong to me, so I went to the administration and asked them to replace my father’s name with my mother’s.  They refused.  They told me it was “not their policy” and that they cannot put a mother’s name as the guardian on the ID.  I remember standing there, confused more than angry. My mother was alive. She was the one raising me. Yet, on paper, she wasn’t allowed to exist unless attached to a man even a dead one.  That was the first time I realized how deeply male dominance is built into systems, not just attitudes. It wasn’t someone insulting women or making jokes it was quiet, official, and normalized.  Curious to hear from others: when did you first notice something like this?",

Plus every financial decision goes through my mom first and last.

At my house, we were not allowed to touch cheli-beti's with our feet. We had to do goda dhoyera khane ritual. Had to gift them at special occasion. You know kanya puja. And the things offered to gods only they could eat, etc.   Now, what really got me was how a girl is treated like a goddess and given all those treatment when they are at home. But the same women after marriage have to bow down to all her in-laws. Serve them like a literal slave. Their position is not of a family member but of helper and baby production machine.   This stark polarity or how women were treated made me realise how twisted the misogyny is in our society. It is not plain old women are inferior thing. It is downgradation of a society which used to be egalitarian. Which is a tragedy in itself.|||when i had access to internet, honestly.

I’m not from Kathmandu, but I’m planning to take the IELTS exam soon as I want to go abroad for my further studies.  I come from a family of four siblings, so I couldn’t afford to join IELTS preparation classes. Instead, I prepared on my own using YouTube and other free online resources. Now, I’m ready to book my test date, but I’m a bit confused about the process.  I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me with the some information:)   How much does the computer-based IELTS exam cost in Nepal?  Is it possible to get a test date around January 19 or 20?  If anyone has experience booking the exam themselves, or if there’s someone from a consultancy who’s willing to guide me, I’d be very grateful.  Any information or guidance would mean a lot to me. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this 🙏",

In my opinion we've lost the true meaning by not having Kailasa into our territory. And remember what chanakya said if you're in between 2 powerful nations the priority should be to be sovereign, your destiny is to be absorbed into either one by some foolish leaders but it's the test of the leader as well to not be absorbed and he adds always side with the one which is weaker. We need to be more Indian aligned but not India, I can't even think of calling pedophile Gandhi as my father of the nation.|||I am not here to piss you guys but just to state some facts.   Back in the 1950s, Nepali King of that time did discuss this option - to merge with India, with Nehru.  Nehru politely refused that offer.   It was an informal offer from the then King of Nepal as he wanted to end the autocratic rule of the Rana dynasty in Nepal and he saw how Nehru ended all that in India. Therefore there is no official written record of it as the request was informal.   Secondly, India till date has never tried to merge Nepal in any way, we might have minor border issues that too on a very small border area.   Thirdly, Nepalese have to understand that because of it's unique strategic location, Nepali land is a \"safe haven\" for all the big & powerful intelligence agencies of the world that includes-US, UK, France,  Russia, Germany, China, Japan, and the worst - Pakistan, to plan & carry out all the dirty activities in India, China, South & East Asia.  Kathmandu is the playground of all the big powerful intelligence agencies.  because of its very unique & strategic geo-location and because of a  big buffer between the two most populous and nuclear armed countries, Nepal has become very important. If India moves out completely from Nepal then China will push itself in ..... oh wait a minute they are already pushing themselves in for decades now.",

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is.

            "comments": "From what I’ve seen, many Nepalis abroad stick together because it’s simply easier. Language affects how you express humour and personality, and when you’re not fully comfortable, socialising becomes exhausting.   Most people abroad bond over shared interests, but many Nepalis are still figuring themselves out while juggling work, visas, and family responsibilities. Being around other Nepalis removes that pressure.   Also - sense of belonging and community plays a huge role.|||this is the same w every immigrant group in every country|||Birds of same feather …|||Bidesh aau ani tahapauchau bhai|||Not just nepali , all naso same ho ..|||I think it depends on the situation.

When there were get togethers of Nepalis I'd rarely go because I didn't want to be pulled into the bubble and get stuck there. The few times I hung out with Nepalis I realized they're basically living in Nepal with Nepali mentality while abroad. Many had moved abroad and lived there for decades but were still unaware of many Western customs-they just didn't assimilate into the culture. I could see how much they missed out on. I just didn't want to be in that situation. So, you're right, because as many others have mentioned, immigrants don't get out of their comfort zone, they miss out on a lot. It's unfortunate.|||bidesh ma sabai immigrants testai ho…obviously halka fulkha bideshi sathi pani huncha tara mostly afu afu nai ho|||It depends bro. Once you immigrate you belong to nowhere.

For most young people: -   Most Nepali come here to work on a student visa, not for study. They enroll in a cheap college which is mostly populated with Nepali or foreigners from south asian countries.   Then, they need to find work, since they can’t work more than 20 hours legally, they need to find work in cash, so they need to network with Nepali people who work in cash to bypass the work hour requirements.   Then, they need to find a cheap place to stay. Probably 2-4 people crammed in a single room sleeping in bunk beds. Guess who is willing to do that ? Other Nepali or south asians.   For married couples :  They don’t live in crammed rooms but navigating lives and work pressures help them better relate with eachother than foreigners of that land.  ——————————  It is not a nepali trait or south asian trait. It is a socio-economic trait.   Nepali students who actually can afford their tuition without working illegally having a partner just to make ends meet live a completely different life.   They have the luxury to go out after college to socialize, visit new places with friends, participate in clubs and events. Become members of universities bodies, a representative or host in Universities, and many other involvement where they make connections with people of all backgrounds. They explore leadership opportunities and develop their social skills.  All this while most Nepali students don’t have enough time to sleep cus they have to earn, pay for tuition and send money back home. God bless them, they are so tough. I could have never been able to do that.   ———————  I was lucky enough not to worry about money and my tuition. So i had a lot of free time. There was a point where I knew almost everyone in my Uni ( literally speaking ) and i used to host weekly events in uni. I have got friends from all over the globe. I knew just 2 nepali people from my uni, just 2 ( one was a girl i dated, if i wasn’t dating her, I don’t think we would have spent any time together ). I tried to find more but i never bumped into nepali people in any in places i found myself in.   Not a single Nepali person besides me, in my entire college degree, across all courses. Not a single Nepali person in any events I attended. I was the only Nepali in the first two jobs i did.   Unless i went to nepali events, i was not around Nepali people. I go to Nepali events just to meet Nepali people so i can make more Nepali friends because almost none of my friends are Nepali.   ———————  So yeah, there are some language and cultural barriers but these are insignificant. I think the socioeconomic barrier is the biggest reason why Nepali people stick together. Although for some people the cultural barriers might hold more weight|||Most People are naturally attracted to people  similar to them|||It really depends on Where you're located and type of Community you in.

I have a handful of non-Nepali friends whom I truly value and enjoy. It’s not that I don’t want Nepali friends but I simply don’t have many Nepali people around me that are my age to regularly hang out with (Nepali population that I have seen around me are either they are college students way too younger or way too older with kids). I do meet Nepali didi, dai, and bhauju occasionally during festivals or events, but we don’t spend time together often. Most of my friendships naturally formed through work. I came to US and started working directly!  So I have worked in 2 firms so far, I haven’t met any Nepali.   I also feel that if you move abroad for education, you’re more likely to meet many Nepali friends. There’s a sense of comfort and support, and people often help each other through shared experiences so it’s natural for them to stick together.  But hey at the end of the day whatever floats your boat!  🎉|||Birds of the same feather flock together bhanne sunya chha? Besides, how do you know they only hang out with Nepalese?

Did we really cross ethnic lines in Nepal or did we stay comfortably within our own circles? Did a Pahadi genuinely sit, eat, celebrate, and struggle alongside a Madhesi and vice versa? How many close friends did we truly have from so called lower castes not just as acquaintances but as people we regularly hung out with, defended, and learned from? How many of us who ask this question actually learned Maithili, Bhojpuri, Newari, Tamang, Gurung, or Tharu by choice and not because we had to?  If we did not assimilate in a country as diverse as Nepal, why do we expect people to suddenly become global citizens the moment they cross a border?  Isn’t it human nature to seek familiarity when everything else language, culture, food, accent is unfamiliar? When someone is already navigating visas, racism, homesickness, and identity struggles, is it really surprising that they hold on to the one space where they do not have to explain themselves?  And when Nepalis abroad spend time with other Nepalis, is it exclusion or survival? Is posting vlogs and photos with familiar faces a rejection of the world or simply documenting comfort? Do we ask the same questions about Italians Chinese or Mexicans abroad or do we reserve this criticism only for Nepalis?  Maybe the real question is not why they do not explore but why we romanticize exploration abroad while ignoring the lack of it at home.  If we could not fully embrace diversity in Nepal a country with dozens of languages countless cultures and everyday diversity, what makes us think a plane ticket alone changes that?|||1) Just because you want to hang out with them doesn’t necessarily mean they also wanna do the same. Lot of White colored people do want to hangout with other white people only. Lot of white people only want to date white people. It doesn’t have to be racism and could just be of choice. Whats happening in the US today isn’t happening because of 1 person disliking non white population, there are many as such. So yea, for 1 they also do not like to hangout with non white people so thats kinda why Nepali are seen hanging out with their own.  2) Its also not very easy to hangout with different cultures. The reason nepali people gets along with Indians is due to commonality between our culture the way we are brought up. That just makes it easy to communicate and of course functions and religion bring us together. Sometimes our upbringing makes it so difficult to hangout with white culture. Something Thats very basic or normal to us might be offending to them.   These are some basic reasons why nepali are seen hanging out with other nepali or just desi community. Even our struggles are similar, so it’s out of convenience and commonalities.|||Why do Nepali people abroad only eat Nepali food?? There are so many better options|||I avoid Nepalis like the plague",

            "body": "As part of our standard check-in procedure in our hotel, when a couple arrives, we require government-issued IDs from both individuals and both signatures on the registration form.  But, I observed that we are frequently facing resistance especially when requesting the girl’s ID and signature. Most of the couple argue saying this rule exists “only in our hotel” or refuse outright. Because of this, a lot of young couples choose not to stay.  Our intention behind this policy is not to harass or embarrass anyone. There are clear reasons for it:  Both signatures confirm mutual consent to stay esp in regards to couples, protecting both guests and the hotel from future disputes or false claims.  Both IDs are important for legal accountability in case of any incident, complaint, or investigation.  Plus it also verifies the real age of both individuals, ensuring there are no underage- related legal issues.  Despite being a reputed hotel and following this policy consistently for safety and legal compliance, we’re now questioning whether this is seen as excessive.  So my genuine question is: Are we being too strict by asking for both partners’ IDs and signatures?????",

Your demand for both id will surely make most of the couple either go somewhere else or not return again to your hotel.

He was against the idea of nepali congress joining the coalition multiple times but deuba had the majority and made decisions. Now everyone's seeing whats been going on Congress since forever.  Why deuba and his close ones are trying their best to hang in power? If they lose the grip, Arzu deuba , PS Mahat , Nidhi, Prakash Man Singh all their political career is gone and high chances they'll be behind bars.

Case 2: Deuba and old parties are instructed to hold on to power by India and China.  Why?- Lets look in Europe. Lookup Victoria Nuland: she is high level US diplomat (probably retired now)believed to be the mastermind behind election of Zelensky in Ukraine and probably pushing for the war (there are leaked audio clips too probably available in internet.).  A coincidence that she happened to have visited Nepal and Bangladesh in 2023.   A coincidence that most of the emerging Gen-Z leaders happen to have ties to US and Europe supported leadership programs. For instance Rakshya Bam was part of it back in 2021-22 or something like that. Let us not forget that that Late King Birendra was killed in one of the most secured places in Nepal. Something about police shooting young people all of sudden doesn’t make sense at all.   A coincidence that she is closely linked with Gagan Thapa who coincidently happens to have the biggest voice for MCC and has close ties with US embassy. Could be a ploy to weaken existing parties to bring RSP to power. With RSP in power you get a government and youngsters who grew up hating neighbours (india and china-probably china not as much)which can now be easily manipulated and controlled.  Why again? India and China are aligning with Russia and in process of formation of alliance to stand up against US. Lookup BRICS. Not to forget their rise and rising dominance in global trade while US is sinking in debt.  Nepal, bangladesh, pakistan are going to be nerves which US and Europe would like to press every now and then to pressure India and China.   Could it be that Nepal is just a battleground for war being fought somewhere else? Very likely.   I would not be surprised if Nepal turns into a battleground in next 5-10 years, where madesh, free Tibet and gorkhaland issues start to resurface.  Interesting and dark times could be ahead. Probably not the best times to godify western taught youth leaders to align and take command of Nepal. Tada ko deuta vanda najik ko bhoot thik. Probably need organic nepali politicians to lead. Best case scenario for Nepal could be the return of king or have pro-china or pro-india gov. Gagan is probably not the best person. Possibly why Deuba could be backed by India and KP and PKD by china.  Chances are there are bigger things at play. See what happens.",

I don’t talk about them for the same reason I don’t complain that a dead body isn't working, everyone knows they are the past. My disappointment comes from the living hope we have today.  When the 2025 Gen Z movement happened, the country was ready to give Balen everything. He chose to pass that power to an interim government led by Sushila Karki. We trusted her because he told us to. Today, as 76 families still wait for justice and the murderers are still protected, why is the man who gave the guarantee staying silent? Is silence a leadership quality, or is it an exit strategy?  People call Harka 'aggressive' or 'a laborer.' But remember: this man refused a Home Ministry post because he wouldn't bow at a foreign embassy for a 'stamp of approval.' He chose the soil over a seat. While the privileged mock his 'muddy hands,' he is the only one showing us what a sovereign leader looks like. Why are we so comfortable with 'polite' silence and so offended by 'honest' noise?  If we don't hold them accountable now, how are the 'New Parties' any different from the 'Old' ones by the time we reach the ballot box?",

During that time, the CEO blamed me for negative reviews on the Google Play Store. Those reviews were related to a feature that I had never implemented, nor was I ever asked to fix. The CEO repeatedly blamed me and expected an intern to take ownership of the entire application. Apart from that, employees at the company never received public holidays—even during Holi, the CEO did not grant a holiday. Office hours were from 10 AM to 5 PM, six days a week, yet we were still expected to work after 5 PM. There was no proper guidance provided to interns, but the CEO expected intern-level employees to perform at the level of senior software engineers.|||Ma ta jata gayo sab mero against ma morchabandi garera malai eklai parera sab milera mero kura katdai basxan.

Also managers who say “we’re like a family” but shut down feedback or punish boundaries. Learned that the hard way!|||Heres my story.   I worked in an American Company. I had initially worked in a department  that handles projects. Then I switched to another department seeking growth.  I served in the department for a year. Then the Head of our function decided they wanted to switch departments. When they moved the business deemed our function redundant and moved our team to completely random teams. (Red Flag 1)   I was placed into a function which I had no idea about. It was not my strength, and I had asked countless times to move me. Additionally my manager was a person who was not understanding at all. They had developed a role that was well above my current grade. When I confronted them about it, they just said we'll see. (Red Flag 2)  My manager then began to criticize everything I did. They began to complain about everything. From my working hours to the way I completed work. When I reported a problem, after proactively checking in with the respective stakeholders, my manager's response was to criticize me because I did not report this problem earlier. I like to automate things, she criticized me claiming  I was lazy and I looked to automate everything. (Red Flag 3)   Regardless of these situations, I decided to persevere and keep on working. Unfortunately I got really sick with Migraines. I sent my manager photos of my thermometer and the doctors note. They approved my leave without any fuss which was kinda suspicious.   When I joined work back on Monday. My manager was awfully chill about everything. They wanted to schedule a meeting with me. Being naive i didn't think too much of it but I could see that HR and Finance Managers were also in the meeting. I understood what was about to happen. I joined the meeting and got laid off.   TLDR: The workplace was trying to get rid of me, and avoid paying severance by placing me with an awful manager. However, I persevered and played along and got some severance in the end.|||hired as a intern (for final yr colz), worked web dev, winform dev, tech support. assigned whole website and ERP alone. sometimes, techsupport whole day with no time to do webapp, constantly rushed by coworkers and boss to complete the app while asking me to give techsupport (so sometimes even worked overtime at home). I already had 2-3yrs of experience in web dev before joining but was new to winform and techsupport.  the female coworkers had bad experience with boss and his son, they urged me to leave as well and I'm glad I did. I stayed there for 3 months, helped make company site and a management app alone, also some apps for automation and QOL.  they didn't paid me for 2months and I was about to leave but they offered me senior position afterwards, yet I left. Later they asked me to submit my projects and they would pay me my salary, I did, they never did. I called, do whatever you want I wont be giving it back.  After leaving still with no job but glad I left.|||I've been lucky to get amazing managers to work with. Instead of red flags, I can tell you what made them great managers.   No. 1 ta micromanage nagarne nai ho. Arko chai supportive culture ho, meaning they are always looking out for your well-being and becoming patient towards juniors. Mistakes teach you lessons, tara toxic culture ma mistakes are discouraged entirely. You should also not be afraid to share ideas and vision with your manager. When there is fear, there are limited learning opportunities and it ultimately shows in your mental health.|||Damn... it's a looooong story..😰",

The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering.

As a final-year CSIT student, I didn't have a corporate budget, so I had to be strategic with free and low-cost resources.  I see a lot of people asking if 1 month is enough. It is, but I studied **6 hours a day** strictly. Here is exactly how I did it.  **The Timeline (30 Days)**  * **Days 1-12:** Watched the FreeCodeCamp AWS course (Andrew Brown) on YouTube. I didn't just watch; I took notes on *everything*. * **Days 13-20:** Deep dive into **Tutorials Dojo Cheatsheets**. This was a lifesaver for confusing topics like VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway. * **Days 21-29:** The Grind. I used **ExamPrepper** and went through **1,019 practice questions**. * **Day 30:** Rest & Light review.  **The Resources:**  1. **FreeCodeCamp (YouTube):** Best free resource to understand the basics. 2. **Tutorials Dojo (Cheatsheets):** Mandatory for understanding the small differences between services. 3. **ExamPrepper:** I did 1,000+ questions. This helped me build speed and learn to spot \"distractor\" answers.  **Exam Experience:** The questions were wordy. Managing time was harder than I thought. Because I practiced so many questions beforehand, I could quickly identify keywords (e.g., \"highly available\" vs \"cost-optimized\").  Happy to answer any questions about the exam or my schedule!",

            "body": "I’m a Go developer building a SaaS product. After integrating eSewa, Khalti, and ConnectIPS for the third time, I’ve decided I’m done writing \"glue code\" for every new project.  I am going to build a **Unified Nepal Payments Core** in Go.  I’m building this regardless because I need it for my own production environment, but I wanted to check with developer here if you have faced same problem and how you have solved it?  **The Problem I’m Solving (For myself, and maybe you):**  1. Architecture Mismatch: eSewa forces a legacy HTML Form POST. Khalti is JSON. ConnectIPS needs certificates. My business logic shouldn't care about these transport details. I just want a clean interface. 2. Verification Anxiety: Most tutorials I see online skip the strict signature/HMAC verification steps. I want a library that handles the crypto correctly by default so I don't have to worry about replay attacks or amount spoofing. 3. Standardized Errors: I’m tired of parsing inconsistent error responses. I want the SDK to return a standard `payment.ErrInsufficientFunds` or `payment.ErrTimeout` regardless of the underlying provider.  **The Plan:**  A \"two-layer\" architecture:  1. **Core (Open Source):** The interfaces, data models, and verification logic. 2. **Providers:** Plugins for eSewa, Khalti, IPS, etc.  **The Interface Goal:**      // 1. Setup (done once)     client := esewa.New(os.Getenv(\"ESEWA_SECRET\"))     // 2. Pay (Standard across all providers)     // I don't care if it's a Form POST or API call internally     resp, err := core.Initiate(ctx, client, &payment.Request{                  Amount: 1000,                  OrderID: \"ORD-101\",                  })  I know many developer here are Node/Python, but for the Go developers in Nepal:  1. Is this something you’d actually use in production, or do you prefer writing your own integrations to keep dependencies low? 2. If I open-source the Core interfaces, would anyone be interested in helping review the security/verification logic?",

For my dream job i need to have good automation skill and for that i need to learn python and linux. As i know linux and networking well by now but i need solid python knowledge as well.   So, anyone willing to learn python from scratch? Share the resources (ofc not paid resources anything free or valuable), someone who enjoys learning and sharing milestones, enjoys doing some projects together.   Thanks for reading up-until here. 🙌   Edit:  feel free to join the discord but please for studying python from beginners level only. I don't know nothing and i mean absolutely nothing so from downloading python to all we are learning from scratch. It's for the one who wants to start learning. Thank you for your considerations.   https://discord.gg/AsU3hZ5M",

            "body": "I’m genuinely curious about RankMeTop’s intern selection  process. I’ve noticed that they post SEO intern positions on LinkedIn very frequently, almost every few days. I’m wondering what kind of interns they are actually looking for, or why they keep opening intern positions so often.  Is it because they receive many applications but don’t select interns easily, or is there another reason (like short-term internships, training batches, or high turnover)?  I’m asking out of curiosity and to better understand how companies manage intern select. If anyone has experience with RankMeTop or similar companies, I’d appreciate your insights.",

Interns would do those monotonous tasks which doesn't require that much of a skill. Maybe they just hire interns for those tasks.|||I joined RMT during my bachelor’s internship phase after passing the intern technical round. It’s been about 1.5 yrs now and I’m currently leading multiple e-commerce projects there. Rankmetop looks for strong researchers and people who genuinely want to learn and grow in SEO. If you enjoy research, experimentation & continuous learning, its a great place to work and build real SEO skills.|||This post is a marketing skit, nothing more.  All the other comments are made by employees from the same company to promote it. This whole post is bullshit. Let me tell you the real thing.  They hire interns for 10k per month. When they take interviews, they tell they have AGRESSIVE work culture. And then when the interns start working, they are given unbelievably high amount of work and responsibilities.  Their whole business revolves around hiring interns and giving all workload. Meanwhile, the project leads do minimal work, and pretend like they did all the work. Absolute dickheads.  What they do is: 1. Assign unrealistic amounts of work to interns. 2. Force them to complete it on time. 3. Obviously, they are unable to cope with the insane workload. 4. Right when the internship ends and they expect to be promoted, company says 'you couldn't meet the work expectations' and fires without notice. 5. Post vacancy again. And repeat.  They put so much pressure on everyone that their so-called 5-day work week becomes a 7-day work week because if you don't complete all tasks, you'll get fired. Typical toxic office shit.  I've been working for nearly a year, and I'm looking for better opportunities right now because these guys are crazy. On top of all the work, they DEMAND that you do home research. If you don't, they call you out for it in front of everyone. What a load of shit.  They also keep all the SEO leads in a hostel together, and there is insane groupism. Those retards cannot see any non-hosteler thrive. They get jealous and band together like a bunch of vultures. It's like a cult.|||I was wondering about the same thing.  I went there for an interview but they didn't call me back. Since last month I have already seen about 5 to 6 openings.I am curious now lol 😂|||Handful of my friends has interviewed for that company like a month ago but for whatever reason they're still looking for interns.|||It might be there marketing strategies.

I got 6/7 right during my exam and recieved an email.  To those who are saying, it might be an advertising strategy, when I joined 6 months ago there were approximately 20 members, but now after 6 months, the total has reached to 40. So you will get an answer from this.  Don't hesitate, do learn, do research, and then do apply.|||https://preview.redd.it/3j0jbazyr8cg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a98b6dddf1f88382d84ecbcc8e6a251c72fe39d  RankMeTop is posting multiple vacancies because the company is growing fast. RankMeTop is closing new deals every day and we have to hire fast to bring result to our clients  All the vacancies posted are valid. As RankMeTop is growing fast so hiring hasn’t stopped.  **It’s a 100 % real growth demand not a marketing tactics**  Check our real time slack channel of new deal closed announcement ( if you prefer looking into data )  If you are trying to build career in SEO, We are still hiring & giving opportunity to everyone who has the potential.

Our own in house team are handling intern hiring as we have connections So you guys see our intern hiring very frequently that goes from company LinkedIn page.  For other positions, it goes through our recruitment partner so you guys don't see much on company LinkedIn post as  **Why RankMeTop Hires SEO Interns more than other ?**  \"Demand-Supply GAP in the market\"  RankMeTop can train interns fast and they start to do the real execution in just few weeks & It's easier to train the fresh minds with our Semantic SEO approach than asking other to unlearn the traditional SEO and re-learn the Semantic Approach...  We have built company from ground up !!! Our current team lead started from Internship   Our current Technical Strategist, On-Page Strategist everyone started from internship position  **So we prefer building our own experts from ground up !!** Who aligns with our culture and values from the start itself      **Let's talk, Why we don't select Candidate easily and Why your friends aren't selected ?**  Our own Whole internal SEO team filters the candidate, not just founder and CEO  When they don't select candidate meaning, our current SEO team don't think they can perform better that's why  Most candidates don't pass on our Technical round of interview that's why they don't get selected  We are still hiring guys !!!  Welcome to the RankMeTop, If you are ready to do whatever it takes to become better at SEO & if you are serious about SEO as a career option.  Hope I could cover all your questions !!  Thank you|||I am an employee there, we are searching for people with research based , problem solving mindset and analytic thinkers because everyday we are faced with new challenges. You won't know everything (obviously) but you need to be able to research (you will be provided all the tools needed too) and find a solution to fix the problem.   That's why we are very selective in our process and if you are able to solve the problem we give you, well you will be selected obviously.  Also you are free to use google in interview so we judge based on how well you can research and come to a conclusion. The questions are made such that even someone with 0 SEO knowledge can search and solve it.  Experienced people don't easily switch companies in this field (my experience atleast) that's why we are constantly searching for people who are willing to research, solve problems and most importantly enjoy what we do.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.  I have compiled all medical records, hospital documents from Australia, and identity proofs in a transparent folder for anyone who wishes to verify our story: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8)  If you can’t donate, please share.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.",

Renu has made a name for herself in Bharatpur but this will be an election for parliament and not mayor. Last election chitwan had a rabi effect where people in other constituencies voted for him because he was contesting from chitwan and his influence was so immense even the constituency in the neighbouring district were effected. Nawalpur which was considered a stronghold of NC nearly lost to RSP in 2079. Also, chitwan - 3 was won by RPP and previously by prachanda. Even though renu had influence in the constituency, they did not risk prachanda. After what happened in sept 23/24, i don't think people are going to vote for individual and would rather vote for a party other than the big 3. Expect to see rabi campaigning aggressively in chitwan -3 than chitwan - 2|||from being chitwan 3 I see it very unlikely Renu would lose this election. Despite she being Prachanda's daughter, she has made a name for herself as a mayor here. If Rabi was going against her, then this would've been a tight competition imo. Yes, ghanti gang do be making noise in chitwan but deep down we all know Renu has brought visible and tangible change on the ground level. I do not support the way she won her last election (a can of worms there) but I do have to acknowledge the work she has done.|||Renu will not lose in Chitwan immovable object|||Media trial, if she runs from chitwan -3, rsp is sacrificing such a gem.

She has done wonders for bharatpur people|||Bikram Pandey laughing from Chitwan 3|||Haha balen lai Mayor re party ko upa sabhapti bhnnera kina nabhneko hol|||RSP can sweep chitwan 3. First, rsp has a good base there. Second, Renu has done some works, but more manipulation of media people and influencers to brand her as developmentalist. She has been surrounded by few controversies. One example: dumping of waste in narayani river. Third, prachanda ran away from chitwan-3 last election thinking ravi will contest from chitwan-3. Ravi´s craze is even more now with balen and kulman joining rsp. A strong rsp candidate can be victorious. Fourth, there is a decline in craze of uml and congress among under 35 people of chitwan. I myself interacted with few people from different wards of bharatpur and madi and barring few, all said they won`t vote for big 3 and bikram pandey and are looking for new political force.  P.S.- Personally, I do not think shobita will contest from chitwan -3 against renu. Her businessman husband is super close with prachanda and even shobita has become close with prachanda due to family matters. Plus she won kathmandu-2 last time just because of ravi craze at that moment. Not even 500 people from kathmandu-2 heard about her before. She is indeed a good orator and law student. i have known her since AYON days when she lost a election in ayon. Besides good oration in parliament, she has literally not done anything for kathmandu -2. ( You can ask any voter of kathmandu 2, like tinkune, sinamangal area, pepsocola what she has done for kathmandu-2 ) I hope rsp will bring some local candidate from chitwan with clean image. If rsp brings shobita, she will definitely cut vote of other candidates and any unpredictable result can come. She can grab good votes, but not enough to win the election.   - And i m not Rsp member or fan, just a curious youth following nepali politics 😀|||Balen mulla KP oli ko against ma uthne bhanera ufrirathiyo ta",

Shady past in U.S. (Active court cases) 2 Sahakari Case ( there are people - common people that are affected by his misadventure at the end of day) 3. Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker.

He had been constantly rising voice against deuba and his associates, he openly criticized NC coalition in election and he also openly said he was against forming of government with UML but majority crushed him, left high level committes of netas created during NC-UML government (indicates he strongly opposed it). firstly have to know about him. Yes he is not the best, but among the choices in NC, he is best. He also ran against Deuba in samsadiya dal inside NC and lost to him(this was just after 79 election)  Everyone says he shows himself as saviour just before election (I gave some data before), yes he should be doing now. Before Gen-z he had been doing it in slow-process but when Gen-z happened he understood his pace is not good and increased his activity. Politics is also game of numbers, before Gen-z majority were aligned to Deuba or were scared of his cartels, but why he did only after Gen-z and 20yrs after being in politics is because,  1. it is only recently when he held substantial power in NC where his voice mattered. Before he was mere MP(there ary many of them) and didn't held any major post inside NC and held just recently. If he had done before, he would have been thrown out of party and this agenda wouldn't have been carried out by anyone. He would have been the BHIM RAWAL of congress. Watch in UML what happened, when one impulse guy, without any strategies and planning went all against Oli. He was thrown out of party yes, but that voice was also changed. 2. He did this after Gen-z(not to take anything with election, if election wasn't announced, NC would have done normal convention) because it was only this time when others were also not satisfied with the Deuba. He just lead this thought of people inside congress dissatisfied and mandate he got from Gen-z that your pace is not good, do decisive, we have heard enough of you. If gen-z wouldn't have happened, everyone would have been aligned with deuba himself, and Gagan didn't had number so, he would have lost the movement and got the punishment from the Leadership. He did this (risking his political career), slowly planning, making strategies and having sense, this time he wouldn't loose. **\\[which shows he has better planning ability to get the result he wanted and this is kind of ability everyone wants is their leader\\]**  Yes, he is not best, but what happening in NC is good. Old should also get filtered. Once this old were the present RaSwaPa and they happend to be this, we need perfect Check and Balance. If NC wouldn't have did this, RaSwaPa would have got much higher seat and they would have done whatever they wanted which is wrong. We want multiple stakeholders who listen and feels the general public and NC is being transformed to that and the man leading Gagan much respect to him.  btw, for this time, my vote is for Ghanti hai (still not best, but among alternative, good than others)|||Nepal doesn’t need another PM who learns governance on the job while the bureaucracy runs circles around them. That experiment has already failed  repeatedly.  The fantasy that “outsiders are pure, insiders are dirty” is childish. Power doesn’t work that way.  You don’t dismantle a cartel by appointing someone who doesn’t even know its hierarchy. You do it by putting in charge someone who knows exactly which doors to kick, which ones to lock, and which ones to burn down.  This is why someone like Gagan Thapa is a more serious PM candidate than any political outsider fantasy.|||Thikei cha aba herum k huncha.

Probably because the party is heading towards breakdown and I am loving the scenario?

People in Nepal are corrupted way earlier than they decide their career path. Literally. As soon as they enter college past SLC, in government campuses they are bombarded by the student union pamphlets, and for fucks sake, heavily influenced by various political parties .

They are taught like , corruption is the every people careers path.  This fucking needs to be stopped. The campus students union should be independent of the political party.  And the students their discuss politics more than 50 % of the time. Some don't even care to study, but just see being in one of the union as a track to success.

The multiparty system, built on the premise of democracy, was far more important for the country. Although it would have taken time for the system to function effectively and for citizens to truly practice democracy, it was a necessary and valuable process.  This system was destroyed through false promises, manufactured hope, and baseless allegations. By exploiting the corruption of a few politicians at the time, and instead of educating the people, innocent citizens were dragged into a civil war. The tourism sector once a key revenue generator collapsed, while agriculture, the backbone of the nation, was severely weakened.  As a result, the country has been pushed back by decades, losing entire generations of progress. All of this traces back to a corrupt process, influenced and engineered by foreign powers to weaken and destabilize the nation, and enabled by this one man. Today, the mass departure of citizens has become a major contributor to the economy through remittances an outcome born of necessity, not progress.  Yet many people remain unaware of these realities. One cannot help but wonder: when will people finally grow up and confront the truth?  And if he wins the election again, it should surprise no one.",

Maile yo pali BSc Microbiology maa join gareko chu (as a backup) and the college asked for my original migration certificate, which I have already submitted, because if i didnt, i would not be able to give exams and that would lead me to drop.  Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र).

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

Next time he might do something even more severe. And at that moment, His response would be something along the lines of the heat of the moment.  You do not deserve to be treated this way, no matter what the reason maybe.    I would suggest to take drastic measures given out by some concerned redditors. Distance yourself from him either by involving & going to your parents home and discussing the plan moving forward or if that is not possible to the authorities.

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||ekchoti uha sanga kura garnus, kina uhale yesto garnu bhayo, k karad thyo, you have already told that he isn't that much violent ani jhagada nabhakai ded barsha bhayo bhanesi he might be going through something,      he might have thought I'm having this that difficulties, while she is having fun and such, and he might have shared his difficulties with his friends who might have said something like, why would your wife stay with you or something.          ekchoti dubai jana time milayera, cool head ka sath kura garnus, kina yesto gareko, kina hatt haleko and such.    yedi yo sab bhayena, communicate nai garna nakhojne ho bhane, usko parents wa tapai kai parents lai bhannu, yedi teti bhanda ni nabhaye chai legal procedings ma janu parla.              he might have used force and violence, in the heat or anger, so try to communicate first, ask him what he thinks, why he thinks that to cause him to raise hand against you|||This is projection.  He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only. Either way you two are done, if you decide to keep together one of you will need to make a huge compromise.|||Seems like you don't have any children, that's a blessing in disguise.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know.

But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.

I reach to restaurant, my mother video calls me to show her the \"proof\" that I am meeting this friend. I show her the \"proof\". I am quite angry and disappointed that she doesn't trust. I reach home at around 9pm and now both my parents give me silent treatment, like they don't shout at me but give me silent treatment which I think is even worse... well I think this IS normal in nepali household I just wanted to vent",

After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.  After finally catching him up, i tried to have a normal convo with him. there were only two of us who found and caught him at that time. we were waiting for others to come. my another friend went out to bring water for him. Suddenly, he leveraged the situation to run away from me. I got injured in my head and hand  Then i tried chasing him. The only thing in my mind was, dude it took so long and effort to finally find him. He was attempting to harm himself at times. So, we couldn't let him get away.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

So I have two questions;  1. How do I make the insertion easy? Are there any tips, tricks whatsoever?   2.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason.

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity.

            "comments": "You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer. Maybe you need to level up your game.   Also, tech is passionate field. The whole reason you are being beaten down by AI already is you are here for money.  Dont get me wrong i have earned fortune from tech but if it was not for my passion, i would have been average guy with average payout in tech too.  Junai field maa ni tyo top maa huna you need passion.|||12YoE here.  IT is at its peak at the moment.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog. I also dont like Shrinkhala though.|||[deleted]|||Source-trust me bro|||Haha. I thought people saw through Baniya.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.   While I welcome reddit posts like these because it reminds people like us that each story has two sides and we need to Stop idolizing celebs/influencers, it is also important for us not to dive too much into these things and debate over 'what or who' is correct.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र).

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ? Whoever the person is hero or villain if they are given special security, it means they are important. Maybe not important to you, but important to some people. If you are important enough that people might attack you, the government provides security , please ask for one .other wise there is nothing wrong in giving way, or at least trying to do so. Your stupidity can cause serious issues for others involved, and once again, our country could be blamed internationally.",

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations. Oli had smothered our relation with India and that needs fixing too. We've seen with Ukraine what happens when populist politics and bad relation with neighbor does to a country.

If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner?

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6.

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Not only that, it would be great if we became able to create tram lines and bring trams starting from ktm, then based on this - internal, closed and nearby routes can use that line and longer travel utilize bus line.|||Someone doing government's job btw|||Salute to the creator Subham Subedhi. Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

Border control is a must.|||Will the hate between Indian and Nepali on reddit end!  Reading the other comments got me thinking  1. Being abusive only escalated things. 2. What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis. Hate the bad ones and respect the good ones, be it any human from any demographic.|||BSF is for Bang-la-desh border and not ours|||Indian sub ma haldeu spamm|||ani mug wonder why we hate them|||Where is this actually?|||And fuckin Indians will be proud of this|||Ssb|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||haina hola|||It might sting but it's the truth.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

One of the client where I used to work said his dad has a huge business and big house for office, they sell medals, trophies with custom carving and expensive compared to others but you can get anything you asked for (like design, customization and more).   And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog. I also dont like Shrinkhala though.|||[deleted]|||Source-trust me bro|||Haha. I thought people saw through Baniya. But still believing him, sympathising him 😂 you all are played!|||I once read a reddit post which claimed Aishwarya and Amitabh were in a relationship and to stay at the same place without anyone suspecting, she married to Abhishek.|||Lol. I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

Heard about it from someone close to his circle (someone from television), but could never verify.|||It interesting to see how hating on Shrinkhala has become like a cool thing and people are just like yeah  don't love her but yeah some of this is true. What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time. That speaks volume.|||Enough of this Sisan and Shrinkhala shit, kaam xaina ho timi haru ko aru? Kati samma ko berojgar ho yar|||Are you serious? Is this true?

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.   But I've heard many narratives of both of them, some on reddit, some from friends in the media etc. And again reading this post has really led me to believe that BOTH are snakes. So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.   While I welcome reddit posts like these because it reminds people like us that each story has two sides and we need to Stop idolizing celebs/influencers, it is also important for us not to dive too much into these things and debate over 'what or who' is correct.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Fake story|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

Well I researched myself and talked to doctor, it was because of this,  Because of being grown up in controlling nature, hamro nervous system chai ekdam arkai tarika ley build vaisakeko huncha. So, timle vaneu afno feeling vanna sakdina (same for me), it is cause maybe sano ma timle mamu baba athaba kasailai thorai gan gan (sano ma it's your feeling) uhaharule karaunu vayo athawa make you scared, then timroo nervous system chai it will build itself like it is danger to tell your feeling, ani at that time your system gets shut down (ani maan vari huney, ankha bata aanshu jharney huncha). Ani esto vaye pachi you go on talking with yourself ani most of the time you are talking yourself being angry and regret which will trigger depression. Timle real life ma ni notice garya holau, when you may have thought of reading, tetibela chai you will be getting out of your comfort zone to read where nervous system senses it as danger ani it will shut your system down ani procrastination huney type ko huncha. Ra man it is same for me.   ani for we boys(if you happened to be), everyone says taah rois vaney ta weak hoss, kta harule afno problem afai handle garney ho arulai sunauney haina, baru aruko kura sunney ani console garney ho. you may have heard this while growing up ani nervous system implants that . it will be like showing weakness is danger. Ani when your mind wants to tell but nervous system detects it as problem, it will shut your system down ani you will go in loop of regret and overthinking ani after that depression.   So, yoh problem even in me exists till now. If you can, go for professional help, sakdeinau vaney follow anurag\\_stunning in instagram. It is as effective for me as of getting paid therapy but in free of cost.|||I might help you",
