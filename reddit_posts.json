I’m currently abroad, but my mom and my rabbit were at home. The noise was so intense that even over the phone, I could hear it in the background. My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

He will rest in peace knowing he was so fortunate to have a brother like you.|||I am so so sorry.  Animals are the first victims of fire crackers.  I'm sorry your beautiful little bunny brother is gone.|||I am so sorry for your loss. Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||Here's a hard truth: that's on you. That's a fucking animal. He should have been running around in a forest. You brought it to human civilisation. You. So its your job to protect him from human civilisation. You should have got sound-proofing.  I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.  Saying \"firecrackers took my rabbit's life\" is like putting a child on the middle of the road and complaining that \"car took my child's life\". Should the driver have been more careful? Yes. But shouldn't the parent be accountable too?|||This was a festival meant to celebrate what we mostly ignore, nature's gifts and spiritual connections but people make it about pleasure in harmful ways. I'm very sorry for your loss. What was meant to be a heartwarming celebration, was infiltrated by these customs no one knows who started.|||I am so so sorry.  Animals are the first victims of fire crackers.  I'm sorry your beautiful little bunny brother is gone.|||Is a rabbit more important than a chicken? Is the festival cultural practice of fireworks less important than rabbits life? We have a cultural practice of slaughtering a lot of animals in the gadhimai festival. Should we condemn the festival or the slaughtering of animals or the hypocrisy of morality giving different values to chicken and rabbit and buffalo. Are we hypocrites of the highest order?",

I’m not expecting anything from anyone anymore. I just want to appreciate the people around me. Even those who’ve hurt me in the past. I don’t hold anything against them now. Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I’m focusing more on my personal growth and learning — I’ve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I’m mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed — personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I’ve finally come out the other side. I’ve realized I’ve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That’s the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn’t always mean money. Sometimes, it’s just appreciating someone’s efforts. Sometimes, it’s being there for someone who’s lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I’ve even tried helping a few people here (and if you’re one of them, don’t feel awkward). I just want to say this: there’s so much more to life than just these things. You never know who out there just needs a little push, a little light.  Dui din ko jindagi ma marera laanu k nai xa rw.

            "body": "Nepali politics change discussions very often lead to personalities rather than thoughts. This is precisely the reason why movements emerge rapidly — and fall apart just as fast.   The case of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party has been under reflection, and it turns out that it, in a subtle manner, bore something rare vaunted by its maker goodwill from and not solely a face but around values — integrity, accountability, transparency, and youth-led reform.  However, the vision was stillborn. Politics of internal factions, improper timing, and a lack of strategic leadership mired what could have been Nepal's first real proof that ethical politics could be effective. But the groundwork was made — civic education, merit-based politics, decentralization, and evidence-driven policy-making.  At present, the news of Sumana Shrestha and some of the other youth leaders getting into talks again gives me a small flicker of hope.   Parliament has been summed up by Sumana's ascendance that impact doesn't need to be loud — it needs to be clear, honest, and constant. If people like her take it upon themselves to either resurrect or reinterpret Bibeksheel Sajha's values, that could be a watershed moment.  Moreover, it is important to point out that Yujan Rajbhandari, who's the head of the Bibeksheel Sajha youth wing, continues to symbolize the movement's spirit. Such leaders reflect the values the party once represented — disciplined activism, ethical leadership, and long-lasting civic transformation.  Let’s face it — Rastriya Swatantra Party did cover up a void and rally people’s discontent, but it nearly always gives the impression of a party of egos rather than of principles. It is devoid of a profound institutional culture — the very thing that Bibeksheel Sajha always aspired to build.  Nepal doesn't want another temporary populist wave. What it necessitates is a political movement that keeps on building a sustainable one.",

Just give them healthy food it's your responsibility as a parent.

Cough syrup is only a symptomatic relief. They act by reducing the afferent part of the cough reflex and also by soothing your throat that also reduce afferents. All colds are viral and so antibiotics won't work. You have to let it play out.  Now I can agree that medicines can be scams in India and Nepal.

            "body": "I recently completed my Bachelor's in IT with Distinction and am currently working as a Web Developer earning around 45K/month. But now, I’m in a dilemma: should I pursue my Master’s in Nepal or go abroad (thinking USA or Australia)? My long term goal is to land a solid job in the IT with a good package (around 4–5 lakh/month), and build strong network.  If I stay in Nepal, I can probably manage an IT job alongside my Master's and even try applying for remote jobs abroad later on. But I fear that the Nepali masters degree in IT won't be that serious and wont open much doors for me. Whereas, if I go abroad (Targeting USA/AUS), I might be benefited with great exposure, networking, etc. But what I fear is I might not get to focus on studies and even IT altogether due to side job (Non IT) that we have to do for survival there. And I might get diverted from tech to other domain of jobs. Let me know if its not the case. What I want is to stay in IT domain.  So, what should be the best approach for my target? Are there Nepali people, who have built a good career in IT at abroad by studying there alone? Or, is it better to study here and land a better package later on? Any advice would be highly appreciated.  Fyi, like most typical Nepali families, my parents expect me to go abroad, but they’re supportive enough to agree with my decision if I know what I’m doing.",

I’m not expecting anything from anyone anymore. I just want to appreciate the people around me. Even those who’ve hurt me in the past. I don’t hold anything against them now. Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I’m focusing more on my personal growth and learning — I’ve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I’m mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful breakup about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that heartbreak hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed — personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I’ve finally come out the other side. I’ve realized I’ve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That’s the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn’t always mean money. Sometimes, it’s just appreciating someone’s efforts. Sometimes, it’s being there for someone who’s lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in heartbreak. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I’ve even tried helping a few people here (and if you’re one of them, don’t feel awkward). I just want to say this: there’s so much more to life than just relationships. You never know who out there just needs a little push, a little light.  Dui din ko jindagi ma marera laanu k nai xa rw.  Life is short, Live it fully. May God bless you!!!!!!!  (I just unlocked the eligibility to post here, so thought why not here? haha 😂)",

Just start talking to her. Be straightforward and logical.  If there's no contact, or if you're like me, one of those few \"losers\" who can’t muster the courage to be a man in front of a woman, then write a story. Create an imaginative narrative based on you and her. You can end it however you like: maybe you marry her, or maybe she remains a mystery. You can make anything happen in that story.  Once you begin writing, one of two things will happen. Either you'll feel the weight of it and eventually stop, or you'll keep going and turn it into a novel. Who knows? Maybe you’ll publish it and make money from it. In fact, this could be much more productive and better for your mind and body than sitting in longing.  If, by any chance, your love turns physical and you can’t fulfill that part, then just suffer, bro. Or find other ways to deal with it.  One piece of advice: from my experience, being single is far better than being in love. You can live 30 years of your life single, and then your family might pressure you to marry. Until then, you have your free will. Use it wisely.|||Moving is just a word for us|||Bro 9 yrs vayo..but i still love her.|||It's hard bro , arki date nagari kei lagdaina|||![gif](giphy|k24uHda5UiIgw)  Like this.|||Nisthuri mori le garnu garichhe.|||Hawa ho|||https://youtu.be/HO0svGjVEP8?si=bj-y1QdNEwYcW109|||Castration \"The Most Reliable and Efficient Way to Move on\"",

Ani yesta le laxmi puja garchan.🤦‍♀️|||Should have slapped the F out of that person|||I'm not sure of the reasons as to why older people in general are more of a F****** pervert than these youngsters. Especially when they have started their own family, and that's a point where you really learn to be selfless for the first time in your entire life. First time you would probably feel like you are living for someone else than yourselves. But I wouldn't know what it really is like since I haven't reached that point. I feel like younger perverts just don't have the courage at that point in their life to do something like that. I asked an older guy I know like mid 40s why do you stare at young girls moreso than younger guys do, I told him it's common to look at girls as we are attracted to them but we still give them some personal space to not make them feel threated by staring like a creep. He said that maybe you guys are used to watching women dressed in modern ways and are more adapted to it that it's not a problem for you if you see a women in more or less revealing ways compared to the past, to you it's normal so you don't think much of it, we weren't used to seeing women dress that way in the past. Before some moron with low English comprehension skills misunderstands, don't even try. It's an opinion as to why they do, what they do not justification. This isn't my opinion. I'm only trying to learn more as to why older guys are such perverts by sharing this and if someone has a better insight to it.|||It has nothing to do with what you were wearing.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media.

Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

The way we celebrate Dashain and Tihar, our social values, family interactions, and even food traditions, all have their own unique character in Nepal.

The difference can be seen in everything from our architecture to how we treat guests or celebrate festivals.

Over time, they blended with Magars, Gurungs, Tamangs, Tharus, Newars, Rai, Limbu  everyone. Nepal’s always been a crossroads, not one ethnicity.  Even though most of us are Hindu, our culture feels different  the way we celebrate Dashain and Tihar, our food, our family values. Historically, Nepal meant the Kathmandu Valley, the Newar homeland, while the hills were a buffer between Tibet and the plains. Our roots have always been both Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman.  I get what the OP means in a modern sense, Nepali and Indian identities are different. I studied in India, and the culture there feels more urban, loud, individualistic, while Nepal’s is quieter, collective, shaped by the mountains.  India itself is diverse Kashmiri to Tamil, Kerala Muslim to Bengali Muslim, Bihari to Rajput   all different. It’s a republic of many ethnic states the struggle for Gorkhaland in Darjeeling was just that a struggle for an ethno state.   So when people say “Indian influence,” I don’t get it. We share civilizational ties, sure but Nepal isn’t India, and India isn’t one thing either.|||Hmm I am from Uttarakhand and I could say along with Himachal Pradesh the Hilly cultures are similar but the planer ganga yamuna belt is quiet different from us as well.|||   India is diverse in the sense that you have every kind of caste and race living in the same country, but in separate states and with different languages. In Nepal, though, people live under the same roof, speak almost the same language, and nobody finds it weird  like a Gurung family living right beside a Newar family and all.  Also, in Nepal, the garbage truck comes every week, so we all go out together to throw our trash. But in India, that’s not so common. It’s kind of a Nepali national culture now  your mom screaming, “Throw the garbage! The truck’s here!” 😄|||India itself is diverse. There's no general indian. So yeah some part of India be similar to you. Not whole india cause there's no universal culture in India.|||It just shows how little you know about India.  India is one of the most diverse countries in the world.   The culture of Uttarakhand is indistinguishable from the culture of Sudurpaschim and adjacent regions.   Same goes with culture of Sikkhim, Bengal and Eastern Nepal.   Your definition of Nepal is very narrow and shows that you only think of Terai and Madesh as different while the rest of Nepal as a monolith.|||lol the differences that you are talking about can be seen from one Indian state to another, India itself does not have one common way of celebrating Dashain or Tihar, common social values, food tradition, etc. No matter how much we try to differentiate ourselves from Indians that's the most similar we are to any other country.|||Why do you think only Madesh has similar culutre to India? We all celebrate Dashain and Tihar(dfferent reason and rituals). Our family values are similar when it comes to education, marriage and relatives and elders. Our spending patterns are similar. Our language in structure are also similar. (Compare nepali to chinese or english that would be different).    India itself is a diverse country which makes it impossible to generalise it. So comparing nepal to one part of India is a statistical error. As Nepal borders with Tibet, its influence is observed in our culture and becasue Northern Nepal is hilly contrast to plains in south, lifestyle changes to adapt to it. But it is again similar to people in Uttarakhand or Northeast India.|||Depends on what part of India you are referring to? India is extremely diverse and Nepali culture - as it is - is more similar to Indian Culture than culture can be between different parts of India. Remember, the India we think of today is British India, but before that Nepal was no different than any other kingdom in the Indian subcontinent. Our festivals, rituals and customs are the same with superficial regional differences. Buddha and Sita both associated with India were Nepali. We are the same people, same broad culture just different nationalities.|||Compared to everyone else like west, China, Pakistan and stuff. Our culture is more similar. Maybe that is the reason.|||Because Nepalese copies indians and indian culture, it's that simple. Just like India people here are also brainrot.

If you were to choose one culture that we are most similar with, which one would you choose?

We are all dharmic societies. Families are similar. Food traditions are similar (daal, bhaat, tarkari is common across the subcontinent). Flavors changes but that changes even between families living 2 houses apart. Such is the diversity.  Architecture is similar. Pahadi architecture is shared across India/Nepal, Plain area architecture is also shared across both countries.  Ofcourse we are more influenced to tibetan culture compared to India as a whole. But pahadi states of India are as much influenced by tibetan culture due to close proximity.   In general Nepali are calmer than Indians. But I have found that Pahadi people of India are calmer still and south indians (had lived in Karnataka for education) are also calmer. Only hot heads were in the northern plains of India.  \\*\\*Nepal is different to India only and only due to its Nationalism\\*\\*. Kind of like Germany and Switzerland.

Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples.

Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist.

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it’s 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I’m happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He’s an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn’t benefit from it.  My father isn’t happy here  It’s been over 10 years and he’d say that if I said I wanna go back he’ll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) “Tell your father this. ‘Dad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?’ If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He’s here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him —just him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn’t want to leave his family here”  I then said “dad’s gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That’s what he said”  Grandma “he said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you’re always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn”   Me “but, I like it here”  Grandma  “Do you love your dad or not? He’s done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He’s 53 now. Come to Nepal. I’ve got money to pay for your school fees”  That’s when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it’s especially hard in the hot son as he’s an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn’t like it heere and he’s much happier everytime we’re in Nepal.  My dad did say “we should’ve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick” But I’m 23 now  And I don’t wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He’s an amazing person who’s gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say “I want to go back to Nepal” he’ll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the “power” but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here’s what she said “Your dad is 50 now. He’s been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don’t let me stop you but if I was in your place, I’d come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors”  I hate it. Also my grandma isn’t a bad person  My aunties  1 is in US 2 are in Canada  And 1 is in Nepal  So grandma lives Alone The auntie that’s in Nepal stays with her.  So Idk what to do I’ve got an Australian license. I’ve built a life here  I’m studying and don’t work atm  I’m an Australian citizen I wanna cry. I feel like I’ve failed as a daughter.",

You can be happy in Aus, he can be happy in Nep. Both of you can visit each other every so often. It's time for you to leave the nest anyways.|||No. Anyone who says \"oh your dad's done so much for you\" and tries to blackmail you is a terrible person.   Also, move to Nepal and do what? You grew up in Australia.. you're more in touch with Australia than you are with Nepal...   Its a parent's job to provide for their children... they're not doing you as a favor, that's literally their responsibility.  Maybe once he's older then sure, if you want to take care of him go ahead. But he's a fully capable man, fully capable of living on his own.   You're only 23, you should be traveling, having fun, focusing on your career.. not worrying about what people in Nepal think.|||Grandmom sounds like a manipulative person tbh hearing your replies and stuff.  Baru have an open convo with your dad with what your grandmom is saying.  Do you really think he’d want you to sacrifice your education, career, your life after he’s worked to hard all his life to provide for you?|||Your father isn’t that old. He can definitely live alone (if he doesn’t have anyone here in Nepal) for 15 years at least and you both can visit each other in the meantime.|||Looking at your replies to other comments, it seems like you have already made up your mind. Are you just here looking for validation that you are right?|||Whats wrong coming here for a while, mountains are calling anyway.|||Think about your future is what I will say.       Let's say your entire family migrates back to Nepal and you and your brother fail to have a  good future here.        Do you think your father will be happy?       He will blame himself.       So will you after some times.           Convince your dad to take long vacations in Nepal now and then.        That will help ease the homesickness.   Don't let your emotions ruin your future ahead.     |||It’s simple: J sukai gara! It doesn’t matter. There is no right or wrong options here. You are a nice daughter anyways since you are thinking for him, thinking about him. Nothing else matters. Tetai basey ni it’s good. Farkey ni it’s good. No need to listen to many people and make it complicated.|||Your dad will understand that you can make your own choices. Bela mauka ma Nepal aaunu, ani your dad can come to Australia once in a while.   Another solution is get married and have few children. Tes pachhi ta your dad and others will understand. |||If you can earn good money in Nepal, return. If you can't, just tell that to father.|||Your dad took you to Australia when you were 10 , you didn’t get to choose what you wanted. Now you are 23 and he and his family is manipulating you to move back to Nepal. Sorry girl, but you are being played like a ping pong ball here. Kaile kata kaile kata. I know you love him tara at the end of the day it is your life. If you don’t like it in Nepal you will never forgive your dad coz you will feel like he caused that misery and maybe your relationship with him will also go down hill. You need to have a proper conversation with him and let him choose. He can’t have both haath ma laddu, you plus his want to go back to Nepal. For once, be selfish and choose what you want.|||if you can afford, you can come to Nepal with your family and enjoy a vacation here but not fast paced khale. Spare some time like a month or so and enjoy a laid back life for some days. He is probably exhausted being in a foreign land. But you can have your own preferences of living here or there permanently.|||I have seen many cases like that. Send your father Nepal for few years I bet you $1000 he will be back to Australia. My friend family leave USA for good because his parents wanna go back to Nepal. They purchase land and properties and lived for 3 years in Nepal but they’re back again in US after selling their house and land.   They can’t live without their kids. And their kids basically grown up in US. They love and know US more then they know about Nepal.|||Your dad ‘sacrificed’ for you, you will ‘sacrifice’ for your kid, such is life. I am sure your dad understands this. Stop letting old people guilt trip you to do things you aren’t comfortable doing. Talk to your dad! Always remember, most of us internet strangers are stupid af, especially in this sub, so take every comment here with a grain of salt.|||honestly i haven't read half of what you have written but i will say:  We all acknowledge your father love toward his motherland. but nepal isn't so good in condition rn basic facilites are expensive and hard to get. So stay there now for the sake of your brother and when you start to earn to support your family send your parents here the facilites maybe less but the pleasure is unmatched anywhere in the world. and seeing your condition you might me a australian citizen even so visit nepal sometimes and never forget your motherland and who you are.   \\[Just some emotional and logical dialogues your father will melt thinking my daughter is matured enough to say this and stay happily.\\]   you can dm if you want any help. :)|||I'm kind of in the same situation as you, same age but male in Canada. Both of my parents are pushing 50 and want to go back to Nepal and take me with them, but I've chosen to live here and let them go back to Nepal when my little brother is grown up. The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.  Another reason for you to not go back if your gender. You have more rights and freedoms in Australia than you do in Nepal, and you might not get used to the regressive expectations that native Nepalis have for women.|||No offense, but it seems like she's engaging in some extremely manipulative behavior.   P.S. I don't know the whole story. This is just the feeling I got from reading this post. I might be completely wrong.|||You father will not want to destroy your life and career and come to Nepal. Stay there make a good living come back 10 yrs later retire early.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.|||Don’t feel anything bad about yourself. Its his decision and not yours.   Years ago he was coerced by your mom and now your grandma wants you to coerce him back to Nepal. I don’t know what it is with the ladies of your household but I think he has to make his own decision   Every parent makes  sacrifices and if you become one you will too. And what if father you go back what about your brother ? It is what it is . If he wanted to leave he should have done years ago. Complete your studies first and than think what you should do? And don’t feel guilty about anything, this situation isn’t of your making and you shouldn’t sacrifice your studies or career for this. Your father will never be able to forgive himself.|||It is hard to deal with manipulation from adult family as we get older. As children our adult family are our guides and heroes. When we grow we start to learn they are flawed people just like everyone. But learning to handle their manipulation will make you stronger. You are an adult now and allowed to make decisions about your own life and how you live it   Maybe you can find some way to help your father enjoy Australia more? Is he involved with the nepali community? Maybe he can do a hobby or a sport? Enjoy some day trips on the weekend to parks or gardens|||Don't let your dad's sacrifice go to vain. He endured to give you the opportunity, don't let it go to waste.|||Hi, I cant provide the solution. But I am an engineer and currently living in Australia. Can you ask your dad to provide job refrence to me please. That will mean alot to me. Thankyou|||Never needed to post this as your grandmother and cousin said it best but if you really want to make your happy, convince your mother to consider her husband’s happiness too as you said he’s not happy and you should complete your studies. Consult with your family about each others needs but for you tell them that you are considering to go back to Nepal temporarily but will return as even after completing studies you won’t get better job opportunities in Nepal and even then you’ll visit your family. Hope this helps",

But Israel is such a big country with the best intelligence agency in the world arguably. They can’t manage surgical strikes and have to kill poor Palestinians? Yeah not buying that. They even don’t allow UN trucks to enter Palestine. It’s a genocide. If India did that with Nepal we’d also support any entity fighting back. You don’t corner people and expect 0 retaliation. Having said that Hamas should not exist and I find it hilarious that Israel can bomb Qatar, can send spies to assassinate people but they can’t do a surgical strike on Hamas and kill all of them or send their spies to do so if they live in a different country. It’s just an excuse to exterminate Palestinians at this point.|||They’ll never criticize Hamas alone in one sentence. They’ll have to bring Israel in the discussion.

It’s increasing in population but decreasing in quality of life and peace of living.     * People spit gutka and paan everywhere.    * Public and private sector staff often act like they’re doing you a favor instead of just doing their job.    * Basic civic sense is missing.    * Many people talk in a rude way, even though Maithili itself is such a sweet language.    * Hospitality is terrible. Even in well-known restaurants, you don’t get a menu. You have to call staff multiple times, and when they finally come, they’re rude.    * Local leaders and youth behave like they own the place and can do whatever they want.    * Loud music in public transport and public spaces is normal.    * People get aggressive and start fights very quickly.    * If a policeman tries to enforce basic civic sense (like asking not to play loud music), people threaten him — “I’ll burn your police station.” * One time, Janakpur was known for quality education. Now it feels like the complete opposite. And the list goes on. Why don’t the people and leaders of Janakpur want to learn from other places? Why isn’t civic sense a priority for the local government? Why can’t people just be calm and respectful?",

But there is disagreement in the order. One believes jesus will return before the millennium are called **pre** millennials, another believes jesus will return after the millennium are called **post** millennials. Both of them want jesus to come back.  To make this happen post millennials work towards the project of this kingdom. Missionary activity is that. They are trying to take over the world, and after a thousand years of that, Jesus will come back. Which is also how Christianity was used to justify imperialism back in the day.  Pre millennials are terrifying. They want to enact this Armageddon. Which is when there is an armed conflict in the valley of Megiddo, in Israel**.** And look at whats happening in that region.  I used to think the hindu idea of every next yug getting worse is bad because it develops an apathy in people. But Christianity is impressive, their prophecies affect real world geopolitics.|||Christian here. I can’t say for all - many believe that sharing good idea with people will be worth. It’s like this is one life - so if the truth of Christianityis right then all people should hear the truth.  Now, i understand some come from weird style and approach. I get the frustuation. But the thing is many want people to know what their belief system is and this is a part of “particing their religious acts” like same as with worshipping in temple - take it as a “to do” for religious duty. Now, there are some sects of hinduism that does this. People of Iscoon - they reinterpret every portion of bhagwat geeta and then mix every religion truth into it. Ask any higher pandit who has good academics in hinduism and see how they cringe on the iscoon and harey krishna movements.

Evey religion has bad sides . I dont like christianity but Christ. Read about Christ and His sacrifice and see for yourself if He moves your heart.

I am a business owner i dont depend on anyone’s donation. I believe every soul has empty wound . Being spiritually awakened and renewed mindset through the words of Christ helps me become a better person and better decision making.

It is very clear that it commands Christians to 'share the good news' (Matthew 28:19-20) but the bible is clearly against bribery as written in Exodus 23:8. There is also a popular \"prosperity gospel\" which is a distortion of the bible and has given Christianity a bad reputation.   Onto the 'why, what benefit would the normal christians get from me converting to Christianity': The fundamental reason is that the bible says we all have sinned against God (Romans 3:23), doing the things we knew were evil. Now, compared to Hinduism which has a karma system, Christianity has a justice-grace system that is more tied to how courts work, which requires for punishment of sins/crimes and makes the sacrifice of Jesus necessary.  Thus, those who believe it to be true want to make it known to others for belief that it will save their souls.",

I’m not expecting anything from anyone anymore. I just want to appreciate the people around me. Even those who’ve hurt me in the past. I don’t hold anything against them now. Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I’m focusing more on my personal growth and learning — I’ve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I’m mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed — personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I’ve finally come out the other side. I’ve realized I’ve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That’s the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn’t always mean money. Sometimes, it’s just appreciating someone’s efforts. Sometimes, it’s being there for someone who’s lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I’ve even tried helping a few people here (and if you’re one of them, don’t feel awkward). I just want to say this: there’s so much more to life than just these things. You never know who out there just needs a little push, a little light.  Dui din ko jindagi ma marera laanu k nai xa rw.

            "body": "I get it. The Bul­let’s thump feels like personality. But turning midnight into a drum solo? That’s not character. That’s a public service announcement for insomnia.  That aftermarket “Bullet” can turn up in the evening and night isn’t heritage. It’s harassment.  Families are trying to sleep. Patients, infants, students, and night-shift workers. Your throttle isn’t their alarm clock.   Kathmandu’s valleys already echo. Add a straight pipe, and it’s basically surround-sound chaos.     Legal bit, because this isn’t just vibes:  Nepal Police and the Department of Environment have repeatedly cracked down on loud/modified exhausts and fined riders. Modifying silencers away from factory spec is illegal under Nepal’s vehicle rules, and fines have been issued under the Environment Protection Act.      What would be better:  Keep your bike stock or at least within legal noise limits.  If you must flex, do it at noon, not midnight.  Garage owners: stop selling “festival edition” pipes year-round.  Disclaimer: I ride a bike. Not an Enfield. Could this be jealousy? Maybe 2%. More likely it’s my niece’s sleep deprivation.  https://preview.redd.it/p4spyr0oz8vf1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa4fe68ffe83614e33ec1eaeeef38674068b4cf5",

Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary.

C is good for low level programming, and also one good language where you dont need to scratch your head more. 2. Write code to your maths assignment. Not only math, but other subject like graphics or anything that needs numbers|||I see people recommending beginners start with low level languages. Honestly, that's only realistic if you have insane discipline. Those suggesting it are forgetting what it's like to be a complete beginner, they're just projecting their current knowledge onto you.  In a world full of distraction like now, starting with something boring takes extraordinary discipline and I wouldn't trust myself with that.  Start with high level languages instead, especially something visual like web development. Learn html, css, js,  you'll actually see what you're building, which is much more fun.  Once you've got the basics down, set up a proper dev environment. Your desk, theme, and editor actually matter. There are phases where coding gets boring sometimes and having a setup you love makes it easier to show up. When you need a break, customize your theme or tweak your workspace. Then jump back into coding. Repeat this cycle forever.|||would have done Law instead.|||First year: Take C programming very seriously, learn web basics like html,css,js Second year: Do leetcode exercises while studying DSA so that I actually get what I study, learn FE frameworks basics like React. Start learning BE technologies  Third Year: focus on web development more. Start learning AI and its applications Fourth Year: Complete focus on AI.|||Farming.|||PYTHON WITH FOCUS ON DATA ANALYST ROLES|||Try to do intership as soon as possible|||I would not recommend  cs  in the first place.   If i had too start a tech journey, probably  1. Become good/decent in one language(python/javascript), no c,c++,go,rust 2. learn a backend framework and learn to do basic crud stuff, use database 3. learn frontend and become full stack or  learn linux, web server, basic deployment stuffs and choose the path of cracked backend developer with stacking devops stuffs. 4. Learn cloud, containerization, application monitoring.  Btw, if you are disciplined enough, don't waste 4 yrs of cs,    you can learn the above stuffs in around 1.5-2yrs if you push yourself reguraly,   you probably won't be able to follow through all the stuffs i've mentioned due to time/energy constraint while doing cs stuff. 80-90% cs stuff is absolute bullshit(outdated, non-marketable, non-comprehensible, trivial), you'll regret joining cs after couple of years,   bookmark this comment.|||There is no perfect roadmap  Explore gara.

Never copy anything blindly, understand what you copied. 3. Never use gen ai agents in Agent mode, use ask mode and ask as many questions as possible   4. Avoid shits like bootstrap, focus on writing some vanilla CSS on web dev stage 5. Don't rush to get a job, first grasp fundamental concepts well 6. Don't do overly complicated stuff, you will be ambitious and break all rules above. |||Math and then ML.     Get mad good with Linear Algebra and Statistics. Then proceed to ML with some Python programming.|||I saw many comments with their take on starting with low level programming, and some argue against it. But I think it really depends on what programming means to you. If you feel cs is just writing code in a company or making aandha paisa, then definitely you should learn those things that will land you a job faster, and a high level is the best way there. But if you are a person who loves to scratch things and is very enthusiastic about this domain, and you like to explore more, then I would suggest going with low level ( i.e., C programming). I also saw someone saying C feels boring, but that's not the case if you are actually interested and want to learn, not for the sake of others or to find a job, but because you want to have strong fundamentals in computer science. I learned C as my first programming language, and I didn't learn it in school; I didn't learn the way that schools teach C. If you learn the way school teaches, then it's definitely boring, and you never get to know how deep yet simple the language is, and how fun it can be. The most interesting and fun days of my programming career were those when I was doing low level programming. I am not saying you can't have fun solving problems in high-level languages, but i feel when you move towards the corporate world or you do something you love as a career/work for others, then I don't think it still sparks in your face. I am not saying you can't enjoy it, many people do actually enjoy it very much, but I find it draining, and THAT'S A PERSONAL VIEW|||First of all, what is your goal? Cs can be broad.   My suggestion is just as I would have done it if I could go back in the past. My main focus would be to clarify my goal and work my way up from there. Since I read your other comments and I am assuming that you want to be a developer and you are completely fresh:  1. My first priority would be to understand the database. This is where it all starts and ends. If you understand the in and out of database you will have an easier time developing a software.  2. I would study every major aspect of OOP + file handling. My go to language would be C/C++. No need to worry about which one to choose. You're less likely to use it in your development career unless you're a software engineer or a game developer.  3. I would learn javascript and css by heart. I would not listen to anyone saying otherwise. This has been a lifesaver for me for more than I can count my fingers in my hands. 4. As soon as I understand OOP, I would jump into studying python  (you can choose your own backend coding).  5. Finally, I would start with my small full stack project. My focus would be on how to connect the database to the business logic. (For example a personal finance tracker, music tracker, all in one basic tool I keep searching for online otherwise etc.) In this process I would study the logic, crud, api (ajax, hook etc), token, session, cookies etc.  6. Create a fine documentation of all the steps I took to create my personal project including mistakes and solutions.  7. A proper manual of my software. (Start now because you will need to be best at it if you want to market your software later in your life.) 8. I would keep in my mind that there are best of the best out there and keep my ego in check. Go back to basics as many times as I require. I wouldn't look down on others or stop learning from them. 7. Last but not the least, I would take care of my health. Especially my brain, back and eyes. If you want to become smart, you need to learn to give yourself a break.   I can't go into more details here but I hope it helps. Happy learning and best of luck!  Edit: git! Forgot to add it. Study from early on.|||Lean AI & ML.

Here’s where it gets worse:   I contacted customer care, and they told me to wait 24 hours for the balance to be updated. Even after 2 days, nothing happened. After following up again, they finally asked for my bank statement and transaction details. Only then was the missing amount credited to my eSewa account.  Now imagine someone in an emergency tries to load money, and the first attempt fails, but the amount is deducted. Naturally, they try again. The second attempt works, and the money is credited. But the first deducted amount remains unaccounted for unless the user remembers and takes the time to go through the whole complaint process.  This is unacceptable.

            "body": "I recently completed my Bachelor's in IT with Distinction and am currently working as a Web Developer earning around 45K/month. But now, I’m in a dilemma: should I pursue my Master’s in Nepal or go abroad (thinking USA or Australia)? My long term goal is to land a solid job in the IT with a good package (around 4–5 lakh/month), and build strong network.  If I stay in Nepal, I can probably manage an IT job alongside my Master's and even try applying for remote jobs abroad later on. But I fear that the Nepali masters degree in IT won't be that serious and wont open much doors for me. Whereas, if I go abroad (Targeting USA/AUS), I might be benefited with great exposure, networking, etc. But what I fear is I might not get to focus on studies and even IT altogether due to side job (Non IT) that we have to do for survival there. And I might get diverted from tech to other domain of jobs. Let me know if its not the case. What I want is to stay in IT domain.  So, what should be the best approach for my target? Are there Nepali people, who have built a good career in IT at abroad by studying there alone? Or, is it better to study here and land a better package later on? Any advice would be highly appreciated.  Fyi, like most typical Nepali families, my parents expect me to go abroad, but they’re supportive enough to agree with my decision if I know what I’m doing.",

            "body": "Hey everyone,   I’m a university student currently doing my mid-bachelor’s, and I’ve been trying out a few side projects as a content creator and web developer. I managed to grow an Instagram page in the entertainment and infotainment niche to over 55K followers, and even built a small SaaS website for my audience. I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.  As a content creator, I don’t think I wasted my time at all. I got hands-on experience with Canva, video editing, and engaging with my audience. I even collaborated with an app (though I didn’t get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work. Later, I built and deployed a subscription-based website but never launched it because I doubted if anyone would actually pay for it.  I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn’t go as expected. None of my 25–30 posts or reels even crossed 100 views, and more than half got copyright claims. It was a bit frustrating, especially since I was used to getting 8–53 million monthly views on Instagram.  Now I’m just looking for a job where I can use the skills I’ve learned: content creation, photo and video editing, Canva, social media growth, content strategy, and web development. I’ve learned how to understand audience behavior, spot trends early, and manage online communities, and I’m excited to bring all that experience into a real job.",

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋 — I’ve been building a React-based technical blog hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and ran into a big issue:  Currently its hosted using github pages with a custom domain, if i plan to scale this and add a backend server what advice would you give, i need it for seo and potentially placing ads.  Yes this is ai generated for proper english and summarization.     Google **discovered** my pages but **wouldn’t index** them. After some digging, here’s what I found and how I fixed it.    # 💥 The Problems  1. **404s on deep links** – `/blog/post` returns 404 because GitHub Pages only serves static files. 2. **Empty HTML for crawlers** – SPA loads `<div id=\"root\"></div>` first, no content. 3. **Bad meta tags** – my build still used `localhost` URLs.  # 🧩 My Solution  Couldn’t use `react-snap` (React 19 issues), so I wrote a custom pre-rendering pipeline.  **Stack:** React 19 + Vite 7 + Puppeteer 24 + GitHub Pages  **Key steps**  * **404.html redirect hack:** custom file that redirects `/blog/post` → `/?redirect=/blog/post`, React then restores the route with `history.replaceState`. * **Puppeteer pre-rendering:** after build, launches a headless browser, visits each route, waits for render, saves full HTML to `dist/blog/{slug}/index.html`. * **Auto sitemap:** built from my blog data array.  **Build pipeline:**      npm run deploy     → vite build     → puppeteer pre-render (13 routes ≈30 s)     → generate sitemap     → gh-pages -d dist       # ✅ Results  * Every page now has full HTML before hydration * Google shows “Page can be indexed” * Deep links work (no 404s) * Correct canonical + OG tags * 13 routes built in \\~30 s  # 🔍 What I’m Asking  1. **Scaling:** Pre-render is sequential (2–3 s / route). Ideas for parallel or incremental builds? 2. **Content storage:** Posts currently in one JS array — split JSON per post or use a CMS? 3. **Approach:** Is Puppeteer pre-rendering worth it vs moving to Next.js / Remix? 4. **SEO:** What else should I add beyond sitemap + OG + canonical + JSON-LD?",

Like literally from washing puja utensils to cleaning every corner of the house, from preparing ten different types of rotis to waking up early to cook and serve everyone it’s always the women.  And just look around during these times. The father figure, the uncle, even your brother  what are they doing except sitting, eating, chatting, or “supervising”?  Some of you might say, “hamro maa tah ma ni kaam garxu despite being a male.” But please look deeper. Are you really doing it equally? Be honest to yourself.  As I’m growing older and observing these festivals more closely, it just hits me women are doing unpaid labor in the name of culture, love, and duty. And marriage? It just institutionalizes that inequality.  The more I see it, the more I realize marriage is a scam that women are taught to celebrate.",

I can do everything at home even when I’m on my period with no restrictions, but that doesn’t mean I go around saying chhaupadi pratha doesn’t exist.  My brother washes dishes at home and does everything I do. We were raised to split things equally, no gender roles involved. But the moment we go to our relative's place, he can literally wash his hands in his plate and walk away, and no one bats an eye. If I don’t instantly grab my plate and start washing dishes, people start saying “chhori lai sanskar nadeko.”  It’s wild how deep rooted it is once you start noticing the little things. I don’t take it personally anymore, but it’s still laughable when someone says “women have equal rights now” yeah, only on paper.|||Trueeee.

It’s not about hating marriage it’s about calling out unpaid labor disguised as tradition. Until equality starts at home, culture is just convenient for men.|||*labour playing*  The world runs on women's unpaid labour. We women have grown up seeing our mom, grandmother do endless domestic, emotional labour---all normalized, all unknowledged. Unpaid Labour has been institutionalized in ways that exploit women in the name of love, duty and family. Our mothers really deserved better. And yes marriage is a scam for women. I call marriage a sexist propaganda. And ofc, not all marriages are oppressive today, but the institutional structure and history of marriage remains deeply patriarchal.|||It is not only in Nepal. Even in the developed country Like Germany is similar. I live here and know few German families. No male in those families baked during Christmas and Easter.

The demand is at its peak at these times from wives and children. Designer bag, expensive shoes and clothes, jewellery, gifts, dakchina, among other stuff that almost feels unnecessary. Now don't come at me saying, \"it doesn't happen in my family\". Sure some families may be an exception (my own is an exception but then my home also divides work before major events to keep it manageable) but I have yet to see such  other families where women put the money upfront for anything required for home, especially the expensive ones before complaining about their work they have to put into their own home for their own family. Men this men that, fuck men, plan the workloads beforehand if you can and if you can't then divorce or something. You have enough choices in this time and age. Whine less do more.

One advice that always resounded to me by a friend was \"So you think life's unfair? There's people that haven't been a kilometer within to a chau chau wrapper. So next time you resort to it, learn to put your head down, and look for that light in the end of the tunnel\". I'm afraid I'm in no position to type in devnagiri, but it sounded even more rousing in Nepali.  Your mileage may vary. But acknowledging you have a chance to make something out of yourself is concrete, palpable, and actionable.  Make no mistake, I hate mincing words: when depressed, remember all the lives that are designated to a mere existence, not the ones that thrive. It'll remind you to be motivated enough to put yourself out of that circumstance.  Here's an advice: Get to a point where you're able to self sustain. Sure, the few years are going to suck, but you'll be happier. Move out of there asap.|||There are people who actually read it all. Leave it be such comments. Rant here often and vent it out , take advice  If it's the environment that's toxic to you , you have no option but to have acceptance of it being such and then changing the very environment is the only way you can thrive again in life .  You have to find the way out . Make the change . Be determined.  The darkness and spiral of depressive mind will try to bring things down but you have to be stronger than that. There is no other way .

Survive or get lost.|||![gif](giphy|l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS)|||I think a lot of this is accurate to a degree depending on the circumstances of each situation.   For example, men can absolutely have boundaries but some men are absolutely controlling about what their women wear, hang out with, do etc.  Am I saying all men? Absolutely not.  Am I saying women can't be controlling or crazy? Absolutely not.   Bottom line, both men and women are capable of being manipulative, predatory, and crazy.   So while I agree with some of this, I will say it has very little context in each situation as all situations are different.|||no because when women say “we want older men” they mean 3-8 years older, as men tend to be immature. Men say things like “after 25 women lose value.”   women don’t date broke men because they have kids, can’t work and need someone to support them. You need money to live. Men don’t date single mothers because they don’t want to raise someone else’s child. This is a stupid comparison anyway, because you can earn money but cant get rid of your kids + women date ‘single fathers’ all the time.   Women want dominant as in ‘someone who can look after me’. Men want submissive as in ‘someone who does everything for me’|||Wanting someone younger is okey unless you are going for minor either you are a guy or a lady. Nepal ma heri ta men(older) woman(young) is normalized, astinai ko le ho yei sub ma rakheko thiyo about one of her 18yo cousin getting married to divorced uncle in his 40s with 1 son. Unfortunately pedophilia has been normalized in this society|||Seems reasonable.|||There's line between being woke and being stupid but what we supposed to do?  like a wise man said \" if 🥷's weren't so thirsty a lot of these b*tches would realize they ugly\"|||It is what it is|||its more to do with the society that has already set women beneath a certain standard. Men already have a lot of advantages in this patriarchal world and statistics show how men have used this advantage for crimes. This is why women having to set boundary is for their own protection and all the standards women have set is for basic safety and a good life .|||Society has always been judgemental! Both to men and women. Regarding calling men predator, its mostly said in a situation where a really old man goes after teenage girls. Tyo ta illegal nai ho.

And the thing about him using the media is like saying momo ma keema hunxa , obviously sab politicians haru le use garxan .  He didn't lead the protest neither told gen-z to protest, gen-z randomly started asking him to join and they also wanted him to be a pm when he never said he wanted to be one . These are all the expectations and burdens which he didn't choose but were forced upon him.  He said he was going to be a good mayor and he is , if he was in a big influencing position then the expectations would have been valid .

            "comments": "No. The reforestation campaign in Nepal has been really exemplary. The concept of Community Forests has been modal and it has had a massive impact on the  green coverage. The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

And yet the old generation say that ‘sabai forest fadisakyo’ or say ‘paila kati hariyali thiyo’. However I’d say it needs more effort and forest fire is a serious issue.|||Here's an in-depth international piece on it from NZ's Māori television:   https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/04/22/re-greening-a-country-the-story-of-nepals-community-forests/|||Kehi Haina aajkal maanxe haru hills xodera flat Tira migration vaye, gas maa reliant vaye , Gai goru, bhaisi paalna xode.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal.

Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It’s really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.

Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.

I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I’m very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It’s up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I’d also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don’t like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I’m going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue.

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we’ve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don’t reckon like that at all. From my point of view – and from any fair-dinkum Aussie – you’re more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.

It’s a norm to see this kinda stuff happening in the West.|||welcome to the uk|||Dude you think a racist person is going to know that a brown guy wearing a Dhaka Topi is Nepali and not Indian???|||It’s abt the color of our skin not the nationality with them.|||Stay safe! Life abroad has been tougher than ever before!  Nepal might be calling all! But let's hope until we return, things get straightened up back home! 🇳🇵|||It's not about the way you look, I look a bit more east asian and people have told me to \"Go back to my country\".   These people just want someone to hate, their life is probably miserable if they have to live like that. You can't do nothing about that. Just go on about your life and live the best life for yourself.|||By the looks of things, it's going to get sooo much worse.   Stagnant economy + shit leaders =  Blame the foreigners: Tale as old as time.|||Not a good time to be in the west. The decline is in full force. Economically and culturally. If you understand how whites operate you know why they are actually scared. Birth rates below replacement is a huge issue for them. It’s understandable they don’t want to be a minority in their own country and due to this racism is bound to be mainstream. I guess Karma waited some few hundred years to give them back a taste of their own medicine.   It’s time to build Nepal. I’m in the US and strongly considering moving back. You will never be a Brit to a native Brit. You will never be American to the whiltes in America.   The rise of Nepal and the eastern civilization will be glorious.|||As a white dude, I can't stand when this happens. That said, avoid dangerous people, and don't be afraid to yell for help in English if needed.

There are some spectacular idiots, and they will spout stupid things at you. When I was young anyone 'brown' was called a Paki (it makes me shudder just to type that), believe me the people shouting it had literally no idea of different south Asian countries, and wouldn't have cared even if you tried to correct them. (I was once walking with a friend who was half Iranian, so had the crime of black hair, and someone drove past yelling at us about Paki go home). It's nothing like as bad as it was 30 years ago, but still sucks to be on the receiving end of it. You can only ignore I, though my husband's technique in super white country pub places was to get in with the ghurka talk quickly (even though we're in no one way a gurkha family). The old dudes love that stuff!|||here are few things I would like to share with fellow countryman.   most of bahun/ chetri look (including me) look Indian ... so sometimes face racism due to appearance.   Most of times Indian (south asians) face racism is due to...   1. bad dressing up sense , fashion.  2. manners   3. smell     Always dress well, wear clean, not necessarily new, clothes, be polite in train, bus ( say thank you to driver, leave seats for women , pregnant, elderly etc ), don't play music in phone without earphones, don't speak in phone in crowded space, hold door if you can, and use thank you, sorry, excuse me please as often as you can. And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.      Chinese, Korean look same as Japanese , but Japanese never face racism (mostly) , it is because they are so conscious about their appearance in public, their mannerism and they are so well dressed, we must be like Japanese ;)|||Dhaka topi lagayera k hunxa ra ?

If it's just verbal, then just curse that khaire in nepali and move on.|||Either we are Indian or Mexican in a foreign country, Lmao!|||Lived in Aus for few years.Best solution is to ignore them.If its too harsh or offensive its ok to be sad.Do you think an educated and civilised person will ever call each other in terms of race or any ethnics background? You are already better than any uneducated inbred fool so its ok just don’t think too much.|||bro thinks brits who hate indians aren't also gonna hate nepalis|||Same as with Madhesi when they are in Nepal.

You can't escape it. Try not to respond, unless an attack. Then call police|||Hey I'm from UK it's all crazy at the mo don't listen to a word of it, people are being brainwashed that 'immigrants' are the problem. The intelligent ones know we need you ❤️ sorry you've experienced this but know it's just ignorance, the same people probably never even heard of Nepal 😂|||American here, apologizing for well….🤷‍♂️everything.|||I think it is pretty reasonable for him to say that because we all know there are many Indians there so does the UK government but they don't take action and people are fed up with their government and all the mindless immigrants, I mean if that many Indians were in Nepal taking our jobs you would have the same reaction. So don't prove that you aren't Indian instead finish the course you are taking or any job and come back home You can't find your home in others' homes|||So stop ruining their country, do not go to foreign countries as a restaurant worker.|||Brandish a Kahukuri around & that’ll shut em up….jk Just put a khururi cross lapel on your jumper|||As someone in USA, many times people tell me the stuffs like curry, do not redeem.

So Nepal population is low for the region but Almost 40%water in the ganges basin also comes from Nepal. This basin supports 600million people. Which is more than the population of south America.

History shows that the European contact vanished your almost 80% of the population due to the disease like Smallpox and measles and your population could not ever recover again unlike here in Nepal where we did not had any epidemic of such level which would wipe out almost 4/5th of the country's population.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don’t look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are. Nepal's population comes from the region similar to them. I have no clue why peru has low population, maybe there isn't most habitable land. Like how russia is so massive but its population is low |||If you know Peru, it's almost all mountainous terrain like a huge chunk of it is the Andes, and another chunk of it is the Amazon, with the rest being deserts where most people live.  Absolute extremes. The terrain absolutely messes things up.  Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ²|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

Such changes takes ages and generations. Look at the current US, Europe and other top civilized countries...they are no different either.   While they all are no different, at least the karyakarta of these 'NEW' forces had the audacity of breaking out of the chains of Major political parties and confront them, which was almost IMPOSSIBLE before the era of Ujjwal Thapa/Balen.   2.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing.

I use both NTC and Ncell, I have expiry date of 2027 on NTC and of 2026 August on Ncell.   Edit: Downvoted for saying the truth.|||What you can do is recharge your sim.

Right after my final semester exams, I lost my job and haven’t been able to land another job or freelance project since.

The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge. I am engaged in poultry currently and my company does have cold chain system so I know how it works (specifically for chicken) and the model is very rewarding.|||I feel your pain of not being able to find a job right now. Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails.

It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.

So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming “pay after getting the product in your own email”).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > “Scam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.”   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine — said “no need to pay before getting access,” and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies — nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he’s “sorting it out for all clients ,” but after that — no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.  I’ve attached screenshots below — just sharing this as a lesson for everyone. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.  Stay safe guys 🙏",

            "body": "I need to vent and warn others about IMS Group's incredibly unethical hiring process, specifically for digital marketing roles. This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I’m not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US. Cold emails and reach would be the way to go 4. Research countries where Big Tech will sponsor software engineers and bring them there. There’s big tech hubs in Poland, Amsterdam, Singapore and more. Research if the tech companies there also sponsor talent from abroad.|||I know a bunch who came directly from Nepal. The companies in EU don't differentiate based on where you're from.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean.

I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

Aru bank ko ma dekhayena, nic ma dekhayo|||No worries, I’ve already tested this, nothing is sent to the backend. It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it’s not. They likely initialize and tear down the camera process in the background to speed up access.|||SBL does that too|||Samsung OneUI 7.0 ma ni xina hai yo problem, maybe device specific ho ki.|||They keep logs for the fraud detection, yes almost all the banking systems keep the camera logs while logging in to the account.|||aru ma no yasto hunxa camera ko permission on bhayara ho|||Same thing used to happen in kumari and prime bank mobile app, I noticed as I used to turn off camera from the software so any app that needs camera would ask first, but for some reason as soon as I logged in those 2 apps asked to open camera and mic settings, but as of recently it seems to be fixed|||Your account might be hacked!!many of peoples' don't know shit..which is why iphone is too good for protection of ur account..if yu using Android then for sure you are on watch..

That’s a good initiative however I was just wondering though, what’s the main reason for building a new platform for this? There are open-source tools like MediaWiki that could be used for something similar. Do you feel it’s important that this is built in Nepal or with a particular tech stack? From my perspective, the bigger challenge seems to be focusing on the content and, more importantly, ensuring the accuracy of that information.|||Good job. Much needed initiative!",

In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   दफा ३७: चार्डपर्व खर्च पाउने  ३७(१): आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति तथा परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने चाडपर्वको लागि प्रत्येक श्रमिकले खाईपाई आएको एक महिनाको आधारभूत पारिश्रमिक बराबरको रकम प्रत्येक वर्ष चाडपर्व खर्चको रूपमा पाउनेछ ।  ३७(२): उपदफा (१) बमोजिमको चाडपर्व खर्च श्रमिकले एक आर्थिक वर्षमा एकपटक आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति, परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने मुख्य चाडपर्वको अवसरमा भुक्तानी लिन रोजगारदाता समक्ष लिखित अनुरोध गर्न सक्नेछ । त्यस्तो अनुरोध नगरेको अवस्थामा प्रत्येक वर्षको बडादशैंमा चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिनु पर्नेछ ।  ३७(३): चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिइने दिनसम्ममा एक वर्ष सेवा अवधि पूरा नभएको श्रमिकले निजले गरेको सेवा अवधिको अनुपातमा चाडपर्व खर्च पाउनेछ ।|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven’t completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||It's not a bonus, it's an allowance. Bonus is dependent on company performance, allowance is not. All employees are entitled to the festival allowance. It's not specific to just Dashain and not even called Dashain allowance. If you are not a Hindu or do not celebrate Dashain you can ask the company to provide you the allowance at other times of the year.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha.

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this).

Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through 🩸. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it.

If you’ve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you’ll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  · A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. · The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). · For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  · The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. · Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  · Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. · Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. · Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. · Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn’t everyone forced and fed their parent’s beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse?

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly.

I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended. So please watch podcasts of ex kumaris. Btw I'm not Newar. I'm not from valley either.

To those insisting Kumaris are always “grateful” or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We’ve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it’s what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it’s not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she’s missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let’s be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there’s more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we’re talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around “bahun,” “Christian,” or “other cultures” like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we’re not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture.

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let’s be real: he’s the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus — with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what “stable democracy” exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India’s backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra’s Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let’s talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we’d have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage — Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about “democracy dying in 1960.” These same historians never admit that the so-called “democrats” of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It’s easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here’s the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king — a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don’t lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It’s less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs’ heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It’s easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra’s reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here’s why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal’s first elected government (1959–1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn’t long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala’s government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king’s absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal’s sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren’t “ready” for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king’s will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   📌 Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There’s no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either.

This also coincidentally occurred around the time F1 decided to move its office to Pulchowk, adjacent to M&S Tower, which is basically Sirohiya's Den. It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control. Let's ask ourselves, who benefits the most from this control? Who was suffering from not having control?   Media? Politicians? Oligarchs?   To everyone wondering about the extent of the control. Never forget how soon videos started to vanish from TikTok during and after the protest.   This is what this entire fiasco was all about. A plot, put in place to achieve total control to serve Mission 2084.  The elections might have been scheduled for 2084, but the election campaigns would have launched months ahead. Imagine them having total control of social media going into 2084?   Even though we've ridiculed them for being 8th standard, they had an ambition- that is total control under the cloak of democracy. The creation of a deep state that benefits those with power by controlling the poor.|||Why are all the narcissists in high up positions|||Just to let you know, he's also the co-founder of f1soft which owns various products like esewa, fonepay, and has made banking app for several banks and so much more.|||Yesle tah airport ko tyo immigration system ma ni international software use garna parney thau ma aafno ghusaunu khojeko ki k vanera yesko vid dekheko thiye many months ago|||Good work  Does he also run the UML cyber cell which is headed by Bishnu Rimal and Surya Thapa?

Shramdan is voluntary basis, he is not commanding you to wake your ass off everyday and go to work. Plus it's a weekly thing, people who think they can help contributing to the city go on a voluntary basis. And, not all the projects are carried out using shramdan, projects that require technical expertise are obviously given to companies. I know he is an arrogant son a bitch and not competent enough to come out to executive national posts. But on the local level, we cannot deny the fact he has done substantial work.

Most probably of balen or old political parties. Mr. Sampang has done a lot of good things and  there are still a lot of things that remain for him to do. He is not a conventional leader with sweet tounge . Dude is cocky as hell and always spits harsh words. But nobody even his haters can deny his love for the nation. Even I don't like him and criticize him all the time because of how critical and straight forward he keeps himself all the time. It's idiotic. But the criticism is more of a constructive one to keep him in check. But these jholeys with all sorts of anonymous names claiming to be dharanis have similar patterns. They are completely dismissive of sampang. So it's not difficult to know that they are politically motivated. And about shram daan, if this jhole knows anything about how Singapore and china built their nation initially he wouldn't be talking about all this crap.|||Yo political kura gare jasto lagyo,gareko sabai kuralai normalize garne,tmi dharan kai bhaye pani kewal shramdaan lai maatra nahera ta tyo baheka aru pani gareka xan.kehi garekai xaina jasto banaune prayas ho ra?|||Sabai le afno afno area ma sudhar gare vai halyo.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel’s crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining “context” over our dead.

I don’t get it why do we have to hate everything? Let people do whatever they want. If you don’t like it, then don’t do it.   They’re not doing anything illegal. This is a democratic country where everyone has the right to choose and the brain to decide what they want or don’t want to do.   Who made you the pioneer or the calculator of Nepal’s culture deciding what is and what isn’t? By that logic, we should throw away all mobile phones and stop using the internet because we didn’t create them ourselves, they’re imports so are they not our culture? Should we just wear old traditional clothes, grow rice, eat, and live “peacefully” in the name of culture like old time?  Why can’t you all just let individuals be happy if they’re not hurting anyone?

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‘real’ identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba. That selective outrage is nothing but hypocrisy.|||I don’t think it’s a problem at all. You need to be inclusive to all religions and culture.

Don’t get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that’s why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one’s own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today’s world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

There is culture and traditions that should be preserved and modernized and there are things that needs reform right away.|||Our species evolved from prior species of primates, spread and settled all over the world, and where we settled,  built intersecting layers of cultures, languages, traditions, superstitions, arts, architectures, religions, gods, etc.  Using logic, reason, and critical thinking to examine these existing traditions, keeping the ones that are sensible and throwing out the illogical ones is not Eastern, Western, Middle Eastern, Asian, African or European. It's just logic.  We can enjoy and celebrate our cultural practices, examine them, and update them.    Our ancestors not only created new traditions but also stopped the ones they didn't like. We can do the same.|||It is important to think about culture and traditions critically. Eg: Sati pratha was perpetuated in the name of culture, but it IS abuse. Not everyone who criticizes traditions are westernized. That is gross oversimplification that prevents healthy discourse.   As for shivling, the whole world is obsessed with phallic structures.

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity. It's better that Chettri shouldn't be inferring in Gurung's culture and lifestyle. SImilarl, Limbu shouldn't be talking and critiquing Bahuns way of doing things.

Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea. I haven't seen it being criticized or ridiculed by anyone else from international communities.  >We are debating in Western language, wearing Western dress, using Western devices, and posting on Western platforms. Naturally these spaces are full of hate against Nepali culture, because the ecosystem itself is designed to amplify Western values while mocking our own.  How ironic! You could have at least posted this in Nepali then. I don't think most people's goal is to mock our culture, it's more of constructive criticism, at least, from my point of view. Well I do have criticism about lots of aspects of many western cultures as well. But if I make a post or comment pertaining to that then lots of people like you would probably just accuse me of emphasizing western culture too much. I criticize Nepali culture and tradition because I grew up on them and I know them well and it's part of my lifestyle as well. My philosophy is, criticize the part of things you love but find problematic, don't just accept them as they are.|||Not every but u need to understand some of them trully are , Its good to follow tradition but with time we also should improvise , child abuse is a thing people need to consider seriously , I am not only talking about Kumari pratha , also putting children in dungeons during menstrual cycle should be taken seriously.

People use this occasion to abuse substance. But thats not only the way people celebrate it.  So its not problematic.   Dashain: If you are slaughtering animals in the name of GOD or just for fun thats abuse. People all over the world eat meat.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. 😭😭2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye 😭|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
