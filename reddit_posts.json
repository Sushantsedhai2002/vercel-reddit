Back in December 2024, I kick-started my career as a mobile application intern. During that time, the CEO blamed me for negative reviews on the Google Play Store. Those reviews were related to a feature that I had never implemented, nor was I ever asked to fix. The CEO repeatedly blamed me and expected an intern to take ownership of the entire application. Apart from that, employees at the company never received public holidays—even during Holi, the CEO did not grant a holiday. Office hours were from 10 AM to 5 PM, six days a week, yet we were still expected to work after 5 PM. There was no proper guidance provided to interns, but the CEO expected intern-level employees to perform at the level of senior software engineers.|||Toxic workplace jaha ni hunxa !

Instead of red flags, I can tell you what made them great managers.   No. 1 ta micromanage nagarne nai ho. Arko chai supportive culture ho, meaning they are always looking out for your well-being and becoming patient towards juniors. Mistakes teach you lessons, tara toxic culture ma mistakes are discouraged entirely. You should also not be afraid to share ideas and vision with your manager. When there is fear, there are limited learning opportunities and it ultimately shows in your mental health.|||Ma ta jata gayo sab mero against ma morchabandi garera malai eklai parera sab milera mero kura katdai basxan.

Also managers who say “we’re like a family” but shut down feedback or punish boundaries. Learned that the hard way!|||Heres my story.   I worked in an American Company. I had initially worked in a department  that handles projects. Then I switched to another department seeking growth.  I served in the department for a year. Then the Head of our function decided they wanted to switch departments. When they moved the business deemed our function redundant and moved our team to completely random teams. (Red Flag 1)   I was placed into a function which I had no idea about. It was not my strength, and I had asked countless times to move me. Additionally my manager was a person who was not understanding at all. They had developed a role that was well above my current grade. When I confronted them about it, they just said we'll see. (Red Flag 2)  My manager then began to criticize everything I did. They began to complain about everything. From my working hours to the way I completed work. When I reported a problem, after proactively checking in with the respective stakeholders, my manager's response was to criticize me because I did not report this problem earlier. I like to automate things, she criticized me claiming  I was lazy and I looked to automate everything. (Red Flag 3)   Regardless of these situations, I decided to persevere and keep on working. Unfortunately I got really sick with Migraines. I sent my manager photos of my thermometer and the doctors note. They approved my leave without any fuss which was kinda suspicious.   When I joined work back on Monday. My manager was awfully chill about everything. They wanted to schedule a meeting with me. Being naive i didn't think too much of it but I could see that HR and Finance Managers were also in the meeting. I understood what was about to happen. I joined the meeting and got laid off.   TLDR: The workplace was trying to get rid of me, and avoid paying severance by placing me with an awful manager. However, I persevered and played along and got some severance in the end.",

I think that after a long peiod of time we have a chance to change the political and social system of Nepal, but we might repeat the same mistake that we made in the past. I think in the current scenario,  1) For FPTP, voting a right person is more important than voting the party you support. We should know exactly who are the candidates what are their ideas, qualifications and what they bring to the table rather than the party they are from. We should teach this to our parents too. Just because someone is from UML, RSP, NC, or any party you like, you don't need to vote him/her. Be reasonable, not gullible. Basically, हाम्रो होइन, राम्रोलाई भोट गरौं |  2) For PR, you should know the ideologies of the party. Are they good enough to be the ruling party(सत्तापक्ष). Not just that it is a better time to realise that it's not just who is governing that counts but also who is in the opposition (प्रतिपक्ष) counts.   There is also a downside to this idea. There might be no clear majority to form the government. But, if the MPs are qualified then coalition government will do the job, and opposition will also have qualified MPs  Lets make our vote count.    Lets vote for change.  Comment your thoughts below",

            "body": "A girl named Tirings asked me to write about grief, guilt, and goodbye. So I write. Not for her, but for the nod.  The last question I asked my father was the cruelest one. In that room smelling of antiseptic and ending, with the machine breathing for him, I leaned close. I asked the unaskable. Do you want to live or do you want to die? The sadness was a slow poison in us both. He looked at me. He nodded: No.  But his eyes—his eyes, which had not learned to lie in fifty years of hardship—said Yes. There was a flash in them, a spark of surprise, of a terrible, grateful recognition. Someone has finally asked.   That is who he was. A man who answered the truth with his eyes even when his voice was stolen, even when his body was a prison. He gave me the lie I needed with his head, and the truth I could not bear with his gaze. My guilt is laminated in that moment. I handed him the key to his own cage and called it compassion.  Then I grabbed his hands. I didn’t hold them. I seized them. I wanted to press my skin into the memory of his—the calluses from jute rope, the cracks like riverbeds in a drought, the hard knots of knuckle. I was trying to steal the solidity of him, to take his strength into my own crumbling architecture. And then I did what we are taught to do without feeling: I put my head to his feet.   My forehead against the cool, dry sole. And it was not an act of worship but of wiring. A final, desperate circuit. In that touch flowed every unspoken word: I forgive you for leaving, forgive me for staying, forgive us for this, forgive me for this, I am sorry I am sorry I am so sorry. The ritual was empty until it was the only thing left that was full.  The white clothes are here. In Tehrathum. In the dark hold of an old tin trunk in the house that smells of mothballs and memory. They have not been washed. They hold the shape of his year of mourning for his mother, and the scent of the morning he took them off to re-enter the world. They are a folded silence. I have not opened the trunk. I am afraid they will be pristine. I am more afraid they will be stained.  After the machine’s hum was stopped, there was no sound of mercy. Mercy has no sound. There was only the void where the hum had been, a sudden, deafening vacancy in the air, and inside me, in the deepest, most silent corner of my heart, a scream so vast it had no vibration. A scream made of pure void. That was the sound. The sound of a silent star collapsing.  And now the absence is not an empty space but a presence in reverse. It is the big bed. The one that takes up half the room. It is not the emptiness of the bed that kills me, but the fullness it once held. The weight of his exhausted body at noon, claiming a half-hour siesta—a little, daily rehearsal for eternity. The sound of his breath evening out after the morning’s war with the world. That small death he took every day was a kindness he gave himself. Now the bed is a raft adrift in the room’s sea, and the sunlight that once patterned his sleep falls on nothing but worn cotton, bleaching the colour from the very fabric.  This is the geometry. The room is the same. The walls stand. The roof holds. But the centre is gone, and so every angle is now a lie. The doorway expects a shadow that does not cross it. The floor waits for a pressure it will never feel. The evening light hits a patch of wall and burns with a useless, beautiful fire.  What can I do but let this stand? Tirings asked for grief, guilt, and goodbye. They are not three things. They are one chemical reaction. Grief is the atmosphere. Guilt is the soil. Goodbye is the ugly, beautiful weed that grows between them, its roots cracking the bedrock of your life. You cannot separate them. You can only describe the colour of the flower, which is the colour of a nod that meant no and yes, and the texture of its stem, which is the texture of a father’s hand you gripped too late to hold on, but just in time to finally feel.  This is the excavation. This is the clearing. The dirt is under my nails. The artifact is in my hands.   It is wet. It is cold. It is real.",

I don’t talk about them for the same reason I don’t complain that a dead body isn't working, everyone knows they are the past. My disappointment comes from the living hope we have today.  When the 2025 Gen Z movement happened, the country was ready to give Balen everything. He chose to pass that power to an interim government led by Sushila Karki. We trusted her because he told us to. Today, as 76 families still wait for justice and the murderers are still protected, why is the man who gave the guarantee staying silent? Is silence a leadership quality, or is it an exit strategy?  People call Harka 'aggressive' or 'a laborer.' But remember: this man refused a Home Ministry post because he wouldn't bow at a foreign embassy for a 'stamp of approval.' He chose the soil over a seat. While the privileged mock his 'muddy hands,' he is the only one showing us what a sovereign leader looks like. Why are we so comfortable with 'polite' silence and so offended by 'honest' noise?  If we don't hold them accountable now, how are the 'New Parties' any different from the 'Old' ones by the time we reach the ballot box?",

I am a student and not a hardcore gamer but i do like playing games, especially open world games like rdr2.  I am confused whether i should go for the typical gaming laptops like the legion series or the predator series(open to other recommendations) or go for the sleeker gaming laptop (asus rog zephyrus or others with similar specs like the bulkier laptops but better display and less power supply to the GPU).  The sleeker ones looked more premium with better battery life and portability (considering i need to carry laptop to my uni almost everyday).   But the bulkier ones obviously have better cooling, higher power supply and are better for longer continuous tasks.  So, if any of you have those sleeker ones, can you please tell me how much of a difference does it make or are they pretty much unusable without external cooling for longer gaming sessions?",

I am a student and not a hardcore gamer but i do like playing games, especially open world games like rdr2.   I am confused whether i should go for the typical gaming laptops like the legion series or the predator series(open to other recommendations) or go for the sleeker gaming laptop (asus rog zephyrus or others with similar specs like the bulkier laptops but better display and less power supply to the GPU).   The sleeker ones looked more premium with better battery life and portability (considering i need to carry laptop to my uni almost everyday).   But the bulkier ones obviously have better cooling, higher power supply and are better for longer continuous tasks.      So, if any of you have those sleeker ones, can you please tell me how much of a difference does it make or are they pretty much unusable without external cooling for longer gaming sessions?",

Otherwise it's more complicated. Here is one: https://evostore.com.np/BoostCharge-Pro-3port-Power-Bank-20K  If you have higher budget then you can consider getting a new laptop. You can get a MacBook Air starting at a bit less than 1L and the battery life will be fantastic.  You could also consider a tablet, if it works. Cheap Android tablets, or if you have the budget for it, iPads.  You could also go to study places. Many of them do offer charging ports too. See if you have one nearly within your budget.",

Nepal is such a beautiful country and the people are so humble, it’s rich in natural resources. If only we all can come together we can develop Nepal into a wonderful country that we truly deserve. If people still don’t wake up and rise above their greed and ego, this might be the last time for Nepal and us as Nepalese. Why don’t they get it? They don’t develop Nepal on purpose so that they can continue asking for aids which they pocket in its entirety.

But with her huge following and influence, why not run from her own home district and take one seat away from the old parties?  This feels like the new people are fighting each other instead of really challenging the old parties.  I don't think Ashika is suited to be a lawmaker, she's doing good as an activist.

            "body": "Hi everyone, I’m Avishek. ​I’m 25 now, originally from Nepal but currently living in the US. The other day, I was sharing an old story with a friend about my first love in high school. He got so hooked on the details that he started demanding I tell him the next part every single day. ​He told me, \"Man, you have to write this down.\" So, I’ve decided to try. If you guys find this interesting, I will keep writing and posting the next chapters daily. If the feedback is good, I might even turn this into a proper book one day. ​For context: In Nepal, High School (Grade 11 and 12) is a huge transition. This is where it started. I was a student in high school. When I was admitted to Grade 11, everything felt new. I was far from home and felt underconfident. I didn't have any friends and felt quite alone, so I decided to spend my break time in the library because I am a book lover. In the fiction section, I chose the book The Boy,The Mole,The fox and the Horse. I took it to a table and started reading. Suddenly, I saw a girl. She had a \"wolf cut\" hairstyle, fair skin, and was wearing a short skirt with a fitted shirt. She looked perfect and seemed very kind. She was a Grade 12 student helping the new Grade 11 students find books. She picked up Fifty shades of gray  and sat right next to me. I had already seen the movies( Fifty shades of gray). seeing her felt like love at first sight. I had never been in a relationship before, and I didn't even have any female friends.  For the next two months, I didn't see her even once. I felt terrible. It was as if she existed on that first day and then vanished from the school entirely. Eventually, our first exams arrived. On the first day of the exam, I caught a glimpse of someone who looked like her. I dropped my study materials on the ground and started running toward her, but the Discipline Incharger(DI) stopped me. I felt like I had lost her all over again.  I looked for her during every follow-up exam but never saw her. On the last day of exams, I finally saw the same girl. I was hesitant to talk to her, but I gathered my confidence. I was confused about how to start the conversation. I just said, \"Hi\" and then added, \"Hey, do you remember me from the library on the first day of Class 11?\" She looked confused. While I had noticed her, she hadn't noticed me that day. She said, \"No, I don’t recognize you. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't remember! Did we meet in a club or a class? I felt Nervous and quickly said, \"No thanks\", It was a mistake and left. that was the last day of exams.  After a 15-day of holiday break, I saw her again in the school canteen. I was with my friends , so I didn't speak to her. I started wondering why I never saw her during breaks. I realized that Grade 11 and Grade 12 have breaks at different times! On the first day, she had only been there as a volunteer to help us explore the college. I became a bit obsessed with the idea of meeting her. I decided to wait for her after school on a Friday. In Nepal, Saturdays are holidays, so Fridays are \"fun-days.\"I was so nervous that I lost track of time, just hoping to see her face one more time. I waited for at least an hour and a half. Finally, she came out with a group of friends. I was nervous because I had never approached a girl before, especially in front of her friends. I gathered my courage and went up to her. I said, \"Hey, I’ve been waiting for you here for almost two hours.\" She was surprised and asked, \"Why would you wait for me for so long?\" I asked, \"Can I walk home with you?\" She stopped for a minute, looked at me, and said,",

There is a free program called Flavortown run by Hack Club in collaboration with GitHub for high school students ages 13–18. Students build and ship open source projects on GitHub and earn points for the time they spend.  Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.  Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

I threw the cigarette and the freshly bought pack in the bin and that was it.  It’s been 6 months now. Haven’t touched one since.  Yeah, the urge came back once or twice, mostly while drinking. But I didn’t give in. Every time I didn’t, it felt like a small win.  Honestly, quitting smoking is the best decision I’ve ever made.  If you’re young or just getting into it, QUIT NOW. It’ll suck for a few days, maybe weeks. But you’ll get through it. And that win stays with you for life.  If I could walk away after 10 years, you can too.",

Its a win|||So, this happened. After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.  After finally catching him up, i tried to have a normal convo with him. there were only two of us who found and caught him at that time. we were waiting for others to come. my another friend went out to bring water for him. Suddenly, he leveraged the situation to run away from me. I got injured in my head and hand  Then i tried chasing him. The only thing in my mind was, dude it took so long and effort to finally find him. He was attempting to harm himself at times. So, we couldn't let him get away. But i couldn't keep up. **Years of smoking, and long hours at work finally caught up.** Here, i am supposed to be the most athletic in the group.  I couldn't keep up with this rogue guy. I got tired instantly. It really sucked. We were finally able to catch him. The dude tried to hit me up with stones and all. but i managed to get hold of him.  I have not smoked since and i don't intend to ever again. Also, i left the job|||Agree with you!! You can't plan on quitting it has to be sudden with no backups or cheeky puffs!!   Stopped smoking since may 2023 its been a life changing decision. And about the urge to smoke it never left me. After 2yrs when i see someone smoke on the roadside i get the urge to smoke. Ig once you started smoking the urge will last forever just don't loose to that urge.   And you'll be so proud of yourself|||Congratulations 🎊|||👍🏼|||For anyone who is looking for quitting app, would love to see your reviews with dhuwa.com its an smoking replacement and awareness app, just give it a try, if anyone needs it|||Good on you mate|||That is great for you.  Hoping you have a long healthy life|||Congratulations Bro! Keep it up|||Sorry, but nicotine doesn't let you leave without paying a price.|||Well done bro!  I quit smoking cigarettes and weed couple of years ago. Weed ta aboh kaam ma Drugs and Alcohol test le garda kheri ho tara cigarettes was coz one morning I was at work and some guy walked in after smoking. Teti bela I just started thinking to myself, is this how bad I smell and does everyone in the office look at me disgusted like I am doing right now? So tya bata I just stopped smoking automatically. I also threw away all my packs.  Later on I got urges to smoke after couple of months and that’s when I fucked up… I started vaping and that shit was too addictive than cigarettes because you can literally vape in your room, car anywhere… so it took me a while to decide to stop vaping too after 3 years…   Whatever you are all doing, please don’t turn to vaping thinking it will help you quit cigarettes… it will just reverse everything!  To all the quitters, please stay strong 💪🏼|||crazy|||Great job. I did that with weed. Decided this is my last one and it has been 7 years haven't smoked any.  I'm using vape to quit smoking but I'm happy with smoking 1 pack every year.|||Life won't get any better. I quit for 4 years and started again.",

            "body": "I grew up in a very strict household where we were only expected to study. Hanging out with friends was rare, sleepovers weren’t allowed, and even relaxing felt wrong. When relatives visited, my mom would get angry and stressed because of chores, so I learned to be hyper-aware of her moods. Even watching movies or playing outside would make her angry and this behavior worsened when i was a teenager. As a teenager, I wasn’t rebellious. I just shut down. I’d lie in bed, stare at the ceiling, pretend to study, and feel quietly depressed instead of doing what I wanted.  Now as an adult, I feel disconnected from people.

As I grew older I started to accept that it is completely okay and even necessary to do the things I enjoy and love and just hang out with the people I like, and that I don't have to try so hard to fit in. Only by pursuing what I myself wanted to do (and not getting involved in things I didn't really) did I start feeling like my authentic self, who I had kept suppressed inside me. It helped that I'm abroad now and also seeing a therapist occasionally to talk through such trauma.  Push yourself to do the things you want and don't judge yourself so harshly. You aren't going to vibe with everyone but treasure those who like you (or will come to like you) as you are|||Jokes aside, touch some grass.

That is a natural progression to what you’re feeling. You did not grow in a social environment, of course it won’t feel natural to socialise.   On one hand you will begin to improve in socialising if you keep doing it and also realise that socialising is a two way street. On the other hand, what you learned in your childhood will stick with you for a long time. You will always be hyperaware of your surroundings. Specially the people.   Don’t forget to realise a few facts every once a while. This is the loneliest generation there’s ever been. Everybody is afraid to make the first move. We didn’t deserve to be burdened with the pile of shit they received from someone else but such is life. Let’s get on with it. If you need someone to talk to, you can send me a message, take care now. ✌🏼|||Same here but I'm yet not adult, I don't feel like confronting someone or make a deal of sth even when it needs to be done.  I don't let myself be trampled on but argument drains me . I don't ask anything and I don't even dare to become angry with my elders ..even though I feel resentment. 😭|||I felt this man, the relatives visiting and mom getting moody is so real. I had the exact same environment and I'm just starting to see how it's so deeply rooted in me now in my early twenties. I can't voice my feelings out or express what I want without feeling like my throat is tied with barbed wires bro.  Everytime I try and speak my emotions or feelings, even basic ones that don't seem like much to other people, I start getting tears in my eyes and I automatically shut down. Can't get a word of my opinion out. Don't even get me started on fights, misunderstandings and disagreements. They feel like hell to me even though I know it's nothing big.  It might feel like there's nothing you can do about it but trust me, it will go away even if it takes a lot of sacrificing your comfort zones. Don't cancel plans when your friends ask to hangout, start letting them in your heart, relationships require sacrifices too, you gotta do things that you don't really wanna do and instead just sit in your room alone. Get out of this loop, go for a short hangout with people that you feel comfortable with, start investing in friendships and I'm sure it's gonna start feeling better.  There's times where I feel like I'd be better off alone in this world, I don't need people at all, and that friends are just intervening my life. That happens so often. You don't need to push these feelings away, let it come but then let it go. Humans do need people after all. So please get out and make changes, even if you have to fake it. It will get you going.  Also the most important part, let your parents be disappointed, as controversial as this may sound, that's the only way you can brace your heart and start doing what you want. Parents do get worried and that's valid but as a saying goes \"ships are safe in the harbor but ships are made to sail\", yes you are comfortable and safe and away from your parents nagging in that room, but how long will you let that keep you lonely?|||You have my sympathy.|||It's same for rebel too.....I'm very rebellious but the amount of energy u drain is crazy.......so to restore it I stay back at home most of the time..........|||Rebelling is the key  I just entered adulthood, and I rebel a lot and eventually they'll give up (hopefully)|||Just believe in ‘teleology’ instead of ‘aetiology’.

The few times I hung out with Nepalis I realized they're basically living in Nepal with Nepali mentality while abroad. Many had moved abroad and lived there for decades but were still unaware of many Western customs-they just didn't assimilate into the culture. I could see how much they missed out on. I just didn't want to be in that situation. So, you're right, because as many others have mentioned, immigrants don't get out of their comfort zone, they miss out on a lot.

For most young people: -   Most Nepali come here to work on a student visa, not for study. They enroll in a cheap college which is mostly populated with Nepali or foreigners from south asian countries.   Then, they need to find work, since they can’t work more than 20 hours legally, they need to find work in cash, so they need to network with Nepali people who work in cash to bypass the work hour requirements.   Then, they need to find a cheap place to stay. Probably 2-4 people crammed in a single room sleeping in bunk beds. Guess who is willing to do that ? Other Nepali or south asians.   For married couples :  They don’t live in crammed rooms but navigating lives and work pressures help them better relate with eachother than foreigners of that land.  ——————————  It is not a nepali trait or south asian trait. It is a socio-economic trait.   Nepali students who actually can afford their tuition without working illegally having a partner just to make ends meet live a completely different life.   They have the luxury to go out after college to socialize, visit new places with friends, participate in clubs and events. Become members of universities bodies, a representative or host in Universities, and many other involvement where they make connections with people of all backgrounds. They explore leadership opportunities and develop their social skills.  All this while most Nepali students don’t have enough time to sleep cus they have to earn, pay for tuition and send money back home. God bless them, they are so tough. I could have never been able to do that.   ———————  I was lucky enough not to worry about money and my tuition. So i had a lot of free time. There was a point where I knew almost everyone in my Uni ( literally speaking ) and i used to host weekly events in uni. I have got friends from all over the globe. I knew just 2 nepali people from my uni, just 2 ( one was a girl i dated, if i wasn’t dating her, I don’t think we would have spent any time together ). I tried to find more but i never bumped into nepali people in any in places i found myself in.   Not a single Nepali person besides me, in my entire college degree, across all courses. Not a single Nepali person in any events I attended. I was the only Nepali in the first two jobs i did.   Unless i went to nepali events, i was not around Nepali people. I go to Nepali events just to meet Nepali people so i can make more Nepali friends because almost none of my friends are Nepali.   ———————  So yeah, there are some language and cultural barriers but these are insignificant.

Did we really cross ethnic lines in Nepal or did we stay comfortably within our own circles? Did a Pahadi genuinely sit, eat, celebrate, and struggle alongside a Madhesi and vice versa? How many close friends did we truly have from so called lower castes not just as acquaintances but as people we regularly hung out with, defended, and learned from? How many of us who ask this question actually learned Maithili, Bhojpuri, Newari, Tamang, Gurung, or Tharu by choice and not because we had to?  If we did not assimilate in a country as diverse as Nepal, why do we expect people to suddenly become global citizens the moment they cross a border?  Isn’t it human nature to seek familiarity when everything else language, culture, food, accent is unfamiliar? When someone is already navigating visas, racism, homesickness, and identity struggles, is it really surprising that they hold on to the one space where they do not have to explain themselves?  And when Nepalis abroad spend time with other Nepalis, is it exclusion or survival? Is posting vlogs and photos with familiar faces a rejection of the world or simply documenting comfort? Do we ask the same questions about Italians Chinese or Mexicans abroad or do we reserve this criticism only for Nepalis?  Maybe the real question is not why they do not explore but why we romanticize exploration abroad while ignoring the lack of it at home.  If we could not fully embrace diversity in Nepal a country with dozens of languages countless cultures and everyday diversity, what makes us think a plane ticket alone changes that?|||1) Just because you want to hang out with them doesn’t necessarily mean they also wanna do the same. Lot of White colored people do want to hangout with other white people only. Lot of white people only want to date white people. It doesn’t have to be racism and could just be of choice. Whats happening in the US today isn’t happening because of 1 person disliking non white population, there are many as such. So yea, for 1 they also do not like to hangout with non white people so thats kinda why Nepali are seen hanging out with their own.  2) Its also not very easy to hangout with different cultures. The reason nepali people gets along with Indians is due to commonality between our culture the way we are brought up. That just makes it easy to communicate and of course functions and religion bring us together. Sometimes our upbringing makes it so difficult to hangout with white culture. Something Thats very basic or normal to us might be offending to them.   These are some basic reasons why nepali are seen hanging out with other nepali or just desi community. Even our struggles are similar, so it’s out of convenience and commonalities.|||Why do Nepali people abroad only eat Nepali food?? There are so many better options|||I avoid Nepalis like the plague",

Or is it a tactical move to reach specific \"pockets\" of voters that have been traditionally overlooked?

            "body": "After spending the last three years moving between digital marketing, software projects, and teaching, I thought I was building the “right” life. Good income, modern work, flexibility on paper but something felt missing.   So during breaks and holidays, I started asking myself a serious question:  What kind of work actually leads to a happy life?  I began researching different sectors and talking to people. Eventually, I kept coming back to agriculture.  I started visiting farms and speaking with farmers. I asked almost every one of them a simple question: \"Are you happy with your life?”  Almost all of them said yes  without hesitation.  And that surprised me.  These weren’t people living in luxury. Some of them had loans. Some worked long hours. Some didn’t own fancy things. But they had something that felt rare:  * They controlled their time * They worked with their hands and the land * They lived close to their families * They saw the direct result of their effort every day  Meanwhile, I noticed something else. In places like the USA and Australia, many people spend 30 years paying off homes and farmland. On paper, they are “successful.” But many of them barely see their families, live under stress, and don’t feel free.  So what actually makes someone happy?  It doesn’t seem to be money, or job title, or how modern your work is. It seems to be perception, freedom, purpose, and family.  Farmers may not be rich in the way society defines it but many of them are rich in time, peace, and connection. And those are things money can’t easily buy.  This made me rethink everything I was chasing.  Maybe happiness isn’t about climbing higher.   Maybe it’s about standing somewhere that feels right.  I ask everyone what happiness define you ?",

Will he be happy when his children blame him for not being able to give them good schooling and a stable income source?   Your analysis of happiness is valid if the farmer earns well enough for basic needs+emergencies. Even if we forget other luxuries.  I understand money does not equate happiness but I am sure no none can still be happy if they are too poor to afford basic health and education.|||Then what are all the farmer suicides about?

Not to mention, fertilizers are never on time nor are quality seeds.   Stop romanticizing the labor and hard work of other .  Anyway, if you know that, why are you not being happy by starting farming ? Are you going to start farming? Or it’s just let them be happy why you suffer in screen and then post like you had epiphanies 😏🤣  But again, who is farmer? The one who owns land but don’t farm? Or the one who does the farming but is paid as labor? Since, they all claim it as agricultural income. Define farmer for me too.

Case 2: Deuba and old parties are instructed to hold on to power by India and China.  Why?- Lets look in Europe. Lookup Victoria Nuland: she is high level US diplomat (probably retired now)believed to be the mastermind behind election of Zelensky in Ukraine and probably pushing for the war (there are leaked audio clips too probably available in internet.).  A coincidence that she happened to have visited Nepal and Bangladesh in 2023.   A coincidence that most of the emerging Gen-Z leaders happen to have ties to US and Europe supported leadership programs. For instance Rakshya Bam was part of it back in 2021-22 or something like that. Let us not forget that that Late King Birendra was killed in one of the most secured places in Nepal. Something about police shooting young people all of sudden doesn’t make sense at all.   A coincidence that she is closely linked with Gagan Thapa who coincidently happens to have the biggest voice for MCC and has close ties with US embassy. Could be a ploy to weaken existing parties to bring RSP to power. With RSP in power you get a government and youngsters who grew up hating neighbours (india and china-probably china not as much)which can now be easily manipulated and controlled.  Why again? India and China are aligning with Russia and in process of formation of alliance to stand up against US. Lookup BRICS. Not to forget their rise and rising dominance in global trade while US is sinking in debt.  Nepal, bangladesh, pakistan are going to be nerves which US and Europe would like to press every now and then to pressure India and China.   Could it be that Nepal is just a battleground for war being fought somewhere else? Very likely.   I would not be surprised if Nepal turns into a battleground in next 5-10 years, where madesh, free Tibet and gorkhaland issues start to resurface.  Interesting and dark times could be ahead. Probably not the best times to godify western taught youth leaders to align and take command of Nepal. Tada ko deuta vanda najik ko bhoot thik. Probably need organic nepali politicians to lead. Best case scenario for Nepal could be the return of king or have pro-china or pro-india gov. Gagan is probably not the best person. Possibly why Deuba could be backed by India and KP and PKD by china.  Chances are there are bigger things at play. See what happens.",

The ‘best’ ones are British and Lincoln but I would say Rato Bangla also lives up to par.

If in lalitpur, st.xavier or rato bangla is your best bet.|||kaasthamandap is a safe option|||Hiya, Ive seen some concerns abt St. Xavier's and as a student who studied there from 1 to 12 in both the Jawalakhel and Maitighar campus i can assure you that religion or pushing christianity down your throat is like the least concerning part of the school. Most teachers aren't christians, similarly with the students. Its non existent. The most christian part of the school is that they can provide catechism classes to some Christian students if they want it and they have mass or smthing (i was never went/had to go).   I'm an atheist and grew up in a Buddhist family so i can say that much. Other than that, the school is pretty good, not as modern as other schools since the fee is def at the lower end of the spectrum for good schools. The school campus is nice but the classrooms are meh at best. They have pretty nice clubs and has the whole traditional english house system like in hogwarts with a head girl/boy situation. The A levels dept in maitighar defo got the most funding. Also the +2 dept in maitighar is def one of if not the best in ktm. Like people prep for the entrance exams to study there but personally it's more the students that are good. Also your child needs to pass an entrance exam to even get into grade 1 actually, i forgot abt that.|||I come from a diplomat family so we move places often. My little brother went to Kathmandu World School and he loved it.

Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run.

So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.

Then there was a brief rise in ethical hacking and backend. now  everyone has suddenly moved to AI and ML. Dipping your feet into too many things usually takes you nowhere.  Any subject you choose to study should be something you actually care about. not to mention if you are good at youll get hired and get paid. The reason so many people are not being hired right now is because the bar is too high. Every field is either boom or bust, or at best cyclical. There are honestly so many interesting areas a CS student could go deep into, but instead, if you look at the codebases of many grads, their GitHub is full of AI slop, useless backend projects, and frontend work that is completely vibecoded. The UI and UX are usually a mess too, with tacky color choices, (obv gradients because it's completely vibecoded) random fonts, and no sense of design fundamentals.  Instead of chasing trends like this, please  study things that genuinely excite you. You could focus on  networking, embedded systems, RTOS, post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, geospatial systems and GIS, quantum computing, computational hardness like P vs NP, cloud systems, or even proper HCI. These are fields that actually reward understanding, not just copying tutorials. Not only that evey AI companies will hire these people.   Companies that depend heavily on hardware will always need strong backend, systems, and network engineers. That demand does not disappear just because a new framework or buzzword shows up. Learning trends without fundamentals might get you a flashy repo, but it rarely builds real engineering skill.",

However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions.

Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering. Are there any Government Institutions in Nepal that would recognize my degree as eligible for such positions?",

As a final-year CSIT student, I didn't have a corporate budget, so I had to be strategic with free and low-cost resources.  I see a lot of people asking if 1 month is enough. It is, but I studied **6 hours a day** strictly. Here is exactly how I did it.  **The Timeline (30 Days)**  * **Days 1-12:** Watched the FreeCodeCamp AWS course (Andrew Brown) on YouTube. I didn't just watch; I took notes on *everything*. * **Days 13-20:** Deep dive into **Tutorials Dojo Cheatsheets**. This was a lifesaver for confusing topics like VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway. * **Days 21-29:** The Grind. I used **ExamPrepper** and went through **1,019 practice questions**. * **Day 30:** Rest & Light review.  **The Resources:**  1. **FreeCodeCamp (YouTube):** Best free resource to understand the basics. 2. **Tutorials Dojo (Cheatsheets):** Mandatory for understanding the small differences between services. 3. **ExamPrepper:** I did 1,000+ questions. This helped me build speed and learn to spot \"distractor\" answers.  **Exam Experience:** The questions were wordy. Managing time was harder than I thought. Because I practiced so many questions beforehand, I could quickly identify keywords (e.g., \"highly available\" vs \"cost-optimized\").  Happy to answer any questions about the exam or my schedule!",

            "body": "I’m genuinely curious about RankMeTop’s intern selection  process. I’ve noticed that they post SEO intern positions on LinkedIn very frequently, almost every few days. I’m wondering what kind of interns they are actually looking for, or why they keep opening intern positions so often.  Is it because they receive many applications but don’t select interns easily, or is there another reason (like short-term internships, training batches, or high turnover)?  I’m asking out of curiosity and to better understand how companies manage intern select. If anyone has experience with RankMeTop or similar companies, I’d appreciate your insights.",

That's why we are very selective in our process and if you are able to solve the problem we give you, well you will be selected obviously.  Also you are free to use google in interview so we judge based on how well you can research and come to a conclusion. The questions are made such that even someone with 0 SEO knowledge can search and solve it.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Speaking as a devil's advocate: tesko bau pardada lai timro bau pardada ley kasari achhut bhanera treat garey, tesko answerable timi aafai na holau.  But remember, the system is trying to correct that systemic oppression by allowing a percentage of people who never really stood a chance in the first case just to achieve equality.

I do not believe I'm a different breed than the ale bhai I befriended in my cowboy days, just because we spawned out of different wombs. Equity doesn't need to sniff for financial conditions.

Renu has made a name for herself in Bharatpur but this will be an election for parliament and not mayor. Last election chitwan had a rabi effect where people in other constituencies voted for him because he was contesting from chitwan and his influence was so immense even the constituency in the neighbouring district were effected. Nawalpur which was considered a stronghold of NC nearly lost to RSP in 2079. Also, chitwan - 3 was won by RPP and previously by prachanda. Even though renu had influence in the constituency, they did not risk prachanda.

Expect to see rabi campaigning aggressively in chitwan -3 than chitwan - 2|||from being chitwan 3 I see it very unlikely Renu would lose this election. Despite she being Prachanda's daughter, she has made a name for herself as a mayor here. If Rabi was going against her, then this would've been a tight competition imo.

I think Rabi should shift to 3 and let Sobita in number 2.|||One seat wasted for RSP.|||In no world, sobita gautam winning against Renu Dahal. lol. thats pretty much loss in her part..   RSP know this, probably trying to sacrifice her or its some ninjutsu we dont know.   But no way RSP winning Renu dahal.  Renu dahal ko vote is renu dahal ko vote, vote that doesnt belong to renu dahal is bikram pandey ko vote. RSP must be crazy to think they will win against two established name in Chitwan 3.   I will not be suprised if jamanat jabt hunxa RSP ko.|||Okay my family member 4 vote for sure|||If she goes to Chitwan-3, I guess it's a bad move from RSP. She has won a direct seat previously. Now going against Renu will be hard even if Rabi helps her in campaign. She is someone I hoped to see in parliament.|||ma ni chitwan -2 ko ho ani nobody against renu dahal would win in chitwan, except chitwan 2  already heavyweight battle cha renu ra bikram pandey ko ani sobita janu is bad move honestly rasapa ley afno HOR ko 1 seat ghatako jastai ho|||Why doesnt Balen contest from Mahhotrai. Thats his birthplace right?   Its also better for RSP to get control over Madesh province. Let Sobita contest from here.|||Balen should go and contest against Renu in her own backyard or KP or prachanda or anyone of those big names. Balen is at peak now and this will be best satisfaction story for new generation|||Renu has good PR team that says she has done amazing work in Bharatpur however the reality is that all the roads and infrastructure work was done by the central government. She shouldn't win the election|||Bad move. If Rabi himself contested against Renu he would have won. I see very low chances. Tara ke tha sab game huna sakcha, ajkal ta kei ko biswas lagdaina jatho|||Renu will win. She has done wonders for bharatpur people|||Bikram Pandey laughing from Chitwan 3|||Haha balen lai Mayor re party ko upa sabhapti bhnnera kina nabhneko hol|||RSP can sweep chitwan 3. First, rsp has a good base there. Second, Renu has done some works, but more manipulation of media people and influencers to brand her as developmentalist. She has been surrounded by few controversies. One example: dumping of waste in narayani river. Third, prachanda ran away from chitwan-3 last election thinking ravi will contest from chitwan-3. Ravi´s craze is even more now with balen and kulman joining rsp. A strong rsp candidate can be victorious. Fourth, there is a decline in craze of uml and congress among under 35 people of chitwan. I myself interacted with few people from different wards of bharatpur and madi and barring few, all said they won`t vote for big 3 and bikram pandey and are looking for new political force.  P.S.- Personally, I do not think shobita will contest from chitwan -3 against renu. Her businessman husband is super close with prachanda and even shobita has become close with prachanda due to family matters. Plus she won kathmandu-2 last time just because of ravi craze at that moment. Not even 500 people from kathmandu-2 heard about her before. She is indeed a good orator and law student. i have known her since AYON days when she lost a election in ayon. Besides good oration in parliament, she has literally not done anything for kathmandu -2. ( You can ask any voter of kathmandu 2, like tinkune, sinamangal area, pepsocola what she has done for kathmandu-2 ) I hope rsp will bring some local candidate from chitwan with clean image. If rsp brings shobita, she will definitely cut vote of other candidates and any unpredictable result can come. She can grab good votes, but not enough to win the election.   - And i m not Rsp member or fan, just a curious youth following nepali politics 😀|||Balen mulla KP oli ko against ma uthne bhanera ufrirathiyo ta",

I remember a similar situation involving one of my friends. At the time, he was married and had a child, and there was a significant age difference between him and a relative of his wife who was living with them. One evening, during a casual conversation, my friend shared that over time he noticed the person trying to become emotionally closer to him. He said that although he initially had no such intentions, she later expressed a desire for a secret relationship, emphasising that it was not about emotions or commitment.|||Xya kasto disgusting..man ta man vayi halyo (not excuse but ghero se kya umeed) Tara afnei buini testi??

Don’t treat us with respect we leave and find someone better. That’s just the way it is.   If she had treated him better, he would not have gotten close to her sister. It just shows that she is a toxic person that doesn’t care for that man. Not talking for 1-2 months over a small argument is just not it. Especially after pregnancy (meaning he’s not getting laid). A man has needs. Intimacy and Respect.  Good on him for finding someone better when he didn’t get what he want from his partner. It’s good to leave people who don’t talk to you for 1-2 months after a spat and can’t find it within themselves to apologize.",

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating ..

Most south asian countries are poor and underdeveloped, that shouldnt be where we set the standard for ourselves.|||I think i can perhaps contribute a slightly different perspective here. I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations.

When partners don’t witness the birth of their child or see the physical and emotional pain a mother goes through, it’s hard for them to truly understand how difficult motherhood really is. Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.  Maybe this is one way men can finally begin to understand a woman’s journey to motherhood. Unlike our parents’ and grandparents’ generation, societal change has to start somewhere and this feels like an important step forward.",

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.  After finally catching him up, i tried to have a normal convo with him. there were only two of us who found and caught him at that time. we were waiting for others to come. my another friend went out to bring water for him.

Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run.

I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

OP is just complaining that he's not getting any action even after having a rare card.. so he wishes he had a normal card.. and it would solve his problems..   He just wants to be small, ~5'8 and ignored again..|||6'6\" here never got approached by any girl . Always put efforts from my side . Got a spotlight but not attraction .  The worse part is that people laugh at your back or sometimes in face , people looks  at you as if you're  alien .  Your can't get your desired cloth or shoes  . Being outlier is tough .|||6ft basic ho aaile ma 11 maii 6ft thiye|||Lmfao suru dinma ta approach garna aauxan ta hau|||Western bs mero opinion ma chai , height doesn't really matter especially Nepal ma girls already are so short I don't think they'd want 6ft guys when they are like 5'4 , 5'5 in average 😂.

The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

So yeah.  But girls bias that exists mostly coz of pedos I assume.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Government killed 1000+ youths and they burned down so many buildings. Even media houses for spreading false narrative.   And every time I see this kinda post they always undermine people’s life.   What would you do if your brother or sister were killed in that protest ?  Did you forget those videos of kids being shot??   And I hate this logic of that much destruction and all.  Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.  Why the fuck import based economy who is fully dependent on remittances talking about job ?  Job in kantipur ? Job in bhatbhateni ?

Then they strung it up on a gibbet and cooked and ate their livers.|||I don't feel any sympathy for these conry capitalist and their political overlords, with their illegal building made from ill-gotten gains. These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room. Extreme events were a result of us getting pushed to the extremes after decades of built-up anger, frustration, and fatally shooting our fellow school and college-going citizens by our own government.|||I think OP forgets the fact that on September 8th ... Videos and photos of kids with their brains splattered on the road were on full display... These kids of schools and colleges had no fault other than practising their constitution given right to protest peacefully..  and yet our security system deemed it right to kill these students .. through closed gates.. not one rubber bullet was fired not a single one. And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

Even from those people who are asking about those incidents now, some were resigning from their political parties, some were posting their dissatisfaction in social media.   And this is a society if you have civic sense doesn't mean everyone has.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

The problem of course for Mahendra was that Nepali Congress had two thirds majority in Parliament and he always believed with that much majority the monarchy itself was threatened.   I have also read some articles where it is said that Mahendra actually borrowed some of BP's policies like land reform policies among others.

Congress failed him and to that extent the people as well.|||Prolific writer.|||i don't know never met him|||Quakey budo|||Every country when it goes through a transformation needs an iron willed leader who has a vision not for development but for understanding structures of power and realizing institutions which uphold the political interests of the party and the government.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this. It is disappointing to see someone enjoy \"special facilities\" while ignoring the basic infrastructure the rest of us struggle with every day.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ?

If you are important enough that people might attack you, the government provides security , please ask for one .other wise there is nothing wrong in giving way, or at least trying to do so.

The artwork vividly deplicts the sacred Tuladaan ritual, in which the prince was ceremonially weighed against gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, all of which were then offered to Goddess Taleju Bhavani, the royal deity of the Malla kings.  The painting is currently housed at the \"Collège de France\" in Paris. Despite being a pricrless masterpiece, it has never been publicly displayed and remains far from its rightful home, Nepal.

When partners don’t witness the birth of their child or see the physical and emotional pain a mother goes through, it’s hard for them to truly understand how difficult motherhood really is. Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.  Maybe this is one way men can finally begin to understand a woman’s journey to motherhood.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

            "body": "So when you compare real monthly salaries, a Nepali officer at the Section Officer level may be earning roughly similar to or even \\*less than a peon/low-tier employee in India, once you adjust for basic pay, especially before allowances.   Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.

Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

Kehi galat nagaresi..  Also uhako math book ta padhekai ho|||You are expecting research contributions from him? But have you done a research about him? His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it. Or what you think my contribution to X is. Grow up.

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6.

Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Fake story|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.
