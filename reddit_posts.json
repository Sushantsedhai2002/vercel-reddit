            "body": "I was flying from Nepal to the USA with Turkish Airlines. I know the baggage allowance clearly: 23 + 23 kg checked, 12 kg carry-on. At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Hamro Nepal ma airport employees huney bittikai 3 wota ghar, 2 wota gaadi, “Airport ma kaam garchha” bhanne dhaak. Kaam garne bhaney jaabo airport ma. I think they’ll be shocked and disgusted at how low wages for their colleagues around the world are.|||my experience has been fine going to US from nepal most times. your carry on was 20kg? that’s crazy. most airlines are 8 kg max. that’s your fault.|||Sucks man.. Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||I posted a very relevant comment to this post about 10 hrs ago and the mods removed it with no explanation.  Here’s the whole thing that was removed:   Third party companies that provide contract services to the airlines are Nepalese companies that practice this and I say this from my own experience. I got scammed for upwards of $375 for something similar in 2024. I disputed the charges with my cc company (didn’t have time , would’ve missed the flight if not paid at the time) however they only replied to AMEX on the very last day of the dispute window with false evidence to close the case. I had no way to reopen the case and I got tired of calling the company itself. I felt helpless. It is an ongoing scam. I’ve heard a few of the similar stories from others as well. Go to the airport with enough time in hand, never pack your luggage to the max weight limit. Be firm and confident, report to the authorities, record video for evidence. I can only suggest options that may or may not work. No wonder people hate going back home from abroad. TIA has always been a bad experience.|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

I flew from cathay airlines, i had one extra bag that I needed to check( not listed when i booked the tickets). I was worried they wouldn’t let me check it, but they checked it for free.|||Make a complaint to the Turkish airlines!

I did weigh my luggages and suddenly this man had the audacity to claim that I’m not allowed to carry this much. However, I knew this can’t be possible and it seemed very scammy.  When he started to be more pushy asking for $$ I mentioned that I’m not worried about it and ik someone here ( as in the airport). Right after that he stopped bothering me and went to another dude to try his bs.  After this, I asked the front staff( a lady) working in the counter and she said I’m allowed to carry xx kg for my carry on and I’m fine.|||I always go 2 kg below weight.

I know a lot of you here are RSP supporters, so I am only asking you to please not be one dimensional. Analyze multiple variables and evaluate the scenario. Ask questions, if you support 99 things and question one aspect then you still are their supporter. Don't be pressured to defend everything.  Some sample questions:   1. Why did Rabi dai get another letter from attorney general\\[1\\] to kill the case and not go through the court process. What if mutton kaji also gets the similar letter from attorney general to silence his बाख्रा काण्ड, or बा? And for that matter anyone else make such letter. Rabi dai has already gotten it in two cases, one yesterday\\[1\\] and another for his dual passport case.  2. One prominent leader of RSP yesterday  in an interview said, \"The public has NO RIGHT to  not give RSP at least 138 seats in the parliament\"?\\[2\\]. Do you find that wording may be questionable, are you sure the other prominent ones in RSP don't feel the same? Is that mindset correct and logical?  3. Constantly attacking the ones who leave, Sumana (opportunist), Santhos Pariyar (opportunist), Mukul Dhakal (Opportunist), Kulman (opportunist) etc. All of them have expressed that RSP is run like a private company. Do you not have to regard political party fully transparent and trustworthy because they are PUBLIC instutions? Do you think may be they have merit in their conclusion, that the leadership model might be individualistic?  4. Most importantly, do we require policies, vision clarity and concrete plans to change the country for good? Is \"replacing the old guards\" enough for the kind of improvement we want? Do we not require intelligence, capability, knowledge, etc to take a whole COUNTRY forward? Social media likes and comments surely are not enough right?  and more questions.  I know I will get a lot of abuse from the majority of you, but that is ok(bring your best abuses, be creative, jhole is kind of lame). I will also ask a very tiny fraction of you, who actually question, to please not be totally demoralized. If we make enough requests and endure enough abuse, we might be able to convert one person to question on this.  \\[1\\]: [https://www.setopati.com/politics/379612](https://www.setopati.com/politics/379612)   \\[2\\]: [https://youtu.be/Hf2Oto0HZJs?t=4429](https://youtu.be/Hf2Oto0HZJs?t=4429)",

            "comments": "Not all all RSP supporters are jholeys.  And if you have not already asked this question to Congress/UML, then you are missing out on context.   The root-cause behind all of this cult-support of political parties imo is the social-engineering by congress/yemale.  Political sister orgs (cpngress/uml) everywhere, party-allocations in all gov appointments, benefit of political connection, and thier entire families faith-based political suppurt-- Congress/UML are the biggest cult-based and coercion-based party in our society.  Imagine what it takes to get out of that?  Ultra strong resolve, frustration... thats what makes them such ardent independent or alternate party supporters.  Thats why, one of the key voting voting agenda for me is which party takes stand against party-fication of our society. At least, RSP stands for that.|||1. First of all, Rabi's sahakari case is still going and what is now being withdrawn is Organised crime and money laundering case which many legal experts and ordinary people said was designed to keep Rabi Lamichhane out of active politics for years. If those cases hadn't been withdrawn then Rabi would have been automatically suspended even if he had won the coming election and it could have taken years to resolve the case. So what Rabi did was send a letter to Attorney general office to revisit the case and they did and found out several problems with that case and it was recommended to withdraw them. Many of us believe that both these cases were filed against Rabi due to political pressure exerted on the local attorney office and now the political pressure has been lifted. Also, very important to remember that almost no politician who has had sahakari case filed against them, also had both organised crime and money laundering case against them.    2. That's just one RSP leader talking, it can't be the opinion of one party and people are free to vote for whomever they want but if they want real change this time yes they should give RSP a majority so that Balen can be our new Prime minister.    3. RSP party as a whole has never attacked them officially, they have requested them to come back but some individual RSP members have and it is their choice. RSP i feel is totally transparent like they have submitted their financial records to Election commission regularly. RSP was formed just 3 years ago and whenever a new party is formed, the only way it can get real success is via a popular face (otherwise how come only RSP got 21 seats but so many other new parties got nothing). Now soon, the general convention is gonna happen and it will sort things out.    4. Replacing the old guards is absolutely the most important thing right now and yes we need visions and plans which would be presented when RSP gets its party manifesto out and when Rabi, Balen and their other candidates begin to campaign.    At the end, I don't fault anyone for asking questions but my assertion is that most of us youths have no choice but to vote for RSP this time and try to make Balen Prime minister. Are they perfect?? Absolutely not but let's give them a chance and see for ourself and if they do bad then we will vote for someone else and if they good we will vote for them again. I'm sick and tired of Nepalis believing that we should vote for NC and UML this time and maybe they will really change. No thank you.|||RSP feels like a cult now, not a party. There is no critical thinking among its supporters. They treat RSP as an institution that targets anyone who speaks against it—whether it’s comments on Sumana’s post or the recent hate against Kulman. The leaders of RSP feel entitled, and I don’t see a good way out now.|||Gagan ko mutton kaji ko k raxa proof??

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

I have a specific query regarding the documents required at the border (Sonauli or Raxaul) for the Bhansar permit:  PDF vs. Original RC: Most rental agencies are hesitant to give the original Smart Card RC and are offering a PDF/DigiLocker version instead. Will the Nepal Customs (Bhansar) office accept a color printout/PDF of the RC, or will they strictly deny entry without the original physical card?  Rental Authorization: Since the vehicle is not in my name, I know I need an NOC/Authorization letter. Has anyone successfully taken a Lucknow rental across the border recently? If so, which agency did you use?  I want to avoid a situation where I drive to the border and get turned back. Any recent experiences or advice would be helpful!  Thanks in advance.",

But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.",

            "body": "I’ve been on both sides of interviews, both taking them and giving them, and one pattern keeps showing up.  Different engineers can solve the same problem in very different ways, and that’s completely fine. There’s rarely a single “correct” solution. What matters much more to me is how the technical conversation is structured and how the candidate thinks through the problem when constraints and ambiguity are involved.  I’ve noticed many candidates jump straight to advanced tools or complex architectures. They can name frameworks confidently and describe setups that sound impressive. But when you dig a bit deeper and ask *why* certain choices were made, the fundamentals are often unclear. Basic trade-offs, assumptions, data size considerations, or failure scenarios are sometimes missing from the discussion.  With AI tools now widely available, writing code itself is no longer the hardest part. Generating a working solution is relatively easy. What’s harder, and far more valuable, is having a strong grasp of fundamentals: understanding the problem clearly, framing it correctly, reasoning about constraints, and explaining why a particular approach makes sense over others.  When I evaluate candidates, I don’t expect perfect or complete code. In many cases, a clear approach or even well-explained pseudo-code is more than enough. It tells me how someone thinks, how they reason, and whether they can build solutions incrementally instead of jumping straight to complexity.  I’m curious how others see this.  For those who interview regularly, how do you judge candidates? Do you prioritize fundamentals and problem-solving approach, or do tools and implementation details carry more weight for you?",

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

It's super common to get totally different results from one tool to the next . It really makes you question how any of them work.

I like that it gives you a clear confidence score and shows you *why* it flagged something, like pointing out low \"perplexity\" or repetitive sentence structure . It just feels more transparent. The analysis is quick, and for a free check, it's been way more helpful than some others I've used that just give you a confusing percentage.

How could Gagan Thapa have possibly shaken things up in a way that challenges the old guard? It's practically impossible without alienating key players. It didn't seem possible Even when he was holding the position of Mahamantri.  Deuba himself promised to hold the party's regular Mahadiveshan by the end of Mangshir, but he was forced to back down. If Deuba wanted the Mahadebesan before Falgun 21, and even Gagan Thapa was pushing for Mahadebesan by Falgun 21, whose agenda was it to extend Deuba's tenure until after the polls? Ticket bargaining, power plays to secure seats and favors, Probably.   Even if Deuba genuinely wanted change (big if), his inner circle wouldn't let it happen. They're already too deep in this, and let's not ignore the elephant in the room: his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, who's widely seen as one of the most corrupt figures in Nepali politics. A lot of the stains on his record trace back to her influence nepotism, scandals, you name it.  What do you all think? Is NC doomed to this cycle of stagnation, or this win by Gagan thapa ,newer generation will be break through? Civil discussion only.",

Fresh start. He likes another girl, different from the first one, proposes again, she says yes. He’s happy, confidence slowly coming back. And then… déjà vu. About a week ago, he finds out this girl is also a lesbian. But the real plot twist? His first girlfriend and second girlfriend are now dating each other. Yep. Both of them. Together. Now the whole college knows, and my guy is just standing there like a side character, wondering how his love life turned into a Netflix-level plot.

Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Muna, Sunkesra, and kopila defined my childhood.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police.

Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better.

The painting is currently housed at the \"Collège de France\" in Paris. Despite being a pricrless masterpiece, it has never been publicly displayed and remains far from its rightful home, Nepal.

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||I posted a very relevant comment to this post about 10 hrs ago and the mods removed it with no explanation.  Here’s the whole thing that was removed:   Third party companies that provide contract services to the airlines are Nepalese companies that practice this and I say this from my own experience. I got scammed for upwards of $375 for something similar in 2024. I disputed the charges with my cc company (didn’t have time , would’ve missed the flight if not paid at the time) however they only replied to AMEX on the very last day of the dispute window with false evidence to close the case. I had no way to reopen the case and I got tired of calling the company itself. I felt helpless. It is an ongoing scam. I’ve heard a few of the similar stories from others as well. Go to the airport with enough time in hand, never pack your luggage to the max weight limit. Be firm and confident, report to the authorities, record video for evidence.

As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

For most young people: -   Most Nepali come here to work on a student visa, not for study. They enroll in a cheap college which is mostly populated with Nepali or foreigners from south asian countries.   Then, they need to find work, since they can’t work more than 20 hours legally, they need to find work in cash, so they need to network with Nepali people who work in cash to bypass the work hour requirements.   Then, they need to find a cheap place to stay. Probably 2-4 people crammed in a single room sleeping in bunk beds. Guess who is willing to do that ? Other Nepali or south asians.   For married couples :  They don’t live in crammed rooms but navigating lives and work pressures help them better relate with eachother than foreigners of that land.  ——————————  It is not a nepali trait or south asian trait. It is a socio-economic trait.   Nepali students who actually can afford their tuition without working illegally having a partner just to make ends meet live a completely different life.   They have the luxury to go out after college to socialize, visit new places with friends, participate in clubs and events. Become members of universities bodies, a representative or host in Universities, and many other involvement where they make connections with people of all backgrounds. They explore leadership opportunities and develop their social skills.  All this while most Nepali students don’t have enough time to sleep cus they have to earn, pay for tuition and send money back home. God bless them, they are so tough. I could have never been able to do that.   ———————  I was lucky enough not to worry about money and my tuition. So i had a lot of free time. There was a point where I knew almost everyone in my Uni ( literally speaking ) and i used to host weekly events in uni. I have got friends from all over the globe. I knew just 2 nepali people from my uni, just 2 ( one was a girl i dated, if i wasn’t dating her, I don’t think we would have spent any time together ). I tried to find more but i never bumped into nepali people in any in places i found myself in.   Not a single Nepali person besides me, in my entire college degree, across all courses. Not a single Nepali person in any events I attended. I was the only Nepali in the first two jobs i did.   Unless i went to nepali events, i was not around Nepali people. I go to Nepali events just to meet Nepali people so i can make more Nepali friends because almost none of my friends are Nepali.   ———————  So yeah, there are some language and cultural barriers but these are insignificant. I think the socioeconomic barrier is the biggest reason why Nepali people stick together. Although for some people the cultural barriers might hold more weight|||Most People are naturally attracted to people  similar to them|||It really depends on Where you're located and type of Community you in. Right now I live in a Major City and all my friends are from States and some of them are foreigners from Japan, Nigeria, Russia, Germany, Italy.

I have a handful of non-Nepali friends whom I truly value and enjoy. It’s not that I don’t want Nepali friends but I simply don’t have many Nepali people around me that are my age to regularly hang out with (Nepali population that I have seen around me are either they are college students way too younger or way too older with kids). I do meet Nepali didi, dai, and bhauju occasionally during festivals or events, but we don’t spend time together often. Most of my friendships naturally formed through work. I came to US and started working directly!  So I have worked in 2 firms so far, I haven’t met any Nepali.   I also feel that if you move abroad for education, you’re more likely to meet many Nepali friends. There’s a sense of comfort and support, and people often help each other through shared experiences so it’s natural for them to stick together.  But hey at the end of the day whatever floats your boat!  🎉|||Why should they not?|||Okay let me just break it down. Had the generation before us taken the country in the right economic direction we would have gone to foreign universities to make new friends and learn new languages. And this used to happen as well, Nepali academics to Japan and within Colombo Plan did very well. We are doing this so that our children grow up abroad and then can go back to Nepal not to learn Nepali languages but to see the place of ‘what-could-have-beens’.|||Birds of the same feather flock together bhanne sunya chha?

Did we really cross ethnic lines in Nepal or did we stay comfortably within our own circles? Did a Pahadi genuinely sit, eat, celebrate, and struggle alongside a Madhesi and vice versa? How many close friends did we truly have from so called lower castes not just as acquaintances but as people we regularly hung out with, defended, and learned from? How many of us who ask this question actually learned Maithili, Bhojpuri, Newari, Tamang, Gurung, or Tharu by choice and not because we had to?  If we did not assimilate in a country as diverse as Nepal, why do we expect people to suddenly become global citizens the moment they cross a border?  Isn’t it human nature to seek familiarity when everything else language, culture, food, accent is unfamiliar? When someone is already navigating visas, racism, homesickness, and identity struggles, is it really surprising that they hold on to the one space where they do not have to explain themselves?  And when Nepalis abroad spend time with other Nepalis, is it exclusion or survival? Is posting vlogs and photos with familiar faces a rejection of the world or simply documenting comfort? Do we ask the same questions about Italians Chinese or Mexicans abroad or do we reserve this criticism only for Nepalis?  Maybe the real question is not why they do not explore but why we romanticize exploration abroad while ignoring the lack of it at home.  If we could not fully embrace diversity in Nepal a country with dozens of languages countless cultures and everyday diversity, what makes us think a plane ticket alone changes that?|||1) Just because you want to hang out with them doesn’t necessarily mean they also wanna do the same. Lot of White colored people do want to hangout with other white people only. Lot of white people only want to date white people. It doesn’t have to be racism and could just be of choice. Whats happening in the US today isn’t happening because of 1 person disliking non white population, there are many as such. So yea, for 1 they also do not like to hangout with non white people so thats kinda why Nepali are seen hanging out with their own.  2) Its also not very easy to hangout with different cultures. The reason nepali people gets along with Indians is due to commonality between our culture the way we are brought up. That just makes it easy to communicate and of course functions and religion bring us together. Sometimes our upbringing makes it so difficult to hangout with white culture. Something Thats very basic or normal to us might be offending to them.   These are some basic reasons why nepali are seen hanging out with other nepali or just desi community. Even our struggles are similar, so it’s out of convenience and commonalities.|||Why do Nepali people abroad only eat Nepali food?? There are so many better options|||I avoid Nepalis like the plague",

            "body": "As part of our standard check-in procedure in our hotel, when a couple arrives, we require government-issued IDs from both individuals and both signatures on the registration form.  But, I observed that we are frequently facing resistance especially when requesting the girl’s ID and signature. Most of the couple argue saying this rule exists “only in our hotel” or refuse outright. Because of this, a lot of young couples choose not to stay.  Our intention behind this policy is not to harass or embarrass anyone. There are clear reasons for it:  Both signatures confirm mutual consent to stay esp in regards to couples, protecting both guests and the hotel from future disputes or false claims.  Both IDs are important for legal accountability in case of any incident, complaint, or investigation.  Plus it also verifies the real age of both individuals, ensuring there are no underage- related legal issues.  Despite being a reputed hotel and following this policy consistently for safety and legal compliance, we’re now questioning whether this is seen as excessive.  So my genuine question is: Are we being too strict by asking for both partners’ IDs and signatures?????",

There should be a sweet spot between security and privacy so asking one ID imo is good compromise.|||A significant portion of your guests are going to be couples.

On the other hand, Gagan Thapa never had the political power and has always been an insignificant opposition within the party.   He was against coalition with communists. He was against the idea of nepali congress joining the coalition multiple times but deuba had the majority and made decisions. Now everyone's seeing whats been going on Congress since forever.  Why deuba and his close ones are trying their best to hang in power? If they lose the grip, Arzu deuba , PS Mahat , Nidhi, Prakash Man Singh all their political career is gone and high chances they'll be behind bars. On the other hand, Gagan thapa finally got some sort of NC constitutional validation in form of special convention (thanks to gen Z protest) , he's on attack mode.

Case 2: Deuba and old parties are instructed to hold on to power by India and China.  Why?- Lets look in Europe. Lookup Victoria Nuland: she is high level US diplomat (probably retired now)believed to be the mastermind behind election of Zelensky in Ukraine and probably pushing for the war (there are leaked audio clips too probably available in internet.).  A coincidence that she happened to have visited Nepal and Bangladesh in 2023.   A coincidence that most of the emerging Gen-Z leaders happen to have ties to US and Europe supported leadership programs. For instance Rakshya Bam was part of it back in 2021-22 or something like that. Let us not forget that that Late King Birendra was killed in one of the most secured places in Nepal. Something about police shooting young people all of sudden doesn’t make sense at all.   A coincidence that she is closely linked with Gagan Thapa who coincidently happens to have the biggest voice for MCC and has close ties with US embassy. Could be a ploy to weaken existing parties to bring RSP to power. With RSP in power you get a government and youngsters who grew up hating neighbours (india and china-probably china not as much)which can now be easily manipulated and controlled.  Why again? India and China are aligning with Russia and in process of formation of alliance to stand up against US. Lookup BRICS. Not to forget their rise and rising dominance in global trade while US is sinking in debt.  Nepal, bangladesh, pakistan are going to be nerves which US and Europe would like to press every now and then to pressure India and China.   Could it be that Nepal is just a battleground for war being fought somewhere else? Very likely.   I would not be surprised if Nepal turns into a battleground in next 5-10 years, where madesh, free Tibet and gorkhaland issues start to resurface.  Interesting and dark times could be ahead. Probably not the best times to godify western taught youth leaders to align and take command of Nepal. Tada ko deuta vanda najik ko bhoot thik. Probably need organic nepali politicians to lead. Best case scenario for Nepal could be the return of king or have pro-china or pro-india gov. Gagan is probably not the best person. Possibly why Deuba could be backed by India and KP and PKD by china.  Chances are there are bigger things at play. See what happens.",

Today, as 76 families still wait for justice and the murderers are still protected, why is the man who gave the guarantee staying silent? Is silence a leadership quality, or is it an exit strategy?  People call Harka 'aggressive' or 'a laborer.' But remember: this man refused a Home Ministry post because he wouldn't bow at a foreign embassy for a 'stamp of approval.' He chose the soil over a seat. While the privileged mock his 'muddy hands,' he is the only one showing us what a sovereign leader looks like. Why are we so comfortable with 'polite' silence and so offended by 'honest' noise?

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

Many companies lack basic knowledge of labor regulations and do not understand how to properly treat employees or how to handle hiring and termination processes.  I have personally experienced this multiple times, including facing discrimination during interviews. The HR policies in many Nepalese companies are extremely weak and poorly implemented.  I understand how you’re feeling right now, and my point is simply this: Nepalese companies need to adopt a culture of respect, professionalism, and fair treatment toward employees.|||Company ko culture jhalkincha.

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

Applied to around 50-60ish places over the period of 2 months, while working at a grocery store on the side      Got reply from only 2 places where 1 one of them was a scammer.   Managed to get an actual interview in the other one (backend with Golang), where I got the job.      From what I’ve OBSERVED PERSONALLY,    \\- It seems almost impossible to get a Soft Eng intern/job as a student.    \\- You NEED to have unrestricted work rights with enough time left on your visa, or a PR to have a decent chance. I was asked to fill this info in almost every job application.   \\- It’s very very difficult to land an interview. The interview itself was not that big of a deal in my experience.    \\- If you go to regional, it becomes more difficult. a friend of mine was laid off as a software engineer like 6 months ago in Perth, still hasn’t managed to find a new job.|||Hopefully people respond to this as i am in a similar predicament|||Following|||want more comments on this|||/r/NepalAbroad|||Following",

            "body": "Hi everyone,  I just passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam on my first attempt! As a final-year CSIT student, I didn't have a corporate budget, so I had to be strategic with free and low-cost resources.  I see a lot of people asking if 1 month is enough. It is, but I studied **6 hours a day** strictly. Here is exactly how I did it.  **The Timeline (30 Days)**  * **Days 1-12:** Watched the FreeCodeCamp AWS course (Andrew Brown) on YouTube. I didn't just watch; I took notes on *everything*. * **Days 13-20:** Deep dive into **Tutorials Dojo Cheatsheets**. This was a lifesaver for confusing topics like VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway. * **Days 21-29:** The Grind. I used **ExamPrepper** and went through **1,019 practice questions**. * **Day 30:** Rest & Light review.  **The Resources:**  1. **FreeCodeCamp (YouTube):** Best free resource to understand the basics. 2. **Tutorials Dojo (Cheatsheets):** Mandatory for understanding the small differences between services. 3. **ExamPrepper:** I did 1,000+ questions. This helped me build speed and learn to spot \"distractor\" answers.  **Exam Experience:** The questions were wordy. Managing time was harder than I thought. Because I practiced so many questions beforehand, I could quickly identify keywords (e.g., \"highly available\" vs \"cost-optimized\").  Happy to answer any questions about the exam or my schedule!",

            "body": "I’m a Go developer building a SaaS product. After integrating eSewa, Khalti, and ConnectIPS for the third time, I’ve decided I’m done writing \"glue code\" for every new project.  I am going to build a **Unified Nepal Payments Core** in Go.  I’m building this regardless because I need it for my own production environment, but I wanted to check with developer here if you have faced same problem and how you have solved it?  **The Problem I’m Solving (For myself, and maybe you):**  1. Architecture Mismatch: eSewa forces a legacy HTML Form POST. Khalti is JSON. ConnectIPS needs certificates. My business logic shouldn't care about these transport details. I just want a clean interface. 2. Verification Anxiety: Most tutorials I see online skip the strict signature/HMAC verification steps. I want a library that handles the crypto correctly by default so I don't have to worry about replay attacks or amount spoofing. 3. Standardized Errors: I’m tired of parsing inconsistent error responses. I want the SDK to return a standard `payment.ErrInsufficientFunds` or `payment.ErrTimeout` regardless of the underlying provider.  **The Plan:**  A \"two-layer\" architecture:  1. **Core (Open Source):** The interfaces, data models, and verification logic. 2. **Providers:** Plugins for eSewa, Khalti, IPS, etc.  **The Interface Goal:**      // 1. Setup (done once)     client := esewa.New(os.Getenv(\"ESEWA_SECRET\"))     // 2. Pay (Standard across all providers)     // I don't care if it's a Form POST or API call internally     resp, err := core.Initiate(ctx, client, &payment.Request{                  Amount: 1000,                  OrderID: \"ORD-101\",                  })  I know many developer here are Node/Python, but for the Go developers in Nepal:  1. Is this something you’d actually use in production, or do you prefer writing your own integrations to keep dependencies low? 2. If I open-source the Core interfaces, would anyone be interested in helping review the security/verification logic?",

NTX gives you a quick snapshot of NEPSE listed companies - fundamentals, charts, and some mutual fund data in one place.  **Features:**  * Company details and basic info * Fundamentals (EPS, PE, ROE, P/B, etc.) * Price charts * Open-ended mutual fund holdings - see which SIP funds like NIBL Sahabhagita or Nabil Balance Fund are holding what  Live at: [https://ntx.anishshrestha.com](https://ntx.anishshrestha.com)  **Tech stack:**  * Go backend * SvelteKit frontend * ConnectRPC for typed communication between frontend and backend * Built on top of nepse-go (my other project - a Go SDK for NEPSE API)  This was mainly a learning project to get more comfortable with Go and RPC patterns. ConnectRPC generates TypeScript clients from proto definitions which keeps types in sync across the stack without manual work. Pretty nice DX if anyone's looking into it.  **Open source:** [https://github.com/voidarchive/ntx](https://github.com/voidarchive/ntx)  Fair warning - it's not a full-fledged analysis platform or anything. Just a quick way to pull up company info. Built it for my own use so there's probably edge cases I haven't handled.  If anyone wants to poke around the code, contribute, or fork it - feel free.",

It’s been about 1.5 yrs now and I’m currently leading multiple e-commerce projects there. Rankmetop looks for strong researchers and people who genuinely want to learn and grow in SEO. If you enjoy research, experimentation & continuous learning, its a great place to work and build real SEO skills.|||This post is a marketing skit, nothing more.  All the other comments are made by employees from the same company to promote it. This whole post is bullshit. Let me tell you the real thing.  They hire interns for 10k per month. When they take interviews, they tell they have AGRESSIVE work culture. And then when the interns start working, they are given unbelievably high amount of work and responsibilities.  Their whole business revolves around hiring interns and giving all workload. Meanwhile, the project leads do minimal work, and pretend like they did all the work. Absolute dickheads.  What they do is: 1. Assign unrealistic amounts of work to interns. 2. Force them to complete it on time. 3. Obviously, they are unable to cope with the insane workload. 4. Right when the internship ends and they expect to be promoted, company says 'you couldn't meet the work expectations' and fires without notice. 5. Post vacancy again. And repeat.  They put so much pressure on everyone that their so-called 5-day work week becomes a 7-day work week because if you don't complete all tasks, you'll get fired. Typical toxic office shit.  I've been working for nearly a year, and I'm looking for better opportunities right now because these guys are crazy. On top of all the work, they DEMAND that you do home research. If you don't, they call you out for it in front of everyone. What a load of shit.  They also keep all the SEO leads in a hostel together, and there is insane groupism. Those retards cannot see any non-hosteler thrive. They get jealous and band together like a bunch of vultures. It's like a cult.|||I was wondering about the same thing.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

What I keep hearing from people and friends back home raises serious concerns about the tower’s commercial viability.  The issue is not the absence of a freight lift. The real issue sits with scale.  The building has a freight or service lift, but it is far too small for a high-rise of this size. Heavy furniture, industrial equipment, restaurant machinery, medical devices, or office setups will not fit or move efficiently.  In tall commercial buildings, freight lifts need large cabins and high load capacity. They support fit-outs, maintenance, and daily operations. A small service lift slows everything and forces people to misuse passenger lifts.  This reflects poor high-rise planning. Vertical transport should match the building height and purpose.  Residential use might still work. Commercial use looks compromised by design.|||Tara tyo building ko barema chai aawaz uthaunu parthyo tei ko janta le. It is just staying there, usless.

Shady past in U.S. (Active court cases) 2 Sahakari Case ( there are people - common people that are affected by his misadventure at the end of day) 3. Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker. We will find fault even if we get Gautam Buddha today, but still I hope whoever comes top do good for our nation.|||Ghante Thag ko support garne bhayera|||Due to formal Ravi's cooperative, citizenship issues ???|||Cause he is not baun or chhetri, this sub makes you hate anyone who is not baun or chhetri|||Didn't knew he was so power hungry. 😬|||Kulman for PM|||Ahh, I wasn't wrong.

Some people in the comments are completely missing the point. His view is simply an observation of how the world functions. Many of the practices we follow today come from rules and ideas passed down by our ancestors. Some of those teachings are worth thinking about.... they can be both spiritual and logical... But the idea that nothing matters while someone is alive, and then suddenly everything becomes love and respect after death, makes no sense. If something matters, it should matter while the person is still alive.|||and the no salt has such negative impact. My relatives who was a diabetics and pressure patient died after fasting with no salt for prolonged days just because of so called ritual she had to perform when one of her relative died.|||These are outdated traditions, so trying to find logic in them is impossible.|||Seriously such a pretentious shit.I am pretty sure they restrict food and salt to appear physically distraught ..Most of the elders are abused in our society|||One positive things is kriya baseko manxe ko mind divert hunxa instead of being mostly alone grieving phase ma, nepal ko suicide rate after someone close had died is less than other countries|||When my dad passed away, I started reading Garud Puran on my family purohit’s insistence.

Idk if it’s common but Ive seen those people too.|||Of course it's a performance. What's wrong with a little act?  You can eat whatever you want. No one is going to stop you lol|||This is the ground reality check of Sanatan Rituals. Good that you raised the question. About a year ago i had to go through this procedure of 13 days for our Grandfather. I am listing Few things i had found then hope it helps:      1. Death in family can be caused with many reasons, so keeping the closest family members who shares the same house, same kitchen in a quarantine separated by cleaning with anti-bacterial natural cleaning ingredient like cow dung, ash, water - this separation for 13 days is for not communicating the disease, illness to other society members. Keeping safe distance is best way to avoid any unseen diseases.  2. Salt plays a different role in human biology - giving up salt will make you down, your metabolism decreases and your body becomes vulnerable - in this situation not having certain veggies, and food type are to keep your digestion system simple yet functional - a reminder that in life to be alive these basic things are enough for us to be alive and live.       3. For thirteen days the family members are kept in a separate space to grief, meditate, ponder meaning of life and foresee the ultimate truth - THE SATYA SANATAN.  There are certain Kriyas of Mediation to practice which is a tantrik secret and true Nepali Blood line Family members practice this till day. When you practice the kriyas you will understand why certain vegetables and food category are banned completly as you have to go inside of you in that meditation sessions -   inside of you remains the food that you ate days before are still there inside your belly - you can literally smell the days old food that you ate - imagine the smell of the vegges from inside your belly - it smells like a gutter - eWw - hence avoiding these certain types of foods to keep belly fresh that smells good when you go inside of your own body.   3.1 om shanti practinors, vaishnav, krishna Pranamis, are stirck on their diet because of this. RadhaSwami are a bit Flexible and OSHO is freaking flexible with eating rituals. But as the one goes deep inside of themselves automatically these certain food types will be avoided by the body naturally - it is a nautral process but done with reverse engineering i.e our body naturally avoids these food when we reach a certain level of being human.   4. In the garuna purana there symbolic stories where the path of enlightenment, practices and rituals are hidden - only the Nepali bloodline families know which part of the story signifies which practices and how to do it - ask Grand Parents - not as a causal question but by paying your attention, time and showing curiousness. they might feel pity and share it with you.       5. Early morning cold showers, one meal a day have tremendous positive side on how human body functions. There are supporting evidence and practices world wide.     6. People come together at this time even travelling from far away to show social mutal respect - mareKO bela ma pani BhetNa naJane -  is a taboo. You might feel like when s/he was alive people didnot cared much - true. No One can actually care for others - Aama Ba Lai kasto xa ? Sanchai Xa ? Budho hunaBhayo -yestai ho. Sewa gara, tei ho dharma bhaneko - kinda casual talks is all we get and its okay if you see it from the other side. What else you expect other to do for you and your closed ones ? you cant when it comes to other so others cant when it comes to you as well - it goes both the ways same same.   7. Different local communities have come together in Nepal to setup a KriyaPutri House equipped with decent facilities like toilets, water supply, anti-mosqutio space, safe place to be in for 13 days. This is a good initatives.       Our generation should raise questions regarding our doubts and dissatisfaction but we should be brave enough to dig in a bit deep to understand what going on really for thousands of years ? Why did it survived for thousands of years if these rituals are just bogus - rather then skipping this phenomenon as just another short video and SWIPE ->|||Lol just don't give a sht and do whatever u want, eat whatever one and wear whatever u want or change religion. 😂 We as strangers and the law ain't judging U|||Fr esai ni manche mareko grief, teskai mathi etro tauko dukhai.

Vanesi, maile barnu parne ho 10 din jati tara I never did.|||Its to detach you from worldly pleasures \\*maya\\*. Salt 'ras' is the epitome of maya. Idea is basically that this realm we witness with our senses is not all there is. Theres more to human life than constantly striving for pleasurable deeds.  Have a sense of truth.  If one develops attachment to something deeply in this material world than prepare to suffer one day. However if there is sense of detachment whilst you are part of the world than you will be able to  glide being untouched by the ups and downs of dualities.  Whole idea of cultures and traditions that we are brought up with in this  south asian central regions basically nepal and india is to instill individuals with the curiosity of truth. Whatever you do go beyond what your sense organs have to offer.  Find something that is permanent. And only truth for that matter is the answer.  And also from ayurveda perspective your digestion is tanked by sudden trauma. Just how serotonin is depleted and it controls digestion too. So you take easily digested meals.  Just a perspective.|||Some rituals of banning some vegetables is definitely stupid. But overally, minimising salt is good thing for a person to do especially stress due to lost ones raises overall bp, but obviously completely avoiding sodium isn't good. Eating fruits is also good for health. I used to think if someone close passes by, it's better to leave them some space. But it's kinda wrong as you need to surround yourselves with people this will helps lowering coristol. Obviously, people should also be supportive. One definite problem is it may be a financial burden to the family. |||Kabir Das rightly said,   जिंदा बाप कोई न पूजे, मरे बाद पूजवाए, मुट्ठी भर चावल लेके, कौवे को बाप बनाए।|||Andhabiswas le varieko desh|||I didnt quiet saw this in the comments so , everything about food restrictions is about diseases the food might carry and people visiting after death is not about paying respect to the dead person or anything , its about who remains, how they deal after the death of someone close.

Idk why this quote hit me after reading your third paragraph.|||Every ritual in the past has a reason, I am not supporting the blind follow up people do now a days. But people offer fruits as a sustenance to the affected family and remove the burden of cooking on their part. And one more reason is, our body starts decomposing within 24 hrs , if placed in a warm climate. The smell you get near a dead body is actually the body particles disposing into air. They spread everywhere, your house, utensils, every room and so on. So people are instructed to clean everything in the house as soon as possible. This also results in them not being able to use utensils at home to cook . The fruits offered are for sustenance and energy to go through the ordeal. Also most fruits are easy to digest and give good energy and fiber too.  But in modern times this doesn't make sense if a person expires in hospital or when we have food deliveries. But it is not easy to remove age old traditions at the drop of the hat because we got instant delivery. And these concerns might be valid in cities, but can we say the same regarding rural places ?|||It sounds rough but I have a theory.

First of all I'm not an expert but I can feel the necessity of doing rituals.  Simple as is said budha pakhale vaneko Mannu vancha ni as they have experienced most then us, instead of saying frustuation you could have asked about why is it necessary performing such rituals with you relatives or brahmins.  Main kura what I can feel is, if you have loved the person most who died you wouldn't have asked such foolishness. aafno lagi important manche ko lagi you cannot give 13 days, then I don't think you have loved them as you should have. Take a example if it's your partner that you love most, if needed ain't you gonna sacrifice your life for your partner?? Or you just selfish, Ill live alone and you may die?? Another important fasting reason for me is again think of it as like you broke up with your first love.. so how is it going to be for you for few days huh?? Mental problems, depression, suicidal thoughts aaucha in Esto if you really loved and you got recently separated.. so to avoid those think of this as a period that you are trying to build yourself up when the person you lived the most isn't around you anymore. You are trying to get strength from the level 0. These are just simple explanation for you to understand easily the necessity of rituals.  The main reason of rituals is something else. It goes like the Soul needs 13 days to fully leave from the earth. By performing rituals you are guiding the soul to the heaven. The fasting is not purification for you to cleanse up, it's still for the dead person.   Ani about your relatives coming bringing fruits, why. Are you mad bro?? Are you lonely your all life?? Just as you are saying it's hard for you to perform 13 days rituals how can you expect other relatives to come everyday looking up for sick dying people when every person is busy in their life.. be thankful atleast they showed up when needed..   Ewta important life lesson: janmida eklei janimye Pani manche katiko ramro thyo vanne kura mare pachi matra tha huncha.. even if you are born alone, dying alone is a really bad thing. Atleast marepachi malami Kati aayo vanda bujhnu sakincha how important that person was for all those people.

Culture provides us with the blue print as to the course of action to take during events like death. The brain hates uncertainty and during such events we would be utterly dumbfounded and paralyzed if we wiped out everything dictated by culture. We have formed societies and countries around us just so that we feel more secure and rituals help bolster the cohesion of the social fabric by getting us to coperate with one another.

And now since people are asking for some young faces Gagan found the right time to play this move.   If you look at those people who are there in \"youth congress\" or whatever it is called who are trying to set a narrative, they are kids of aristocrats and belong to a family who are politically inclined to Congress because that party has always prioritized them and their businesses.

He had been constantly rising voice against deuba and his associates, he openly criticized NC coalition in election and he also openly said he was against forming of government with UML but majority crushed him, left high level committes of netas created during NC-UML government (indicates he strongly opposed it). firstly have to know about him. Yes he is not the best, but among the choices in NC, he is best. He also ran against Deuba in samsadiya dal inside NC and lost to him(this was just after 79 election)  Everyone says he shows himself as saviour just before election (I gave some data before), yes he should be doing now. Before Gen-z he had been doing it in slow-process but when Gen-z happened he understood his pace is not good and increased his activity. Politics is also game of numbers, before Gen-z majority were aligned to Deuba or were scared of his cartels, but why he did only after Gen-z and 20yrs after being in politics is because,  1. it is only recently when he held substantial power in NC where his voice mattered. Before he was mere MP(there ary many of them) and didn't held any major post inside NC and held just recently. If he had done before, he would have been thrown out of party and this agenda wouldn't have been carried out by anyone. He would have been the BHIM RAWAL of congress. Watch in UML what happened, when one impulse guy, without any strategies and planning went all against Oli. He was thrown out of party yes, but that voice was also changed. 2. He did this after Gen-z(not to take anything with election, if election wasn't announced, NC would have done normal convention) because it was only this time when others were also not satisfied with the Deuba. He just lead this thought of people inside congress dissatisfied and mandate he got from Gen-z that your pace is not good, do decisive, we have heard enough of you. If gen-z wouldn't have happened, everyone would have been aligned with deuba himself, and Gagan didn't had number so, he would have lost the movement and got the punishment from the Leadership. He did this (risking his political career), slowly planning, making strategies and having sense, this time he wouldn't loose. **\\[which shows he has better planning ability to get the result he wanted and this is kind of ability everyone wants is their leader\\]**  Yes, he is not best, but what happening in NC is good. Old should also get filtered. Once this old were the present RaSwaPa and they happend to be this, we need perfect Check and Balance. If NC wouldn't have did this, RaSwaPa would have got much higher seat and they would have done whatever they wanted which is wrong. We want multiple stakeholders who listen and feels the general public and NC is being transformed to that and the man leading Gagan much respect to him.  btw, for this time, my vote is for Ghanti hai (still not best, but among alternative, good than others)|||Nepal doesn’t need another PM who learns governance on the job while the bureaucracy runs circles around them.

The multiparty system, built on the premise of democracy, was far more important for the country. Although it would have taken time for the system to function effectively and for citizens to truly practice democracy, it was a necessary and valuable process.  This system was destroyed through false promises, manufactured hope, and baseless allegations. By exploiting the corruption of a few politicians at the time, and instead of educating the people, innocent citizens were dragged into a civil war. The tourism sector once a key revenue generator collapsed, while agriculture, the backbone of the nation, was severely weakened.  As a result, the country has been pushed back by decades, losing entire generations of progress. All of this traces back to a corrupt process, influenced and engineered by foreign powers to weaken and destabilize the nation, and enabled by this one man. Today, the mass departure of citizens has become a major contributor to the economy through remittances an outcome born of necessity, not progress.  Yet many people remain unaware of these realities. One cannot help but wonder: when will people finally grow up and confront the truth?  And if he wins the election again, it should surprise no one.",

Probably because the party is heading towards breakdown and I am loving the scenario?

            "body": "My friend wanted to buy a cat. He went there with two friends, paid the money, and took a black male Persian kitten. He kept the cat for only one night, but his family did not want to keep it because of its black color. So the next morning, he took the cat back and asked for a replacement. Since it was the very next day and early in the morning, I don’t think it should have been a big issue for someone who is in this kind of business.  However, when he went there, the staff started making excuses. They said the owner of the café was in Australia and would probably return to Nepal the following week. When he questioned how taking his money was not an issue but replacing the cat was, they claimed that since he had kept the cat for 12 hours, it might have carried a virus, so they needed to keep it in quarantine for 10 days. Seriously?  They took his phone number but never called him back—for six months. The person involved is my friend; I met him when I was back in Nepal, and he shared this problem with me. I then called that café myself. They were extremely rude and showed no guilt about not contacting him or returning his money or replacing the cat. They simply said he could not get a new cat and must take the same cat, which was now six months old. On top of that, before taking the cat back, they demanded payment for the food they had spent feeding it. Seriously?  It is not my cat, and technically it is not my problem. My friend is an introvert and does not feel comfortable speaking up against wrongdoing. He is ready to accept that he chose to buy from scammers and got scammed—but is that enough? Don’t you think someone should raise their voice against such scammers?  So I am here to ask for a genuine suggestion: should I file a case, or should I just let it go and accept it as a bad experience?",

You can try for European countries. Especially Germany, the tuition fees in public universities is mostly free. **But you will have to learn German**, it is very very important.   Other European countries are also good, research about them. **Don’t go to UK at any circumstance**.  And lastly, If you want to go to India, go only for top tier private universities, **but it will cost upwards of 50-60 lakhs** for 4 years (colleges like BITS pilani, RVCE, etc). In my cases, India is better than European counties. And if you manage to get into top tier colleges that too into CSE, you will have a great future ahead.|||Same here bro .|||Private college haru ma scholarship paincha bhane jau.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially.

He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place. But please don't give up, gather your courage and try leaving this toxic relationship.  Maya ko naam ma aafno life barbaad nagarnus please. YO situation bata jasari bhaye ni niskinu try garnus.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious.

I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit.

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal. I’m posting because **interviews should never involve disrespect or humiliation**. Candidates invest time and effort, and basic professionalism should be the minimum standard.",

The plan was to hire 200+ people. But... We have stopped at 140+. The new employees make only slightly more than half of what I did when I started. So, pay has saturated too.   I am expecting to be laid off in the next 2 years. Why keep me to do something that AI can do? And why pay me 140k when there is a guy who would do it for 35k?   Basically, this sector is f***ed. Just read the min requirements, and observe the number of people who apply for the position. I am already preparing myself for DevOps and CyberSec position, and am specializing in the health domain. So... Guys... I don't want to scare you or anything. But... It is tuff out there.",

            "comments": "You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer. Maybe you need to level up your game.   Also, tech is passionate field. The whole reason you are being beaten down by AI already is you are here for money.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?

Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)?

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective.

He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.

Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र).

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

Rabi was obviously playing the long game, but Balen is also in it for the long run. If the RSP wins the election and Balen becomes PM, it could be a fresh start for the country. This is arguably the best outcome among all possible scenarios. The old political leaders will do everything in their power to silence RSP, but the main goal should be ensuring a fair election and the highest voter turnout possible.

Trying to get Balen, Ravi and Kulman to form a party so he can ride their coattail, which isn't working out so well.

He needs to question himself: why would someone pass a bill or law or provision that directly harms them?

On top of that, the whole Gen X/Y/Z framework is deeply American-centric and doesn’t translate to Nepal at all. Even if we try to create our own generational segmentation based on our political eras or developmental gaps, it still fails because people don’t exist in neat boxes. Socio-economic status, urban vs rural life, access to education, and lived experience all shape thinking. Yet we keep forcing lazy categories.

If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection.

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that. Refer bina kehi chaldaina vanera fail banaunu I selected one random cv and happy that he is doing good job.|||Always try to keep personal and professional life separate.

If you looking for real help, my suggestion is build your skillset - reach out to small companies based outside Nepal - US based sakey samma have great communication skills both written and speaking and get a job. Dont “network” its pointless|||I remember when my gf wanted to rent a flat and called the broker ,the broker was very professional at the beginning then slowly he STARTED calling my gf to inform about deals and such later he started  flirting with her ,ya we scolded that guy and he blocked my gf .|||We no friends, no gf, no job, no money type of male are relax in home haha|||i wonder where will nepal place if we made top 10 countries with most  pdfs i see them everywhere these days|||Start better to freelancing market. Try to refactor your code with AI tool. For reference section put if required, I will provide. I have not worked since 10 years here in Nepal. But still earning better money here in Kathmandu|||This is sad, yet the reality!!|||If you want I can provide you my mentor's LinkedIn.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

But what difference does it make? You want something from them and they want something from you. I see it as them doing the same thing as you. Reaching out in order to fulfill their needs. You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

I rearranged my professional commitments to attend what was scheduled as an interview. However, the call ended in **under 7 minutes**, without any meaningful discussion about my skills, experience, or past projects. There were no technical questions and no attempt to understand my background.  If a company feels a candidate isn’t a fit, that’s completely fair. But there are professional ways to handle it:  * Complete the interview and reject later, or * End early respectfully with clear communication  What made this experience particularly disappointing was the **tone at the end of the call**. The use of **dismissive language and slang** felt unnecessary and unprofessional, and it came across more as an attempt to belittle than to evaluate.  I was transparent about having another offer and ongoing interviews, simply as an honest update. After that, the conversation ended abruptly.  When I later shared feedback, I was told the interview was cut short due to “alignment concerns related to demeanor and expectations,” along with a generic *“sorry if it felt discourteous”* response. No actual accountability was taken for how the interaction was handled.  I’m not posting this because of rejection—rejections are normal.

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

Not worth wasting time.|||AIconf kasto thyo baru?|||I kind of get your point, but also see the value in the event. 350 for enterprise AI adoption is cheap. If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

Heard about it from someone close to his circle (someone from television), but could never verify.|||It interesting to see how hating on Shrinkhala has become like a cool thing and people are just like yeah  don't love her but yeah some of this is true. What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.

He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Most important part mero ahile samma ko Journey ma is Friend circle.  We all never compromised on education and took no shortcuts. Maintained scholarships, I had my priorities set to gain experience through internships and did undergraduate research on my field. Eventually found a job after college, currently working.

Did you ever consider going back to Nepal because of those challenges?|||Thanks u bro for inlightning us 🙏🙏|||Bhakhar bhakhar axu ma ni and all of this exactly resonates..bistarai na ta time xa na ta paisa,life monotonous. Yei cycle ma fasney vayo aba jasto lagxa. So what advice would you give in general|||As a student currently in US, I totally agree with this. Ma Software Engineering gari raxu undergraduate student. I came here in July 2024, now done with my 3 semesters 5 more to go. Mero first suggestion, stay away from universities ja dherai Nepali/international students haru hunxan. You will fuck up your study fs. Ali ali nepali students vako university with a good city or place nearby for growing opportunities vako location choose gara. Off campus job garera basxu nasochda ni hunxa, way easy to ruin your visa rn…very risky. If you have a good scholarship be here complete your studies, if you think you will grow more you can stay here natra you will have many options to leave US or go other place tara atleast you will get a good education and experience which matters the most. Main thing here is your friend circle, mero university ma I am the only Nepali student, aru koi xaina. I think I did a good thing by choosing this university, thorai distraction hunxa which helps me to focus more on my studies.|||American dream is quite tough right 👍|||Jati sakdo xito graduate vayera antai tira lageko ramro America is not the same as it use to be ma ni aako 2 barsa vayo ra kahile niskim bhaxa tara nepal farkera k garney tha xaina aru katai jau vane kata jau|||So almost the same as here for me.|||Yo post ma mostly negative aspects matrai cover bhayo. Aba positive side pani herna man xa. America ma padhda/ basda aaune opportunities, growth, ani ramra experiences ko barema pani ekta post aayo bhane balanced picture hunthyo.|||Don’t come to conclusion with just  one  example. Earlier I saw a post where a nepali guy had $80k in his portfolio while working as student. These both are extreme examples.The guy in this post came to USA to study bachelor with full financial and social responsibility. Doing bachelor is always tough while working illegally for 4 years. I don’t encourage people to go for bachelor degree with their sole financial responsibility. With more effort and research, people end up in scholarship and low tuition fee college. This will change the whole dynamic of this situation. However, the grass is not greener at other side too. There will be challenges related to immigration and getting green card. Anyone can come embracing those challenges and keeping open mind.|||Just know that this doesn’t apply to everyone. Perhaps many experience this but I didn’t and many around me didn’t.   When someone shares their experience in America they say it as if that’s what happens to all Nepalis. While a good majority might see this, not all do and that caveat is important. Not saying OP did the same, just putting the caveat.|||there are alot of opportunities in America. Its America for a reason. Things you said is happening alot but it’s a loop most people fall into. If padai ma dhyan deeyo vne you can apply for internship and apprenticeship and stuff. Take out time from work ani participate in networking and challenging events. Maile first two years kaam gardai hackathon hru join gare, networking events xodina, basically padna ra mehenat garna xodina study ma. Now I am working in a well funded startup. Senior year ma xu, 2 years vyo baira kaam na gareko. Its my AI Engineering job that feed me and I am completely out of the loop you are talking about. First two years was not easy but definitely its doable. Community college ko chakkar ma nalaagnu. Ramrari padnu. Opportunities lai wait na garnu. Earn from those off campus job but invest it in yourself and for attending those events that was gamechanger for me. Thats all I wanna say.|||[deleted]|||Bro mero full tuition scholarship xa jau ki nai, yestai kura like safety and all le na ja bhanxa ek maan le tara tya bhanda ramro opportunities aru katai xaina.

Arent they scared that they will get deported?|||You were/are confused. The education visa was never intended as a way to stay and work. Hence the immigration reform’s happening. USA loses $200 billion per year in outbound remittances from foreign workers. That money leaves the country permanently and helps to finance and support other nations who become reliant on those funds INSTEAD of developing their own infrastructure/economies. Those days are over.|||[deleted]|||Also in the US. Haven't faced most of those experiences above but what he said above is experienced by most. Avoid coming to the US for undergrad. Come for postgrad if possible in scholarships only.|||I did my higher education (including a PhD. in Stem) in the US. I put a lot of effort into studies, writing, publishing, and emerging as one of the future leaders of my field, but it took a lot of effort.   I miss home. I miss sitting around in a rooftop and sleeping in sunlight during the winter, I miss seeing stars at night, I miss gardening in our garden, I miss the smell of soil, I miss bhaili and dausi, I miss smaller festivals that I havent celebrated in years (e.g., maaghi), I miss the ridiculous amount of uphill walk to make it to my birthtown, I miss friends, and then I realize this is the story of sons/daughterz of every other home in Nepal.   It's depressing to think about. Life is just going to pass like this for this generation, and hopefully, the next generation will get to relax.|||100%|||you’ve worded it very well tbh and i relate to it a lot. might be a little discouraging but reality is almost always disappointing.|||One line always fascinates me: New York- the land of immigrants, the land of freedom, a place where cultures from around the globe meet together. One day, I hope to visit there on vacation.|||I think this is because the OP came at age of 18, i came here at age of 28 and i have different experiences, but one thing that is uncertain is Visa.  I agree with most part but I think it’s perspective, you are doing this struggle for yourself and people you care. Don’t do any bad things here obviously this is not Nepal, know the country, their rules and respect it, you’ll be fine.  Been here for almost 4 years now, got full time job after 1.5 years masters program. Pays ~150k annually, while this doesn’t help the feeling of living far from home country, but it pays for other stuff and you can get good car, buy own home, get better insurance and its set.  So my suggestion, get some experience in Nepal first, learn how to communicate, show up your skills and build your portfolio.|||Its tough for students and it always has been. Struggle is part of life. Consistency is the key i think.  Its always good to see positive side despite all hurdles and difficulties you have to face.||| “Padhera bhanda ni napadhi green card pauchan dherai le”  Please explain this.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

            "body": "Hello everyone, I need some guidance.  Maile yo pali BSc Microbiology maa join gareko chu (as a backup) and the college asked for my original migration certificate, which I have already submitted, because if i didnt, i would not be able to give exams and that would lead me to drop.  Now I am also waiting for CEE wrap-up, mainly aiming for BDS.  My confusion is:  \t•\tIf I get a college through wrap-up that is not under TU (like other affiliated universities), then I’ll need my migration certificate, so tyo ta nikalnu parcha, right?  \t•\tBut if I don’t get any college even in wrap-up, then I’ll be continuing BSc.  So in that case:  \t•\tIf I had already withdrawn my migration certificate, tyo migration k garne?  \t•\tWill I need to reapply for migration again, or can I continue BSc normally?  Basically, I’m confused about whether I should withdraw my migration now or wait, and what happens if I don’t get any college in wrap-up.  If anyone has gone through a similar situation or knows how this works in Nepal, please help 🙏",

Ani esto vaye pachi you go on talking with yourself ani most of the time you are talking yourself being angry and regret which will trigger depression. Timle real life ma ni notice garya holau, when you may have thought of reading, tetibela chai you will be getting out of your comfort zone to read where nervous system senses it as danger ani it will shut your system down ani procrastination huney type ko huncha.
