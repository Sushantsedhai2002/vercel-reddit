            "body": "I’ve been wanting to talk about something that’s been quietly frustrating me for a long time, and recent changes just pushed it over the edge.  I live abroad (Canada), and like many Nepalese here, I often get invited by friends to travel to the US for short trips, road trips, concerts, just normal things. Most of my friends have stronger passports, so for them it’s effortless. For me, it’s a completely different story.  Because I hold a Nepali passport, I have to apply for a US visa, wait years just for an interview, and now on top of that, new policies mean things like extremely short visa validity, single entry, and even deposit $15,000 financial bond. After waiting almost two years, it feels like the goalpost just keeps moving.      What makes it especially frustrating is knowing that many of these restrictions exist because of people who entered illegally, overstayed, or misrepresented their situation without considering the long-term consequences. Years later, those consequences don’t fall on them but on people who follow the rules, wait patiently, build legitimate lives abroad, and still get treated with suspicion simply because they share the same passport.  What hurts more than the logistics is the **emotional side** of it:  * The embarrassment of always having to say “I can’t, visa issues” * Feeling left out when friends travel freely * Carrying restrictions that are not because of *my* actions, but because of what *others* before me may have done  It’s frustrating that individual responsibility doesn’t seem to matter. You can be law-abiding, educated, settled, contributing to another country’s economy and still be treated as “high risk” purely because of where you were born.  Do you think this will ever change, or is it something we just have to accept?  Would really like to hear others’ experiences and thoughts",

Why does this feel niche  instead of world-famous? Because that article could just as easily have been about: Trail running Ultra-marathons Spiritual retreats High-altitude training camps Wildlife + jungle + mountain combo trips Culture + adventure hybrids  Nepal has all of this. Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism.

People are against development for their own selfish reasons.

I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Amazing nature and geography 3. Decent food  Cons: 1. Awful international airport 2. Terrible roads 3. Eating local food and drinking local water will make travelers sick 4. Polluted, cramped, chaotic, dirty cities 5. Garbage everywhere 6. No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.

I have also included a screenshot you can see, i listed a product of 1299 and got order from butwal so fulfillment cost was 125 rs and i provided about 6.5% as promo so 83 rs is deducted and the final amount i got was 1091 which is approx 1100 rs and only about 200 rs is deduced from my order which is a good i think if you compare daraz with commission and other fees.

I am currently studying Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Network remaining topics, some first paper contents like IQ/GK etc.   I know I am very near to completion of syllabus. I just need to work hard for few weeks like staying till 11:59pm, and waking up at 6am type shit for some days. That way I can finish the syllabus soon.  I will focus only on NEA and NTC syllabus. Please guide me how can I finish my syllabus faster?  NEA syllabus computer engineer:  https://www.nea.org.np/admin/assets/uploads/supportive_docs/41293547.pdf  NTC syllabus computer engineer:  https://cms.ntc.net.np/storage/media/k3c8rGrDGs9JlBfuVkuRariMV2hjyXuBkEr8l8lY.pdf   I have also applied for CDSC and Nijamati computer officer/engineer respectively. And thinking about applying for Gorkhapatra IT officer. I am not preparing solely for them but this I think is just increasing my syllabus to be never ending.",

Also, if possible:  · What’s a reasonable rent range for a place with reliable warm water in central/semi-central areas?  · Are there rentals where water isn’t a daily conflict?

            "body": "Hi everyone,   Sharing this so others don’t get fooled like I did.  I’m a Nepali girl working a 9–6 job. A few days ago around 7 pm, I was heading home on my scooter near Lagankhel. A girl suddenly crossed in front of me, so I slowed down. Then she started calling me and talking in English.  She said she is from China and had taken the wrong bus and needed to go to Banepa. She said she was alone in Nepal, had no money, and urgently needed around Rs. 4000 and asked me for Rs.1000 and said she will ask remaining money to others just as me to take a taxi. She fully convinced me. She kept saying she was scared and didn’t know what to do.  She even promised, “I will return your money tomorrow morning at 10 AM.”  At that moment, I felt bad and trusted her, so I gave her Rs. 1000.  I offered to book her a ride through Pathao/InDrive, but she refused and said she had bad experiences and needed to walk inside the highway area (around 50 meters), which sounded unsafe. I even offered to drop her on my scooter since I was going towards Bhaktapur (closer to Banepa/Dhulikhel side), but she refused that too.  Right after I gave the money, she asked for more, which already felt suspicious, so I refused.  Then something even weirder happened — she immediately took out a small paper and pen and asked me to write my name and phone number. The paper was tiny, just enough space for only my name and number, like it was already prepared. That honestly made it feel very planned and scripted.  Now I’m a bit scared thinking what if she misuses my name or number.  Two days later, I told my office dai about it. He said the **exact same girl (or same story)** approached him in Bhaisepati with the same dialogue, and he also gave her around Rs. 500. That’s when I realized it’s probably a scam.  This is honestly scary because they target kind people by acting helpless and alone.  Just sharing this so others don’t fall for the same thing:  * Don’t give cash to strangers with emotional stories * Offer to book a ride or help them contact authorities instead * If they refuse all practical help and only ask for cash, it’s likely a scam  Has anyone else experienced something similar around Lalitpur/Kathmandu?  Stay safe everyone 🙏",

She moved out because her father was emotionally abusive toward her mother, and things at home were very unstable. When she called the police on her dad during one of the fights, he showed them her psychiatric documents (she has BPD, diagnosed by a doctor), and the police didn’t take action.  She moved out and was living independently. She was in contact with her family almost every day so her parents and sister knew she was safe.  But a few days ago, her parents suddenly went to the police and claimed she was “missing,” even though they were talking to her regularly. She confronted them over the phone and said she wasn’t coming home and didn’t want to live with them anymore.  Yesterday she went to school (she’s finishing her last year), and her parents showed up there. They talked to her privately, and she texted me during that time saying they were trying to force her into a psychiatric institute. She even sent me the location of the place near budanilkantha.  After around 6 PM yesterday, she stopped replying entirely.  She has expressed suicidal thoughts before to her sister, but she has been stable living around me for the past month. No violent or harmful behavior, nothing unsafe that would justify forced admission.  I called the institute, but they said they don’t know anyone by her name. I don’t know if they’re lying or if she’s somewhere else. Her friends don’t know anything either.  I’m worried because she’s 21, legally an adult and can’t be forcibly admitted unless she’s an immediate danger which she is not rn. If she’s really there, they probably took her phone away.  and she hasn’t contacted anyone for over 24 hours.  I want to make sure she’s safe without escalating things or getting her into trouble. Should I file a general diary entry at the police? Should I push the institute for information? Or wait more?

And nobody questions it.  More serious is **milk and dahi**. In Lalitpur, loose milk and dahi often **smell bad and have no real taste**. Real milk and curd should smell fresh. . Milk is often adulterated by mixing **water, soda, chemicals, or starch** to make it thick and white. Cows are also given **too many antibiotics**, and that milk is unhealthy for humans.  Even **DDC (government-owned)** milk quality is inconsistent sometimes okay, sometimes it smells. Compare it with village milk, the difference is clear.  So who is responsible?

It might be true, might be not.  They’ll invest on your behalf and take 10% of the profit. They have a good team of share market experts. You can view all the share purchased on their behalf. 20/25% is too good to be true, i have invested around 10L which is the minm amount that needs to be invested. Let’s see what happens, even if they can provide 10-15% return, I think it’s a win.

Maile ta yo dashain Tihar maa ko Bich ma gold invest  gare|||90-95% dammm... That's a lot of savings i have heard in a while. Also that 3.65% is your normal interest rate or you already doing FD? Mine is 2.75% per annum.   What i try to do with my salary is... Save 50% enjoy with 25% and invest 25%. I found this method on the internet long time ago and tried my best to stick to it. Most of it gets spend on my clg fees or when doing big purchase like phone, laptop etc which in a way i believe is an investment / what you deserve kind of thing.   Then i invest 25% or sometimes more on the share market. I hope you are already filling IPOs at least as that has made me good money which i started 4-5 years ago. With secondary market also i have got 3X 4X sometimes 5X the bank interest rates returns over these years. (Currently in loss haha:) So i recommend you to start investing by learning about it first..   With savings alone.. i think you are privileged and doing better than 90% lol. So i wouldn't say that's not the smartest move. That's the safest way there is if inflation is not that bad in the future. All the other recommendations like start a business, invest in share market, real states or anything comes with a risk. Which might be worth a try as long as you are willing and able to bear the potential risks. |||Where do you work stranger ?

Maybe I am doing something really wrong way.  The question will be MCQ based and subjective based(first and second paper respectively).  I have recently joined coaching for NEA and NTC vacancies that cost huge amount of money.  And my speed has been increased thanks to the coaching. But the coaching is only teaching computer networks. And only its notes are made available. Other courses are not yet started.  I have personally finished: - dbms once but something might be missing depending on some syllabus. I am waiting for coaching's notes  - computer networks once but here again something might be missing i am going through coaching notes.  - software engineering  - operating system  - digital logic but only at surface level, some topics i need revision. I am waiting for coaching's notes.  I am currently studying Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Network remaining topics, some first paper contents like IQ/GK etc.   I know I am very near to completion of syllabus. I just need to work hard for few weeks like staying till 11:59pm, and waking up at 6am type shit for some days. That way I can finish the syllabus soon.  I will focus only on NEA and NTC syllabus. Please guide me how can I finish my syllabus faster?

The other 20%, you can increase your luck surface area by applying to more remote friendly companies and building relationships with founders/teams of the company you want to work for (there are many ways to do this).   It takes time and an unmetered motivation. It can be done. Good luck bro.|||someone ? everyone seems to have problem getting paid from overseas. just not the one who knows the direction to get such jobs ? how interesting.|||I myself have been doing remote jobs along with my Filipino partner, it's mostly about how you appeal the clients rather than just skills, i would say 80% of it is grabbing their attention and the rest is the actual work. There are people who are far above and beyond what I am in terms of skills but they suck at presenting their skills. If you want to know more about how you can land a client or employer listen to Pakistani and Filipino fellows out there, they are pretty good at this. Rather than targeting big companies, target small companies or even indie business people who are just starting out, you'll have a bigger chance. We have one doctor who's been paying us monthly for the last 3 years. It may certainly not be true to make about 3 to 5 thousand dollars from one employer but the good thing about is you can work for multiple ones simultaneously as long as it's not 9-5 or something like that.  Make yourself presentable and make yourself look like you know what you're doing and you're good at it. Approach as many companies or businesses as you can and don't be limited to just Upwork or LinkedIn and see the magic happening.  And also, don't be limited to just one skill , you gotta know a little about everything, at least make yourself informed about how things work. Most of the work can be done with AI agents as long as you know what you're doing. Cheers :)|||It's luck much times homie. I have been lucky sometimes and unlucky sometimes.",

PDF: Nepal is a landlocked country located in South Asia, bordered by China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. It is renowned for its dramatic geography, which ranges from the lowland Terai plains in the south to the towering Himalayan mountain range in the north, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world at 8,848.86 meters. Nepal has a rich cultural and historical heritage shaped by Hinduism and Buddhism, with ancient cities like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan showcasing centuries-old temples, palaces, and intricate wood carvings. The country is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, who was born in Lumbini around the 6th century BCE. Nepal follows a federal democratic republic system and is divided into seven provinces after the constitution was adopted in 2015. Nepali is the official language, but the country is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with over 120 languages spoken. Agriculture remains a major part of the economy, employing a large portion of the population, while tourism is another vital sector due to trekking, mountaineering, and cultural tourism. Despite its natural beauty and cultural wealth, Nepal faces challenges such as political instability, economic dependency on remittances, natural disasters like earthquakes, and infrastructure limitations. The devastating earthquake of 2015 caused massive loss of life and heritage sites, but the country has shown resilience through reconstruction and social unity. Nepal maintains a unique identity through its traditions, festivals like Dashain and Tihar, and its ability to balance ancient customs with gradual modernization.  # Questions I tested in the video  **Single-Chunk Question**   • What countries border Nepal?  **Multi-Chunk Question**   • Why is Nepal considered geographically diverse?  **Complex / Reasoning Question**   • How do Nepal’s geography and economy influence each other?  **Cross-Context Question**   • Explain how Nepal’s religious history contributes to its tourism industry.  **Hallucination Test**   • Who was the first king of unified Nepal?  The knowledge base is intentionally small so retrieval behavior is easy to observe.  # Tech stack  * **Frontend:** React * **Backend:** Node.js + Express * **Database:** PostgreSQL ( for user data) * **Vector DB:** ChromaDB * **LLM:** Gemini * **Embeddings:** Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  # Looking for feedback on  * Chunk size & overlap strategies * Better ways to handle hallucination detection * RAG evaluation ideas (precision/recall, answer grounding, etc.) * Any missing features you’d expect in a “real” RAG system  This is a learning project, not production — open to suggestions and critique",

Donot use p2p . User account will get locked 3. Use crypto card , a little costly but safe 4. If u have lot like more that 200k usdt , go to Dubai and cash out and open bank account there.and send small amount of money in nepali week after week. 5. If u have more than 1 million,  use Singapore bank account  . There are the best. 6.

What hurts is not just the trolling itself, but how normalized it has become. People comment things they would never dare say face to face—without thinking about the mental state of the person reading it. Even as a third person, reading those comments feels heavy.  Criticism is fair. Hate is not.  Humor is fine. Dehumanization is not.  Do we really gain anything by being cruel behind a screen? Or is it just easier than being kind?",

You’re not alone, even if it feels that way.|||Part of life ho, afno lagi work gara sabai kura haru normal hudai janxa|||Root cause of all this is 'inaction.'   Firstly, you have to quit social media for a while, since you don't have much achievements and the ones we will see there are our relatively successful peers, that's just asking to feel sad. Also, it's training your brain to be rewarded for no work and waste your time. So you have to quit social media to stop feeling like this and to not waste your time.  Next step, is simply just working on things you want to get or change(career & hobbies along, also don't forget to include early morning cardio to have great energy to work all day + strength training whatever time of the day you can), having fun with whatever you do(trust me everything can be fun, from carrying bricks to spend hours solving a single programming problems) and rest.  Trust me, this is all you need to do, consistently. To ensure you are consistent, remove distractions(especially social media ra porn, it'll just leave you craving for more) and frictions (make these things as easy to do as possible). Also, you need proper structure/routine, so daily k garney bhanera sochdai basnu naparos, feri tw sochnai ma time baarbad hunxa.  >I am withdrawing socially, even from friends i used to tolerate or like.  Doing this will slowly fade your touch of reality, so yeso once a week jasto yeta uti chowk tira kudi rakhney. Joining gym will also help you meet people daily, you can consider that.  >I feel lonely but drained by people at the same time. I want to live and be happy, not disappear.   You feel like that because of inaction and lack of achievements comparatively. So work consistently, you'll get to 'live and be happy.'  >I want to do hobbies, improve myself but motivation just isn’t there.  If you aren't actively doing anything right now. You can pick of things you used to like to do as a kid, most do find those enjoyable even as adults.|||Could I have a look at your birth chart?

            "body": "Good to know that people are slowly realizing the significance, I used to get downvoted when I used to say this few years back.  I'm not here to argue about the administrative expenses, cost ko matra perspective bata heryo vaney that would be very narrow-minded, tyo side bata matrai heryo vane I agree federalism is unnecessarry. But federalism is a practical reality, a necessary evil, a pragmatic necessity, it has strengthened the overall national unity.  If you remember all the chaos that used to happen before 2015, tyo chaos yetikai hateko hoina, chemistry ko bhasa ma vanda federalism (7 province) is where it reached an equilibrium state, stabilize vayo. Ck Raut jasto manche main-stream politics ma ayo.  If you are a party aspiring to lead the country, then you have to acknowledge federalism, irresponsible kura garna mildaina, you have to be responsible. Tei vayera top party haru kasaile federalism lai oppose gardaina. Tyo fringe, sano party haru le ho oppose garne, kinaki vandai ma k jancha, they don't have to worry about the mess, teti vanesi alikati popularity aucha.  Yo RPP ko neta haru Rabindra Mishra, Gyanendra Shahi, etc haru le irresponsible statement dida, I always think they're just bluffing... deep down they also know the consequences, it's easy for them to say cause they are not in power, place of responsibility. Let's say if they were to get the power to remove the provinces, they would probably chicken out. Cause removing federalism is like opening the pandora's box, the chaos that's gonna ensue might get out of hand.  Kathmandu-centric lense bata matra heryo vane, federalism seems unnecessary. But you look at it from the perspective of Karnali, Madhesh then you will realize the importance. Ma Koshi province ko manche, kati kura haru ko lagi ajhai Kathmandu janu parcha, why can't I just do it here in Biratnagar. The concept of federalism was good, Nepal over-centralized vayo, the concept was to create 7 Kathmandus, so that Karnali ko manche le Surkhet gaye pugne hos, tara tyo ahile samma implement vako chaina, kinaki center le ajhai pradesh lai constitution le deko rights deko chaina, laws pass gareko chaina.  Those of you who closely followed the formation of Constitution in 2015, you'll probably remember, suru ma 6 provinces pass huney wala thyo, province 6 was combination of current Sudurpaschim and Karnali. Tara Karnali river ko east side ma revolt vayo, they demanded a seperate state, so they seperated the west side of Karnali from the East. Ani last ma 7 province final vayo. And remember, province 6 was the first state to name itself (Karnali Province). Tei vayera yo federalism Madhesh ko  matra issue hoina, tyo West ma ni tetikai utheko ho, East ma ta jhan kati andolan vako ho.  That's why I liked it, when Balen instead of people-pleasing, he was blunt about federalism. RSP they had also realized from the start that mainstream party hunu mancha vane, you cannot deny federalism. They could have outright said that 'we will remove federalism' like RPP but they didn't. Tara suru ma chai people-pleasing garekai ho, manche ma dissatifaction popular cha, tei vayera tiniharule dili dally, willi nilly hanera... pradesh sabha(province assembly not province itself) hataune, directly elected CM wala funda gareko ho. Sarpa ni maros latthi ni navachyos type ko. They always made themselves seem on the fence on this issue on purpose.  Pradesh assembly hunu nahunu vanda ni, important chai Pradesh le afno rights payo vaney federalism strong huney ho. Jun neta haru le pradesh banayo, constitution ma rights lekhyo, tara tei neta harule laws haru ahile samma law pass gareko chaina. Tei vayera pradesh ramro sanga function garna sakya chaina, Pradesh ko afnai police hunu parne ho, cdo magna ktm janu naparne ho, etc. This is what Balen was talking about in that Janakpur Sabha. Good to see RSP ko ni line clear hudai cha yesma, Province assembly hatauna 2/3 majority chaiyo, tara Province lai rights dina majority vaye huncha, tei vayera main focus rights dina hunu paryo uniharu ko.

Personal recommendation: read the topics thoroughly, understand the details and write every single detail you see, ask why shit happens and why it works, re-understand it and note it somewhere again and again until shit becomes natural and makes sense. Then go to questions, easy to hard and skip the filler ones, only the ones you find to be necessary and dont do it step by step, just get the answer and if the steps make sense, you have understood it, when if you dont have much time for exams (like 1-2 days before exam and want to score good)    If you do have time, solve some model sets, old is gold, just like in exam-style or format in a loose sheet preferably under time constraint. It allows you to see any sort of loopholes in the question, or possibly exam pattern you can use to your advantage (works for subs like english and nepali mainly) and ask your teachers to check it.|||Book padh Muji vele",

Which generally provides Bachelor Hons program in BBA, BSc IT And BHM.  ​To be honest, I’m pretty nervous. I'm still in confusition regarding courses and Being a \"mature\" student after a long break is one thing, but there are a few other things on my mind:  ​The Cost: It’s costing about 8-10 lakh for the 3 years, which is a big investment.   ​The Pattern: The course follows a trimester system and assignments based. I’ve never studied this way before—is it hard to keep up?  ​Future Master’s: Since it’s an 3 years of Bachelor degree which equivalent to TU but, I’m worried about whether foreign universities will accept this degree if I want to do a Master’s later.  ​I have no experience with this type of international college setup.  ​Is anyone else in a similar \"affiliate\" program?  How are you finding the trimester workload, and do you feel the degree is worth the high cost?  ​I'd love to hear from anyone who started their degree after a gap!",

Dhanna le mero pariwar maa chai koi xaina loyal voter tin taauke ko, naa RSP supporter|||brainwashed bhako haina, Veda ni haina, our parents have seem wayy wayy more horrible situations, killing and what not, so a lot of them are desensitized on events of bhadra 8 and 9.    For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period.

There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

            "body": "I’ve been wanting to talk about something that’s been quietly frustrating me for a long time, and recent changes just pushed it over the edge.  I live abroad (Canada), and like many Nepalese here, I often get invited by friends to travel to the US for short trips, road trips, concerts, just normal things. Most of my friends have stronger passports, so for them it’s effortless. For me, it’s a completely different story.  Because I hold a Nepali passport, I have to apply for a US visa, wait years just for an interview, and now on top of that, new policies mean things like extremely short visa validity, single entry, and even deposit $15,000 financial bond. After waiting almost two years, it feels like the goalpost just keeps moving.      What makes it especially frustrating is knowing that many of these restrictions exist because of people who entered illegally, overstayed, or misrepresented their situation without considering the long-term consequences. Years later, those consequences don’t fall on them but on people who follow the rules, wait patiently, build legitimate lives abroad, and still get treated with suspicion simply because they share the same passport.  What hurts more than the logistics is the **emotional side** of it:  * The embarrassment of always having to say “I can’t, visa issues” * Feeling left out when friends travel freely * Carrying restrictions that are not because of *my* actions, but because of what *others* before me may have done  It’s frustrating that individual responsibility doesn’t seem to matter. You can be law-abiding, educated, settled, contributing to another country’s economy and still be treated as “high risk” purely because of where you were born.  Do you think this will ever change, or is it something we just have to accept?  Would really like to hear others’ experiences and thoughts",

            "body": "As someone who used to work at Tribhuvan University, I have closely seen and experienced what student unions stand for, so let me tell you something and share some events.  Most people in those student unions, except for very few, do not have any political ideology at all; all they are able to say is we need to develop the country, have better education, health, employment, infrastructure, and whatnot. So why are they putting so much time and effort into politics?  Simple answer: they get to experience some power and money.  Sometime ago, in our department, the student union of UML threatened the chief to sign documents for tender regarding the purchase of computer equipment. Everything was recorded in video by the chief and we can clearly hear the chief saying it hasn't gone through the process and he doesn't know the quality and details of the purchase, and the response from the student leader was \"Ahile sir yaha kurchi kurchi uthayera hannu naparos...maile vanesi mannu na...sign garnus...tapailai paxi kei man parena vani hami saman nai change garamla....kei farak pardaina...ahile sign garnus...garo banaunu vayo vani hamlai ni garo huna aauxa...tauko tauko ma chair le hannu naparos.\" The campus chief signed. The video became viral over social media in our campus groups, Tribhuvan University asked for clarification, and that is all - no other action taken. The reason for making him sign the document? So that they can purchase lower-quality equipment and put extra money in their pocket.  This other story is of few years back, a professor who worked in USA finally returned to Nepal and he wanted to make a lab at Trichandra campus. When he didn't agree to give commission to NSU (Congress student union) while purchasing spectrometers, they grabbed the old-aged professor from campus and beat him on the road with their legs. This happened less than 300 meters from KTM Police, Ratnapark. He had to be admitted in ICU. And of course, the students got away with no consequences. I think they later told that the cause for beating was increasing college fee.  They also do some good work like speaking for students and speaking against bad decisions of campus administration but doing the comparison, it just feels like they just do the good works to hide their actual intentions. If they get commissions regularly, they stay silent but when they don't get money, they start protesting. Most importantly, they are not hesitant to be violent as they know if they get arrested, it will be for a short period of time, and the police will release them after political pressure. I remember a few UML students even beat up police on dress while drunk a few months ago.  They also slowly transition to national politics and this is what they want to do later on. They want to show as if they are doing works but the only reason is to get commissions.  And this is true not only for these two student unions, it is also true for most of the political associations, including those of professors, students, and employees. Every group forms a political association, and in order for everyone on a committee to agree on something, they have to receive something, leaving not enough money for actual works. This is why we have low quality stuffs, and this is why things take so long to be done. This is why they are able to afford good lifestyle without job being student for decades. Remove the money and freedom to be 'gangster who doesn't get intervened by police' from equation and I wonder how many students will be left in those student unions",

If you believe Gangan’s “Naya party” Congress will move to ban these student unions. Congrats you failed. RSP doesn’t have any unions yet and Sumana tried to get these unions out last time as well.|||I also have closely seen students unions and their functioning over a sustained period of time and the thug activities that they perform are undeniable. The political culture and the intent of a lot of those members of student unions are there just for the power exercise as you say. They have been very bad and might continue to be bad. I have had worst possible experience from those unions personally too, so I am not vouching for these activities and completely agree the lawlessness they tend to follow.  But in principle I do think that they have some good purpose to serve, if done properly. I think there are two ways about it:   1. Because they are bad, let's ban them willy nilly.   2. They are bad, but they serve  good purpose in general, so lets think about possibly improving them.  The first one seems easy way out, lets work to ban them altogether. But how? Do we ban students getting together and discussing? What if they don't explicitly say they are party association, the association isn't something that you can prove. Beause unionization, we think,  is something a democracy should allow, does banning them amount to restricting democratic right? This could be a slippery slope and we might never be able to pin point a boundary for them to unionize and associate with some political party, because in principle we can't ban having political viewpoint.     The second seems a bit more ideal. We want to weight in the possible cons compared to the pros that they offer. And, I think if done well, the pros have something good to offer. So in principle I wouldn't ban unionization (students or otherwise). If we have strong criminal prosecution and strong adherence to laws of campus (in case of student unions), we can improve situation a lot. I think that thuggery is not unique to unions but is prevalent in more areas of society and we can't ban them all. Its just the reflection of society and some campus can control  them more some don't.      I have also seen some very good deeds done by the student unions personally, across different student unions. And at times, I have been impressed by what can be achieved by the unionization of student, if done with correct motive.      And lets get real, no one is going to ever ban any sort of unionization be it students or workers or else in a democracy. I have some people think RSP would ban them; they won't.|||Thank you and this presence of student unions in our public education system is a huge problem and if any party can decrease their influence then it is RSP which has no student unions. Gagan led NC won’t do it because he believes in such unions.|||Nepal's Top Uni TU, nothing to be proud of. Poorest at every level.    Few blocks of very old building here and there without any safety and hygiene.    Most of the Professors don't care, they take orders from their parties, they are very arrogant of their degree and don't give time to students.|||Instead of banning them, making them face their consequences would do greater good, is what I think. Imagine if the students who beat the professor were charged with assault. Now that would be the consequence. This would stop evil. We need unionisation for the good things. For the bad things, there should be consequences.|||This so called student union died the day they kept quite when Students were dying in the streets.|||Vanna lai chai sabaile ban student unions vanxan tara sabai naramro hudainan some people actually help students and don't ask for money from the college .

With the sole exception of Baburam Bhattari, and the late BP Koirala, I don't think anyone even knows about any of the political ideologies.   Communism, Capitalism, Socialism, the tradeoffs between each of these, these are a very complex subjects of political and economical nature, people literally do PhD, and spend their whole life on these things, and you think these illiterates, and these corrupt politicians of our country know these ideologies?",

Even the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, they were able to rebuild the fastest after the earthquake from their own funds. There are also many other good initiates in Bhaktapur. Bijukchhe also gave up his MP seat to someone else in the party so that's good too. They have a lot of youth representatives running for election too, I think it's just behind RSP and certainly a lot ahead of Nepali Congress, UML, etc.  As for downsides, they do restrict some things in Bhaktapur, such as INGOs do not have the same access they do in other places. Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party. With the work they've done in their area, they could have promoted them and tried for more seats in other areas but they don't seem to put any efforts towards that, leaving them with extremely limited seats.   We know their MPs have mostly speak out in the parliament with a good voice. Although I think the impact is limited.|||They are limited to a specific area, mainly competing in Changunarayan and Bhaktapur municipalities. Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.|||Visited North Korea|||[Here's his interview with gorkhapatra](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010090943/http://gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=29063&cat_id=29)|||How is not letting ngo work a bad thing?

An MP’s real job is lawmaking. They are supposed to make good laws, fix bad policies, question ministers, and make everyday life easier through reforms. Development projects are planned and built by ministries, local governments, and the National Planning Commission. MPs can only request or pressure for budget allocation. They don’t actually build anything. Because of this confusion, MPs spend more time cutting ribbons than making laws. We then complain about weak governance and bad policies. Surprise. If we want real development, maybe we should start judging MPs by the laws they pass, not the roads they pose next to. What do you think?",

They more likely talk about \"yesle yeti budget lyayo, ani yo banyo, tyo banyo\"|||Okay again...   MPs arent for laws only. There are committees which draft the laws. There are many parliamentarian who diesnt get in those committees.  So what they do?  House of representatives means representatives of ur problem. Where the lawmaking responsibility is given. The local government arent all equal. Like my constituency which is rural cant sustain itself from the municipal budgets. Cause being rural means there will be low taxes. And essential infrastructure like pitch roads, water supply, and even construction of hospital infrastructure and major high school can only by done by federal and provincial budgets.   Now. What does ur representative do? He goes to ministry or NPC and bring ur problem. \"Khanne pani xaina... k? Mero constituency ko janta pani nakhai kina marney ho?????\"... then the ministry direct budget to ur constituency under the MP's jurisdiction or collective MPs project.   Thats how it works. Timi municipal budget ma matra focus gareu bhanney.. none of he municipal government beside ktm and pokhara and biratnagar will sustain itself. (Even bharatpur cant).  So dont look at them just as lawmakers but also representatives. Their work will determine if budget goes to ur constituency or not. Hope it shed some lights.  There is no equally distribution.... 165 constituency mai budget badyo bhanney.. it will not work. As in pugdaina... and there is no saving.. auta fiscal year ma nasakako budget gets returned back to treasury and redistributed again... So MPs is lawmaking and also budget bringing as they bring ur problem to ministry and ask for budgets....",

            "body": "Hi everyone,   Sharing this so others don’t get fooled like I did.  I’m a Nepali girl working a 9–6 job. A few days ago around 7 pm, I was heading home on my scooter near Lagankhel. A girl suddenly crossed in front of me, so I slowed down. Then she started calling me and talking in English.  She said she is from China and had taken the wrong bus and needed to go to Banepa. She said she was alone in Nepal, had no money, and urgently needed around Rs. 4000 and asked me for Rs.1000 and said she will ask remaining money to others just as me to take a taxi. She fully convinced me. She kept saying she was scared and didn’t know what to do.  She even promised, “I will return your money tomorrow morning at 10 AM.”  At that moment, I felt bad and trusted her, so I gave her Rs. 1000.  I offered to book her a ride through Pathao/InDrive, but she refused and said she had bad experiences and needed to walk inside the highway area (around 50 meters), which sounded unsafe. I even offered to drop her on my scooter since I was going towards Bhaktapur (closer to Banepa/Dhulikhel side), but she refused that too.  Right after I gave the money, she asked for more, which already felt suspicious, so I refused.  Then something even weirder happened — she immediately took out a small paper and pen and asked me to write my name and phone number. The paper was tiny, just enough space for only my name and number, like it was already prepared. That honestly made it feel very planned and scripted.  Now I’m a bit scared thinking what if she misuses my name or number.  Two days later, I told my office dai about it. He said the **exact same girl (or same story)** approached him in Bhaisepati with the same dialogue, and he also gave her around Rs. 500. That’s when I realized it’s probably a scam.  This is honestly scary because they target kind people by acting helpless and alone.  Just sharing this so others don’t fall for the same thing:  * Don’t give cash to strangers with emotional stories * Offer to book a ride or help them contact authorities instead * If they refuse all practical help and only ask for cash, it’s likely a scam  Has anyone else experienced something similar around Lalitpur/Kathmandu?

Just recently, around the time of Madhesh andolan, people still viewed the hill people of places like darjeeling as Nepali and the people of Madhesh as Indian.

It is not a deep cultural bond yet but the bond gets stronger every day. I am sorry to have brought this political issue into something personal that you faced. I too hope people see beyond race for a better Nepal. Cheers.|||I don't hate or discriminate Madheshi because I'm also from Terai lol 😆. Jokes aside, I don't call myself Madhesi, I think we should call ourselves Maithili People or just Terai people.   The disdain people have towards us is because they don't like Indians (biharis and up and other Indians in general). And, people can't just seperate us from Indians by just looking at us, and that's the main reason.   As a matter of fact our terai people aren't also any less racist, it's just that Terai people go to Kathmandu or other places for work or studies so they have more stories of racism.   Last year my friends from Kathmandu visited Janakpurdham and they face racism there. I think most non Terai people don't travel to terai region and that's why they don't have much stories of racism.   I think people are just slightly racist and xenophobic to some extent.

BJP's IT cell is strong and they harass people personally for their views, for their opinions. I see same thing happening in Nepal recently. People are being attacked with baseless accusations, for their views and opinions.  Binayak Kuikel was attacked for something he isn't here on reddit only , not for his opinion but because of a photo. He was accused for being some party's IT cell or core member , and the guy who attacked didn't spend 2 minutes to research what the photo was about.   Binayak is only an example. People here on reddit or any other social media are attacked baselessly because of some opinion they gave. Is this the new political culture we were trying to spread? Yes old parties didn't do right and created a bad political culture, but the new ones were supposed to be better isn't it? I hope this stops. We need to do better.",

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning.

Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

            "body": "I used to always wonder how some people are smart. I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you can become one.  I love this tweet by Brian Norgard: “The smartest people in almost every field have a physics background.”  Aristotle, Newton, da Vinci, Richard Feynman, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Jim Simons, Geoffrey Hinton, the list goes on and on. If you actually check the background of smart people, most of them are good at logic, which comes from math and physics.  Physics teaches you what is true. It is simply the search for truth. For now, physics is the highest form of truth we have. It might be something else in the future, but that doesn’t matter. By studying physics, you’re basically studying how everything works.  Back to Jim Simons: “You can teach a physicist finance, but you cannot teach a finance person physics.”  After becoming good at physics, you can learn anything, because you’ve already tackled one of the hardest things.  Math teaches you how to think. If you want to learn physics, math becomes necessary, because without it you can’t learn physics. That’s where the importance of math comes in.  Other examples are engineering and computer science. These subjects revolve around the same ideas as well.  Basically, you build your foundation on science. These subjects teach you to think logically and critically, and most importantly, they force you to see the world from a different angle.  That’s it. You just learned the secret to become smart. You’re welcome.  Essay inspired by [Scott](https://share.google/ShBJhO7M70xdglnT4) Adam.

Honestly, I'm sure your platform doesn't do it better in that regard. Who's going to use it? For what?  If you care about usability, just release the datasets (with doi or something). I'd just want the data APIs/ structured data. If I'm using it for training, I couldn't care less about the interface. Or better yet, preprocess, shuffle, and give the train-test-validation splits. Maybe a couple benchmarks with your analyst background.  Your project is scattered- you claim it does election intelligence, disaster and env monitoring, news aggregation. To me, it sounds like 3 different domains. To me, personally (not saying I'm representing your potential userbase), the site has no utility.

            "comments": "Just become expert in One language/framework no one will replace you.... Good engineer can use AI in proper way, Vibe coders don't know how to things works or how to scale things... it's just a hype|||From what I have seen from a hiring perspective, you definitely won't get past the initial round if all you know is vibe coding. Writing code is just one of many things that engineers do. There is a lot of designing, planning, presenting possible options to higher management, beaurocracy, compliance and risk assessment involved in the process. And then comes the hard part -- debugging errors and bugs, and good luck with that if you're just sitting in the chair writing prompts. AI is good at finding solution with the historical training data, but sometimes you come across problems and situations that nobody else has gone through, or no resource / solution is available in the internet. Pilots use autopilot for the most of the time during the flight, but the whole purpose of having skilled pilots in the cockpit is for them to be able to detect anamolies if any, and be able to take over if need be. Relying on vibe coding without knowing the internals is like someone flying a plane relying on the autopilot without knowing much of how to fly a plane.     However, if your plan is not to be an engineer but to boostrap something and sell it, then that's a little different.|||brother, focus on the basics. don't believe the hype - vibe coding in production apps is disastrous. you NEED to understand every line of code that AI generates, find flaws, test and refactor and you can't do that unless you know how to write good code.|||There is nothing like Vibe coding. It's just a mind virus🙃. It will destroy the potential good engineer inside you if you start vibing.|||Vibe coding is good if you want to start your own startup and earn in the future. killer to start any thing.   But it’s bad if you’re applying for a job. companies will easily poooo over your CV, degree, or vibe-coding projects in your portfolio.  Just check r/HTML and r/CSS—why are they still so active? Outside of real work, people keep asking tiny, tiny questions that can be done in minutes using any modern grid builder or page builder. Yet they insist on learning everything from scratch.  I’m mentioning HTML/CSS because I’m a CSS developer.|||CFBR|||if what you are saying is true then what value will this information technology degree even have. (i am coping)|||From experience - Honestly, if you can write code properly without relying too much on “vibe coding,” do it. Once you start depending on it heavily, you might slowly forget real syntax and how to structure code yourself. I’m not saying you should never use vibe coding, just try to keep it minimal and use it in moderation.|||You have to ultimately become a good debugger than a coder. My suggestion for you is to explore systems / frameworks / patterns while you vibe code but learn DSA to the core, after all it is what gets you a job. a project to show and some programming skills to hide you vibe coded.       My say about the career as a whole, it is very uncertain that software engineering will last after 5 years. Companies are already looking for senior only roles, next it would be architect only roles, who knows.|||Watch lectures and take notes. When AI gives you code, make sure you understand it. Moreover, download the repo from GitHub and try to understand the complex architecture without the help of AI. If you can do this, then only you can switch to vibe coding...|||I think coding as a whole is taking in some massive changes, and I firmly believe that you should use coding tools for any programming job.|||Focus on software engineering rather than writing code, noone will value how well you remember the syntax of a particular language anymore, you should know it for sure. But don't get too involved in it.   Previously we used to see programming as a compiled interperated language, which still is true on a fundamental level. But now it's become more about building Lego building, you should be more focused on which block to add or remove and less about what is inside a block,   Example: you have to make calculator   Previously: know how to do c=a+b for sum. C=a*b for mul,  Now,  Create add, multiply, divide, subtract function, take user input, know the operation. Operands and operators  These are the building blocks.   Being said that. Knowing the fundamentals is as important, the use of actual CS background comes into play when you are designing the blocks to give less ambiguity to AI to hallucinate. See it as, you are a civil engineer doesn't mean you join each bricks ylby yourself. You instruct !|||Whatever you do, understand the code (in core level). And you should be confident enough to code without copying or looking in 80% case.|||Do vibe but first you must know basics, syntax and flow of your tech stack",

Mine is 2.75% per annum.   What i try to do with my salary is... Save 50% enjoy with 25% and invest 25%. I found this method on the internet long time ago and tried my best to stick to it. Most of it gets spend on my clg fees or when doing big purchase like phone, laptop etc which in a way i believe is an investment / what you deserve kind of thing.   Then i invest 25% or sometimes more on the share market. I hope you are already filling IPOs at least as that has made me good money which i started 4-5 years ago. With secondary market also i have got 3X 4X sometimes 5X the bank interest rates returns over these years. (Currently in loss haha:) So i recommend you to start investing by learning about it first..   With savings alone.. i think you are privileged and doing better than 90% lol. So i wouldn't say that's not the smartest move. That's the safest way there is if inflation is not that bad in the future.

PDF: Nepal is a landlocked country located in South Asia, bordered by China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. It is renowned for its dramatic geography, which ranges from the lowland Terai plains in the south to the towering Himalayan mountain range in the north, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world at 8,848.86 meters. Nepal has a rich cultural and historical heritage shaped by Hinduism and Buddhism, with ancient cities like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan showcasing centuries-old temples, palaces, and intricate wood carvings. The country is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, who was born in Lumbini around the 6th century BCE. Nepal follows a federal democratic republic system and is divided into seven provinces after the constitution was adopted in 2015. Nepali is the official language, but the country is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with over 120 languages spoken. Agriculture remains a major part of the economy, employing a large portion of the population, while tourism is another vital sector due to trekking, mountaineering, and cultural tourism. Despite its natural beauty and cultural wealth, Nepal faces challenges such as political instability, economic dependency on remittances, natural disasters like earthquakes, and infrastructure limitations. The devastating earthquake of 2015 caused massive loss of life and heritage sites, but the country has shown resilience through reconstruction and social unity. Nepal maintains a unique identity through its traditions, festivals like Dashain and Tihar, and its ability to balance ancient customs with gradual modernization.  # Questions I tested in the video  **Single-Chunk Question**   • What countries border Nepal?  **Multi-Chunk Question**   • Why is Nepal considered geographically diverse?  **Complex / Reasoning Question**   • How do Nepal’s geography and economy influence each other?  **Cross-Context Question**   • Explain how Nepal’s religious history contributes to its tourism industry.  **Hallucination Test**   • Who was the first king of unified Nepal?  The knowledge base is intentionally small so retrieval behavior is easy to observe.  # Tech stack  * **Frontend:** React * **Backend:** Node.js + Express * **Database:** PostgreSQL ( for user data) * **Vector DB:** ChromaDB * **LLM:** Gemini * **Embeddings:** Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  # Looking for feedback on  * Chunk size & overlap strategies * Better ways to handle hallucination detection * RAG evaluation ideas (precision/recall, answer grounding, etc.) * Any missing features you’d expect in a “real” RAG system  This is a learning project, not production — open to suggestions and critique",

He portrays Sobita as a threat to Renu and clearly suggests that Renu should win. He even says that Sobita’s husband would not vote for her.

However, he does not mention Sobita’s strong background in law, even though the primary role of a Member of Parliament is to make laws.  Look at his thumbnail: “Jeet” is written under Renu, and “Haar” is written under Sobita. This is not just a coincidence.

I stayed until they came outside, I was shocked they were plus 2 or 10 class students in college/school dress. I mean doing such thing, in somewhat public space with no fear.  I mean wtf. Is this normal today? Doing that at a young age and in a unsafe place like that? I even coughed and knocked the table to let them know that someone was noticing, but no they kept going.  They looked like Madhesi, I am not being racist here but anyone else would be too scared to do that shit in public. I mean go find a room if you are that desperate or go to some cave idk .  Edit: Watching possible minors engage in that behavior in a public space shouldn't be traumatizing? No wonder there’s something deeply wrong with today’s society.     Edit 2: I didn't realize while writing this, \"Trauma\" maybe is a very heavy word. I was deeply shocked, but I recognize that using the word “traumatized” can diminish the weight of real trauma, which isn’t what I intend. Cheers and lmao",

You know why people are hating on you, especially after that Excel sheet fiasco you did. I thought she would at least hold off for some time, but it looks like she didn’t. I mean, the apology video she made came out so soon after the protests, and then again, there’s this show.  Honestly, just use your money, shut everything down, go to Switzerland or somewhere, and relax.  And yes, it is sad that her house and childhood home were damaged by the protestors.

            "body": "Lets not forget how shitty Nepali Congress can be when it comes to protecting their gunda student netas. Remember Prem Chalaune, the sociology prof at Tribhuvan University?  Back in Oct 2020, NSU thugs (that's NC's student wing) locked up his department over some political bullshit protest. When he tried to unlock the tala to get classes going, they jumped him with iron rods and sticks, beat him so bad he had a fractured leg, head wounds, and was left bleeding on the street. He said in interviews they only stopped when other people on the street showed up, otherwise, he'd be dead for sure.  And our so called Yuwa Neta **Gagan Thapa?** Dude was silent as a mouse until everyone started tagging him on Twitter and pressuring him hard. Only then he spoke a lil about it, tyo ni last moment ma, but come on, his own party's goons did this!   Now his IT cell is out here whitewashing NC's image, hiding crime like this to make them look clean for votes. But hey, Gagan fans, why cant you critisize your party where its wrong? Just yesterday, thier KTM 4 candiate Sachin was comparing Gagan to Ram lol, like he's some silent god, but wait, \"Ram\" was dead silent and didnt utter a word when his own predecessors from student union beat a teacher almost to death. Hypocrisy much?  This is the kinda impunity NC breeds, government even tried to drop the case in 2023, **forcing Chalaune to hunger strike for justice.** Yes, Hunger strike ma basnu pareko thyo, can you imagine?   Court finally convicted the 6 goons in 2023 (upheld 2025), but two fled abroad with fake docs. Yes fake docs. In December 2024, Professor Prem Chalaune wrote formal letters to the **US Ambassador** (Dean R. Thompson) and the **Australian Ambassador** (Leann Johnston). Chalaune specifically alleged in these letters that they used fraudulent documents to flee while their cases were still sub judice (under consideration by the court).  If NC wins again, expect more of this thug politics ruining our unis and lives. Vote smart, dont let them fool you.",

I'm still in confusition regarding courses and Being a \"mature\" student after a long break is one thing, but there are a few other things on my mind:  ​The Cost: It’s costing about 8-10 lakh for the 3 years, which is a big investment.   ​The Pattern: The course follows a trimester system and assignments based. I’ve never studied this way before—is it hard to keep up?  ​Future Master’s: Since it’s an 3 years of Bachelor degree which equivalent to TU but, I’m worried about whether foreign universities will accept this degree if I want to do a Master’s later.  ​I have no experience with this type of international college setup.  ​Is anyone else in a similar \"affiliate\" program?  How are you finding the trimester workload, and do you feel the degree is worth the high cost?  ​I'd love to hear from anyone who started their degree after a gap!",

Personal recommendation: read the topics thoroughly, understand the details and write every single detail you see, ask why shit happens and why it works, re-understand it and note it somewhere again and again until shit becomes natural and makes sense. Then go to questions, easy to hard and skip the filler ones, only the ones you find to be necessary and dont do it step by step, just get the answer and if the steps make sense, you have understood it, when if you dont have much time for exams (like 1-2 days before exam and want to score good)    If you do have time, solve some model sets, old is gold, just like in exam-style or format in a loose sheet preferably under time constraint. It allows you to see any sort of loopholes in the question, or possibly exam pattern you can use to your advantage (works for subs like english and nepali mainly) and ask your teachers to check it.|||Book padh Muji vele",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead.

No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account.

Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine.

So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र).

They understand that increase in supply lowers their own wages (and opportunities).   Not saying they are right in removing the ladder from other immigrants. But just sharing their perspective.|||Hmm generalizing blatantly. So typical.   I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.

Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.

The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states.

For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner?

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

In the post, she mentions:  \"अपराधीलाई उन्मुक्ति दिन कानुन आउन लागेको रहेछ तपाईँले त्यसको विरोध गर्नुभएको रहेछ, संसद्मा तपाईँको प्रस्ताव फेल भएपनि आम नेपाली युवा तपाईँको साथमा छ है भनेर धेरै फोन, म्यासेज प्राप्त भइरहेका छन्, जसले पहिलो पटक संविधानले एउटा सांसदको रूपमा दिएको जिम्मेवारीमा नागरिकहरू सचेत हुनु भएको भन्ने महसुस गराएको छ।\"  Look how shamelessly Gagan is against that \"**Birodh ko Suchana**\". Do you expect this guy to do anything good? He will not do anything against his dear, corrupt party leaders like: **Deuba Dai, Bhauju, Khand, Nidhi, Gacchedar, Mahat, Binod Chaudhary**, etc.  Here is the link: [https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1CqddzdF7d/](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1CqddzdF7d/)  *Defend this Gangane ko jholeys.*",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?

            "body": "It’s high time that students should start thinking about alternate career options instead of blindly chasing IT jobs.      First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Then comes the mandatory grind:   DSA, LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, System Design, OOPs, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks.      Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.      And now the new wave:   AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Vector Databases.      After all this…   You might get a job.   But there’s no guarantee you’ll survive in the long run.      AI is evolving faster than most people can upskill.   Tech stacks change. Roles disappear. Expectations keep increasing.      IT is no longer a “safe” career.   It’s a constant race with uncertainty.      This isn’t fear-mongering...it’s reality.   Students should seriously explore alternate paths where AI supports you, not replaces you.      Think long-term.   Don’t just follow the crowd.     Found on X",

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt.

Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"?

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype. Otherwise, we risk mistaking short-term popularity for genuine leadership|||Balen will win for sure |||सबका सब हामीलाई वेवकुफ बनाईरहेछ… बाले भाईले पनि बनायो।|||Isnt RSP against provincial system.|||But wtf is he saying ? 😭",

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

It will open multiple doors for you not just one country and programme which you are doing rn, Germany vayena vane k garnu type hudaina. Also try and apply as much scholarship opportunities you can find over the internet like DAAD, Hungarium Stipendum, Denish Govt Scholarishp and many more out there, if you are good in essay writting, some ECA in your school time, good social profile like involving and working in Rotaracts or Red Cross, good spoken English, can attend interview then you have very high chance that you can get good scholarship opportunity. Same time try countries like ITALY or Austria where you can get free undergrad programmes in Public unis (dont go to consultancy 8-10lakh lutchan).
