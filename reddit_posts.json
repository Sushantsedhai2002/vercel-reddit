The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||Just coming home from the match, surreal experience.

No evidence of direct orders. No witness of orders. We hate KP Oli so much that we want him imprisoned straight and we are equally biased too. Meanwhile Sheikh Hasina directly ordered for utilization of lethal drones and weapons. State Police pleaded guilty and assisted the court by becoming witness and testified against Hasina.

If this was a coalition of popular politicians i.e Balen, Harkay e.t.c  instead of a bunch of political nobodies, they could've dragged KP Oli to the court.  Enough human rights were violated to land Oli in jail for a long time.|||Sheikh Hasina and KP Oli are different. We didnt have secret prison or crackdowns and arrests (not that we know of). Bangladesh had month long protests. Her reign was generational.|||There is no legit proof to blame oli. People are not ready to see any other POV other than thinking he killed everyone .But he should have taken responsibility for whatever happened as the PM.

            "body": "I started teaching a Grade 12 girl Physics and Math from middle of Kartik. I taught her with full effort. I explained every concept, every formula, and showed her how to solve questions step by step. When I revised with her, she could answer. So I thought she was understanding the lessons.  About a week ago, she told me her school also started Physics tuition. I said it was okay and told her that I am still available if she needs help. Two days ago, I asked her mother about it again.  Then today, her mother called me and said her daughter “doesn’t understand anything I teach” and they want to stop the tuition.  I didn’t argue. I just said okay. But after that, I started thinking about everything.  The strange thing is that during class, she actually understood what I taught. She answered my questions, remembered formulas, and solved problems with me. The only problem was she almost never did the homework. Every time I asked, she said she didn’t do it or was too busy to do it. So I told her I would take a small test soon.  Now I feel like maybe she got scared or stressed because she wasn’t practicing at home. Maybe she felt pressure when I said I would take a test. Or maybe she simply wasn’t interested in studying physics with me. School tuition might have felt easier for her.  I also think the mother used the excuse “she doesn’t understand anything” because it’s easier than saying “my daughter didn’t do homework” or “she didn’t want tuition.”  Maybe my teaching style and her learning style didn’t match. Maybe she wasn’t ready for the routine and homework. I don’t know.  I just want to know if other tutors in Nepal have faced this.   Does this happen often?   Students understand during class but leave when it gets serious?   How do you deal with this kind of situation?  I’m not angry. Just a bit confused and disappointed. Any advice or similar experiences would help.",

            "body": "I had a dog ( japanese spitz ) , 2 and half years old in my home. I had bought him when he was just 40 days old so you can understand how much i loved him. He was like a family to me. My family loved that dog to the heart. Yes, he was bit naughty but he hadn't once disobeyed me and my family members once.  Yesterday, an incident happened. He had a habit of going to the road ( not a busy one as i am living in remote area and only few tracters and bike move) for either roaming, playing and sometimes for toilet purposes. In the morning, a person from my village had threatened to kill him just for barking at him ( he was driving tge tracter) but i didn't cared that much. But during the afternoon, when my whole family was busy in home chores, the dog happened to go the road and that person willingly struck him with his vehicle ( tracter). My neighbours saw it and even before realizing, he fleed from there and my dog was lying there unconscious and just under 2-3 minutes he died. Upon checking, there was no major bruishes on this body but may be internal bleeding had started because of the shock in the head or whatever the reason ( he died within 2-3 minutes).  From that day, i haven't been able to reconcile the event. My parents are deeply saddened and sometimes even cry and i think my dog needs justice. There wasn't a single incident in the past that he bite someone or even barked someone without any cause and now he is no more. I even tried to confront him that day, asking him wht he did what he did , called him on his home, but nobody came outside and now he has completely avoided walking from the road of my home. I had tried to talk with him several times, even asked my ward chairperson to see the situation but noone is helping?   Isn't there any law or anything that i can do to make him pay for what he did? Or atleast make him apologize for his actions so that such actions won't recuur in the future? I need sugesstions as this is very depressing and i am saddened by the looks of my parents eyes everyday.",

But you're equally at fault for letting the dog off alone on street.  >There wasn't a single incident in the past that he bite someone or even barked someone without any cause   Be it human or animal, their behaviour toward someone they're familiar and stranger is different.   Also, kept dogs are pain in ass for drivers as they're used to going near human, sometimes they even approach running vehicles which it risky for both driver and dog. Yestai kei bhayo hola ra tw timilai warn gareko thiyo, aafno irresponsibility ko blame aru lai nadeko bes.   But still killing seems too much, right? That dog was your friend so you viewed it differently. For many, dog or goat are same, we don't treat them differently; we kill them if necessary. Animal rights are there to prevent extreme animal abuse and keep them from going extinct, asking them for same rights as human is just being selfish, makes no sense.|||> He had a habit of going to the road   And you as a owner of your pet are expected to take care of it.

In my neighborhood, a dog belonging to a neighbor snatched the face of a woman, like literally. It was fucking horrible. Then everyone was warned to put their dogs in leash and inside their homes.

And being north of these countries, well , you get plenty of emissions carried by the wind which dissipates in our mountain ranges.

People call me \"chicken curry\" \"mango lussy\", make jokes about scam call centres, even though I specifically tell them I'm not Indian. Simply looking Indian enough is already a basis for xenophobic comments.   Now for everyone saying that I'm letting simple words affect me: if it were simply words and had no broad implications on my life, I wouldn't care but it does. My mom has to fight her way just to get a job that accepts her qualifications (those qualifications are from a GERMAN university and she has more work experience than all her peers) and the way she is treated as simple cheap labour being forced to do jobs that are under her qualifications is insane. She has been working in the hospital here for over 12 years btw.   So there are visible material effects and it's getting worse by the day. The German state has been talking about banning refugees from public gatherings, how long until it's not only refugees from Syria but also US? People get pushed, punched, harrassed for things they have no control over... There is no future for us here and we don't belong here.   I'm very thankful for having seen this country but I don't see myself living here any longer any more. Around 53% of Germans have recently mentioned they'd vote for parties that advertise specifically xenophobic policies, specifically AFD and the CDU. The amount of hatred is only increasing and it's been worsened through anti Indian social media trends.   Anyone thinking about working abroad: you'll face many issues on the way. Even if you do everything perfect, even if your German is excellent, even if you are charismatic. Sometimes all that combined isn't enough.

But I will never forget the racist comment someone told me because of my boyfriend and it was the most hurtful thing I ever heard and it wasn’t even about me directly. So I can only imagine what you must feel like and I truly hope things change here again soon :((|||Anti immigration sentiments r high here in US and also in Australia I heard. I have been in US 21 years.. never seen anything like this |||Just last week me and my group Nepali friends encountered blatant racism where someone said that there are “too many of us”. It was my first time experiencing such blatant racism.   I’ve been in Aus for almost a decade now, and imo the sentiment towards immigrants has been the worst in all of my time being here. There were always few instances of subtle racism where someone would be a little too patronising or passive aggressive for example asking where I’m REALLY from, how my English is so good or assuming I don’t speak good English, and so on. But never such blatant racism….not the best of feelings tbh.  The problem is Asian hate (inc Indians) is taken very lightly in Australia and most Western nations. Asians and Indians are very easy targets. What doesn’t help is other fellow South-Asians (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and also Nepalis) participate heavily in hating Indians not knowing that to a racist we are all the same. I’m hoping tensions don’t flare up and turn physically violent. Rough times ahead for immigrants in Australia imo|||This one of the reasons I don't wanna go out anymore, you will always be outsider in foreign country no matter how much you try even if you were born there- if you look diff, that's it. It will never feel like home simply cause everyone around won't, that feeling of walking nonchalantly in your own streets, blending in and not feeling watched- the things we take for granted ain't gonna be there ever.|||I know it sucks and you can't do anything. You can't get general people to get the xenophobic feelings out of their head. You know very week the reasons that have pushed them to feel that way - denying and blaming is not the solution.   Also, for some (like in your case looking of Indian origin) genetics can fk us , not to do anything with your aesthetics, especially in situations like this. I have a few friends who work in Austria and are of Mongolian origin and get work in mountain areas because he told them that he is Sherpa. In those countries apparently mongol people are less discriminated compared to you and I, of Aryan origin who looks Afghani.|||indians last 10-15 yrs  afno lack of civic sense, thagi,impolite behavior, lack of personal hygiene le yeti gand failayo , tesai ko result ho  asti Aus ko reel herya khate haru swimming pool ma sabun lagaera nuhaudai k !!|||What city are you living in? Maybe it's time to move to a different place in Germany.   I know certain areas are very hostile towards immigrants. But it's not the case everywhere.   I've been in Germany for 8 years now, and have been working in completely German spaces for 4 of those years. I'm the only non-german at my current workplace with mostly older colleagues and I've never heard such comments.   Everyday racism in the form of ignorant comments is common, unfortunately. But no one has ever called me mango lassi, or any other weird names due to me being a brown person.   It's already difficult to live in a foreign land, you don't have to add to the burden by living in an extreme right area.|||Nowhere is better than your own country. |||the way out of it is, the population of South Asian in the west has to continue growing and the representation has to take more space in areas of society.|||[removed]|||Everything is tied to economy, Germany (west in general) is getting poorer, getting poorer makes people mad, politicians directs anger towards migrants. It's not going to get easier.   Also Germany a few generations ago is an example of how bad it can get.|||Hate, racism, castiesm and descrimination is always bad experience.   So has been in our country. Letz forget about abroad, and speak up aginst such discriminations in our own country.|||Sorry you feel that way.   A country cannot forever take the refugees. There’s a limit on how open you want to help other. Immigrants are possible since they add value and boost economy. Refugees needs to be taken care of. When your own citizen are not in good place, such friction is bound to happen. So country should be able to refuse refugees if they cannot handle it or afford it any more .    Also, i cannot personally tell who that white guy is from or the black guy or the Latino or Asian. So, I am not surprised if they see you as part of larger dominating group. Like , Canadian being confused for American. 🤷🏻‍♂️or every Latinos being confused for Mexicans . If good Asian call them Korea or Japanese and for bad one call them Chinese. This kind of racism has existed . Subtle or explicit.   And it’s their country, they make the rules. It’s the democracy in practice. Respecting the rules that was mandated by the people or the elected bodies.   And I am a bit surprised you were expecting immigrant to get treated as equal as citizens? Thats a very hopeful move. Maybe first generation might get such opportunities but the immigrants who moved there it’s not even possible. Your experience starts the moment you land there . Not what you did in the third world country.   Later you might be able to provided not just skills but your language is good too. And your culture fit . Immigrant need to adjust to host country. You should not be expecting them to accommodate your every cultural nuances.   Western country treat more humanely than Kafala system like those of Middle East , even Korea and Japan are no good. Western country at least respect the basic human rights.    And if you have been living there so long, was eligible to take citizenship but did not . It mean that relationship with the host country you had is pure transactional. Not something like “Canadians are born all over the world, it just sometimes takes them a bit of time to get here.” Just replace the Canada with any host country. So, if you don’t take citizenship after being hosted and being eligible and had time, this was pure transactional not a connection you should have felt with host country. So they will be hostile . Which is wrong but it’s their country we Are guest there.    I have been mistaken for being Pakistani or Afghan or Middle East and mostly Latino . Some don’t even speak English straight up speak Spanish. Even if i Say Nepal, some say Naples . So they imagine the minority they interact or come in contact with .    I have not personally faced the racism. The hate are on rise especially after Russia Ukraine war and Indian Government making deal with Russia to purchase their oil on discount under green light of West. Kuro k Ho bhane, you are guest there, always remember that. Don’t ever forget, western country have one of the most atrocities in the recorded history.   Just be safe and cautious.   While you complain here, have you ever thought of working class of Nepal? Those people with same qualifications but with wrong family name? Or born in wrong geography? Ever think of working conditions of laborer of Nepal? Talked with them? What you have done? It is easy to take the hit when you are victim in another system but remember there are Nepali here who also suffer same systemic injustice.

Unfortunately we are at the end of the liberal democracy. Oh well. It was good while it lasted .|||Yeah true.   I hate to use racial profiling on people since it is not common in Nepal.   I live in Australia, I don’t call my anglo Australian friends “white” or my African Aussies “black”. People using skin color to identify has always been a cultural shock for me.  However, not to be racist, but expecting anyone other than Nepali people to acknowledge you being a Nepali is a waste of your time. Don’t waste your energy telling them you are from Nepal. They will NEVER understand   In their eyes: everything is about RACE. There are people who don’t care about race but to be on the safe side, it’s fair to assume most of them use racial identity as the main identification.   You may ask : “isn’t expecting white people to be racist, just because they are white, racist in itself?” , yeah it is. But like they say - while in Rome, do what Romans do.   ——  P.S racism doesn’t always mean Hate. Stereotyping anything based on race is racism. Like “Chinese being good at maths”. These sets unrealistic expectations and harms the people.   Regardless of whether they are being mean or not, Their whole belief system is based on RACE.|||Not relevant to r/Nepal.

After a week—I think it might’ve been more than a week—a team of people finally came to my house. Unfortunately, I wasn't home, but my parents were. The officials included Child and Women Protection officers, and I think some police officers as well.  They asked to see the site where these Nepali citizens were living. My dad took them there, and they found people living in big tents (the same kind we usually see being used by people from Bangladesh who come illegally into India). There were a lot of girls—mostly young girls—living there, and there were **no toilets** for them. At night, we could hear noises from that area like screaming, crying, and fighting.  The team did arrive, but honestly, it was too late. The workers had already shifted to another location for their work. When I talked to the officers on the phone, instead of giving me a solution or next steps, **they started asking me what I thought they should do.**  I was honestly surprised because aren't they the officials? Aren't they supposed to know what to do and handle these situations? Instead, they asked me things like:  >  I argued with them a lot, but sadly, not much happened.  The only action taken was that the workers were provided portable toilets (like the ones used on film sets), and the contractor was fined for violating labor laws.   (At least, that’s what they told me.)  What shocked me even more was the reaction from people in our neighborhood—including my own mother. They were praising those young girls for how much hard work they were doing at such a young age. They were carrying heavy cement bags.  Nobody seemed concerned about the fact that this was **child labour.**  And this is just one tiny incident. Every single day across India, countless children are being exploited by contractors, corporations, and even their own families—sometimes because poverty leaves them with no other option.  And I don’t blame those families entirely, because many of them genuinely have no choice.  But in this specific case with the Nepali workers, something felt even more complicated. We later found out that these families actually had houses in Nepal. They had **two sons studying in a boarding school**, and the parents sent money back for their education.  Meanwhile, the daughters were doing labour work here. When asked why, the men replied:  >",

If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.

Got a good tech job & didn’t study bachelors after +2. Will stay here if I keep earning what I am right now else I’ll move.|||Stayed after +2, and completed my bachelor's a year ago. Had started working professionally 2 years ago with a beginning salary of 12k per month. Kept on switching jobs until I reached 40k. Tara i realized ki I can earn more for the amount of work i do abroad so I'm planning to purse my masters in Australia.   I would say youth should stay until they complete their bachelor's in the country. Tespaxi they will know if either staying or going abroad is the best choice. By staying in Nepal i found my perfect career that aligns with my interest because i had time to try it out. Abroad gako vaye chai maybe i wouldn't still have figured it out till now|||bahira janu bhanda paile consider what you want in life and what safety-net do you have when things go wrong. I see so many people go abroad and then become aimless or lose focus due to stress or lack of dicipline.   If you want to succeed abroad, make sure to have people who can guide you or give advise, friends whom you can study/live with, ani family who will motivate you when your are on your own. Dont just jump to decision because there is no hope here.|||I consider myself a good academic guy been into tech since grade 6, done everything ani aaile i regret staying here, looking for ways to get out of this place, bachelors sakna lagya I'm literally counting days.

Traveled to two countries for free via a BIG COMPANY, Won so many tech competitions and made a good name in the tech community. I joined a fortune 500 company's student program and did so much for others in the community and not to mention that I made some good money too from tech clients. Yes, debts haru thiyo family ko which I am trying to pay off slowly. Degree ko naam ma euta IT degree garera bhyauna lachu kei mahina ma. That helped a bit too. Kunai pani field hos, afno side bata effort lagayera dherai kaam garena bhane jun field ma jada ni baba ji ka thuloo nai huncha.  Now traveling to the USA for yet another conference soon and starting my own business too. Maybe exposure or experience ko lagi masters garchu hola bahira but settle hunna sakdo. If business works, for sure janna bahira, if not, will use that as my last option.  I am not trying to flex or brag here. Yaha basera ni kei garna sakincha bhanna sakdai chu.

PS: I was feeling so down right now and opened reddit and saw this. Reply garda gardai I remembered my achievements and got motivated. Thank you.|||Depends upon your circumstances|||Worth it, i know it wont make sense now but it depends on how you spent your time|||I stayed and completed my engineering here in Nepal (graduated in 2018). First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here. One of my friends is supposedly earning 3lakhs+ monthly salary in Nepal.       TL:DR; I'd suggest at least study bachelors here and gain few years of professional experience before going abroad. You'll 100% not regret it.|||I will probably stay in nepal for a long time i am studying ca so i see opportunities definitely. I will probably also do acca,cpa and cfa so after maybe 7,8 years i can go abroad if i couldn't do anything |||My story: Stayed in nepal.. got into a foreign uni affiliated college, and doing remote job at a foreign country.    My suggestion: If you are willing to pull this off, then stay.. else leave🙂. I am just lucky enough to be in the top 5% or even 1% ig. But looking at the situation of my friends and even myself when i was jobless for a while earlier, i wouldn't recommend staying here after +2.   Answering your other questions.. (In my POV)   Fees: private colleges ko 10 - 20 lakhs xa fees mostly. Aba scholarships paye sasto hola ig.   Quality: ja padhe ni mostly basics nai ho. Job lai chahine skills, experience / internships, self learning le matra badhxa.   Job opportunities: xa tara thorai xa and competition dherai with respect to opportunities.   Salary: depends. Ramro company mah ramrai xa. aru mah normally bare minimum bata nai suru bhairaxa. Private mah time mah nauune, increment nahune chai dherai suninxa and bhogya ni xu. Yo answer garho xa. All depends on your skills, YOE, job, company etc. Dherai factors hunxa.   Part time jobs: koi chinya manxey bata pasal, dept stores, basic accounting, part time paid intern or delivery, pathao, Indrive matra dimag mah auuxa.

What I need help with:  Which brand/models have the best cooling & lowest fan noise under sustained load? I’m sensitive to loud fans.  Battery life tradeoffs — I want decent battery for classes but will also do gaming.  Where to buy in Kathmandu / reliable Nepal retailers  and tips for negotiating/warranty..   My priorities (ranked):   1) Good cooling & low fan noise.   2). Value for money (long-term reliability > flashy RGB).   3) Reasonable battery life    Please suggest specific models (and if possible, local prices or links). Real user experiences and comparisons would help the most.  Thanks in advance — any help is appreciated! 🙏",

Do you know TCPShield? You could build something similar but start small  maybe with just 25% of their features. After that, try partnering with ISPs so you can build stronger, more reliable connections. Then aim for government contracts. Honestly around 95% of Nepali government websites dont have proper DDoS protection or any real security layers so there’s a huge gap you could fill.|||Why/how do you think you are gonna get 20-30 employees from the start?

            "body": "Long story short she had a boyfriend. She asked me to meet him which I did and said \"Don't  do anything that'll cost you , he's not good for you.\" Human nature you see, she did exactly what I told her not to do. When we weren't home she dared to bring him home and did the deed. Also sold my gold earrings which my dead Grandma gave me as a momento, to fund his lifestyle. That kid was tipical tyape, all about hooka, cafe hooping ganja, alcohol, god what not .Apparently  he did blackmail her into having  sex.I do feel guilty that I didn't fucking slap her some senses and asked her to break up when she said she had a boyfriend. 16 is fucking young.  And after that incident she was closed off, rarely came out of her room. Predictable but hey I was blinded by rage so  I didn't  bother with her. I'm too old to act like that but what's done is done.My mom and dad aren't the best when it comes to communication so they just scolded her even slapped her , maybe call her names like yk the B and R word always after that.Now after 5 month some dude who's a minor too just came to our house 2 days ago at night claiming he loves her, wants her, drunk af with 4-5 bikers. Made a huge scene, we called the police made police report, she lied abt not knowing the guy but she admitted talking to him on insta 2 months back,😮‍💨 she became a pathological liar.   So today I came home as usual and mom told me she's missing we called the cops , her class teacher and we got to know that after class she went with some guy. Her class mates said she claimed to be going on a trip to pokara for 10 days with her boyfriend.MY DAD is crying hard so is my mom , I pity them. We aren't well off so we took loan to sent her off to clz , bought her phone with loan money. I don't remember being this ungrateful as a teen. But I'm not her. Haven't tried putting myself in her shoes.I never tried to understand her as I don't like her. Maybe because we didn't give her the attention she needed.The love that she craved for her to turn to bad influence.  Anyway kids just speak out your feelings to your family maybe or seek therapy or get a life please rather than doing stuff that'll ruin you and worry your family.",

I hope she will come back to home safely. Also, take care of yourself man.|||We all have that one stage where parents pressure gets too much and we turn to random people online to chat with but actually meeting them and  going out with them is on another level. And the guy clearly took advantage of her mental state.|||This is clearly due to bad parenting and her toxic friend circle. Parents need to know what kind of friends does their children have and not let them get into bad influence. Her mind is already brainwashed into thinking she knows what's right for her and she's not listening to any of the family members. Maybe try to convince her using someone she respects or whose opinion she might take in when you find her.|||Thats so sad bro. I hope she comes back soon safely.|||Take care op.|||Take care yar|||Maybe if you had tried to make her comfortable, the result would have been different. Slapping and scolding is fine. But after few monent, if only you and your family had been there for her. Instead of making her feel disgrace calling her b or r, just maybe you guys were there for her.  I am not defending her act, at the age of 16, she cant separate right or wrong. Her mistake. But dont overwhelm someone who is already filled with guilt and embarrassment.|||Take care yaar, being the elder brother/sister she'll be more willing to talk to you than to your parents.  Message her on socials, ask her friends try every possible way in the playbook. make it sound like it's not a big deal if she ever responds, tell her to come back, coax her and most of all shield her from your parents. IK parents will go absolutely batshit crazy (happened with my cousin too) it's your job to shield her. tra tell them not to scold or put what happened it in negative way kina bhane aajhai risairaakhnu bhaako xa type ko kura bhaneu bhane aauna nih darauxa  Make her feel safe and sound and also make her realize her mistake   Once again take care and may you find your sister bro/sis|||Block the river, and it will flood out..   Direct the river at its course and it will follow your lead...  It ain't too late for your sister to get back to her senses but once a child sees themselves as an adult, there is no going back... So treat her as an adult now..     She's bound to repeat that classic nepali cheli mistake unless enlightened..  so ask yourself, when she comes back after committing all sorts of mistakes, will you be standing beside her as her brother or as a son that demands her to be punished for her deeds..  May the force be with you..|||Are you her sister or brother? 16 is a rebellious age  but I won’t say young to date. It is okay for puppy love but having sex a big no|||Vete pachi ramro sanga Kura garana na vaya traumatized huxan yesto Kura le take care of you and your family op|||I have a slightly different take on this.   This happens because of bad parenting. Parents not being there for their children and not providing emotional care and support. So the child starts looking it elsewhere.  Specially during adolescence, parents need to be even more attentive and understanding towards their children.   Normally we always blame the girls, but we are all human beings with desires.  You can’t expect a 16 year old to go to therapy and work on themselves. They are still children and a minor.   The parents are the ones legally and morally responsible to ensure that their child gets appropriate emotional care and support, feel loved so that they can reach out when they need support.   Mostly people try to hide these things and act like it didn’t happen rather than take corrective measures.   Paying for college or buying phone is not emotional care and support.   I also feel bad for you because it seems like you’re the one taking all of that responsibility in your shoulders, including your parents mood swings and emotional outbursts.   Legally or morally, you can’t blame a 16 year old leaving house with some friend or boyfriend. Clearly something was missing in her upbringing. She is still a minor and needs protection, not slapping and B/R calling.  Why would a 16 year old child leave their home and go out with a friend for 10 days if she really felt loved and cared in her home ? Think about this !!  I’m sure she’ll be back. If you’re an adult please try and have a difficult conversation with your parents regarding this. But I know most Nepali parents compare love with money and for them loaning out tuition fee is a kind of emotional blackmail they use to guilt and shame their children. So it might not work at all.   Why not Just send them to government schools if you can’t afford it, but give them real love because it’s what they remember when they grow up.|||if you dont have problems showing her photo on public then you should post her photo and missing story on internet , it will make it easy to find her   ani after you find her, as her sister try and be emotional , empathetic ani act like you understand her and you are with her  this will make it so that , any future esto plannings haru she may discuss with you since she trusts you ani you will also get more info about her in general which might lead to you finding the real problem|||crazy how the people are getting sexual so normally, nowadays. I mean sex is nt big deal, but such a young age, it never can be so healthy. How can person know what is good for them at that age? only filled with trauma and regrets later. I didnt even kissed a girl, until i was like 18. people random shit nowadays to be cool i guess.|||I don't think she has courage to come back . You would have to report this incident to police.

But when she comes back let her know about the consequences of her action calmly. Don't make her feel like a disgrace as this would make her go rebellion even more.|||God this sounds epic n not nice if its real|||contact police, 16 is minor, I believe.  , also if you know that guy, try to find that guy's address, take people/ relatives with you. talk with parents.      16 is too young|||It's sad. In your sister's head she is right. She is still a minor. She doesn't know what's right and what's wrong. I don't know why these days kids are into relationship 🤦 I think in her head, she found her soulmate but this is soo much wrong. I hope she is safe and could figure out what she is doing is wrong.|||should know what your kids are upto. feel sorry for your father get her out of this she will really regret her choices later on. dont be harsh try even she is rude try to be soft and calm. she will ruin her life be there for her in this situation, she feels neglected and does things to get reaction out of u. just get get her out of this anyhow. praying for her and your family|||This is really messed up… She’s probably already dealing with fear of embarrassment and shame, and shame is one of the hardest emotions for adolescents to process they often lack the coping mechanisms to handle it well. These behaviors don’t happen in isolation or overnight; she may have developed a strong need for male validation and become quite deeply wired into these patterns.  You seem thoughtful for recognizing you haven’t tried to see things from her perspective, and she does appear to have been misled by negative influences. It’s interesting how siblings from the same family raised in similar environments can turn out so differently… Parenting is complicated that way. Anyway What matters now is hoping she returns safely and finding ways for your family to cope. The social pressure and judgment from others adds another layer of stress for everyone involved.|||Tyo ghar ma aako Kta ko k vayo ?|||How old is that guy? 16 is a minor age, and parents have full rights to control her( but dont let your parents abuse her)|||A honest suggestion to OP. Lock her in home for 7 days keep your family together and do the formal way try to tell her in a good way like every single day until day 5. Its her life but depends upon you. After day 5 if you think It worked then do some checkings everyday. Tell her to focus on her study. If not a one slap in day 6 and 3 hr of lecture. Same thing I suggested my friend older than me but still a friend tho he was just 21 case was similar. It worked to some extent. Make her live in fear for few days. FEw months later she may understand. Keep us updated. Felt so bad for you.",

Wahale chahi sabai aafai bujhi elaborate garera aafnai examples lekhna sikaunu vayo. Infact topics ko advantages haru wa properties haru lekhda ni one word haina one sentence lekhna lagaunu hunthiyo. So for 11th see as per your teacher preferences. Board ma do what you prefer because at the end of the day you’re the one writing the answers so write in the way you’re most comfortable at. I personally like the 2nd one where i elaborate myself. Btw board ma ta mero ni eco ma A+ ta aayena🤣😭",

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend?

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||When you leave Nepal and meet fellow Nepalese, you will continue this tradition.|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away.

Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||Just coming home from the match, surreal experience.

People call me \"chicken curry\" \"mango lussy\", make jokes about scam call centres, even though I specifically tell them I'm not Indian. Simply looking Indian enough is already a basis for xenophobic comments.   Now for everyone saying that I'm letting simple words affect me: if it were simply words and had no broad implications on my life, I wouldn't care but it does. My mom has to fight her way just to get a job that accepts her qualifications (those qualifications are from a GERMAN university and she has more work experience than all her peers) and the way she is treated as simple cheap labour being forced to do jobs that are under her qualifications is insane. She has been working in the hospital here for over 12 years btw.   So there are visible material effects and it's getting worse by the day. The German state has been talking about banning refugees from public gatherings, how long until it's not only refugees from Syria but also US? People get pushed, punched, harrassed for things they have no control over... There is no future for us here and we don't belong here.   I'm very thankful for having seen this country but I don't see myself living here any longer any more. Around 53% of Germans have recently mentioned they'd vote for parties that advertise specifically xenophobic policies, specifically AFD and the CDU. The amount of hatred is only increasing and it's been worsened through anti Indian social media trends.   Anyone thinking about working abroad: you'll face many issues on the way. Even if you do everything perfect, even if your German is excellent, even if you are charismatic. Sometimes all that combined isn't enough.   I don't wanna ramble too much but it's fucking tiring paying taxes doing 8 hours of labour everyday just to feel like these public places don't belong to. It's mentally exhausting and I seriously don't know what the future is at this point.",

I think he doesn’t experience too much racism because he lives in a really left leaning bubble with me, my family and our friends and also at his work (he works at the university) so it’s even more shocking to hear your experience. But I will never forget the racist comment someone told me because of my boyfriend and it was the most hurtful thing I ever heard and it wasn’t even about me directly. So I can only imagine what you must feel like and I truly hope things change here again soon :((|||Anti immigration sentiments r high here in US and also in Australia I heard. I have been in US 21 years.. never seen anything like this |||Just last week me and my group Nepali friends encountered blatant racism where someone said that there are “too many of us”. It was my first time experiencing such blatant racism.   I’ve been in Aus for almost a decade now, and imo the sentiment towards immigrants has been the worst in all of my time being here. There were always few instances of subtle racism where someone would be a little too patronising or passive aggressive for example asking where I’m REALLY from, how my English is so good or assuming I don’t speak good English, and so on. But never such blatant racism….not the best of feelings tbh.  The problem is Asian hate (inc Indians) is taken very lightly in Australia and most Western nations. Asians and Indians are very easy targets. What doesn’t help is other fellow South-Asians (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and also Nepalis) participate heavily in hating Indians not knowing that to a racist we are all the same. I’m hoping tensions don’t flare up and turn physically violent. Rough times ahead for immigrants in Australia imo|||This one of the reasons I don't wanna go out anymore, you will always be outsider in foreign country no matter how much you try even if you were born there- if you look diff, that's it. It will never feel like home simply cause everyone around won't, that feeling of walking nonchalantly in your own streets, blending in and not feeling watched- the things we take for granted ain't gonna be there ever.|||I know it sucks and you can't do anything. You can't get general people to get the xenophobic feelings out of their head. You know very week the reasons that have pushed them to feel that way - denying and blaming is not the solution.   Also, for some (like in your case looking of Indian origin) genetics can fk us , not to do anything with your aesthetics, especially in situations like this. I have a few friends who work in Austria and are of Mongolian origin and get work in mountain areas because he told them that he is Sherpa. In those countries apparently mongol people are less discriminated compared to you and I, of Aryan origin who looks Afghani.|||indians last 10-15 yrs  afno lack of civic sense, thagi,impolite behavior, lack of personal hygiene le yeti gand failayo , tesai ko result ho  asti Aus ko reel herya khate haru swimming pool ma sabun lagaera nuhaudai k !!|||What city are you living in? Maybe it's time to move to a different place in Germany.   I know certain areas are very hostile towards immigrants. But it's not the case everywhere.   I've been in Germany for 8 years now, and have been working in completely German spaces for 4 of those years. I'm the only non-german at my current workplace with mostly older colleagues and I've never heard such comments.   Everyday racism in the form of ignorant comments is common, unfortunately. But no one has ever called me mango lassi, or any other weird names due to me being a brown person.   It's already difficult to live in a foreign land, you don't have to add to the burden by living in an extreme right area.|||Nowhere is better than your own country. |||the way out of it is, the population of South Asian in the west has to continue growing and the representation has to take more space in areas of society.|||[removed]|||Everything is tied to economy, Germany (west in general) is getting poorer, getting poorer makes people mad, politicians directs anger towards migrants. It's not going to get easier.   Also Germany a few generations ago is an example of how bad it can get.|||Hate, racism, castiesm and descrimination is always bad experience.   So has been in our country. Letz forget about abroad, and speak up aginst such discriminations in our own country.|||Sorry you feel that way.   A country cannot forever take the refugees. There’s a limit on how open you want to help other. Immigrants are possible since they add value and boost economy. Refugees needs to be taken care of. When your own citizen are not in good place, such friction is bound to happen. So country should be able to refuse refugees if they cannot handle it or afford it any more .    Also, i cannot personally tell who that white guy is from or the black guy or the Latino or Asian. So, I am not surprised if they see you as part of larger dominating group. Like , Canadian being confused for American. 🤷🏻‍♂️or every Latinos being confused for Mexicans . If good Asian call them Korea or Japanese and for bad one call them Chinese. This kind of racism has existed . Subtle or explicit.   And it’s their country, they make the rules. It’s the democracy in practice. Respecting the rules that was mandated by the people or the elected bodies.   And I am a bit surprised you were expecting immigrant to get treated as equal as citizens? Thats a very hopeful move. Maybe first generation might get such opportunities but the immigrants who moved there it’s not even possible. Your experience starts the moment you land there . Not what you did in the third world country.   Later you might be able to provided not just skills but your language is good too. And your culture fit . Immigrant need to adjust to host country. You should not be expecting them to accommodate your every cultural nuances.   Western country treat more humanely than Kafala system like those of Middle East , even Korea and Japan are no good. Western country at least respect the basic human rights.    And if you have been living there so long, was eligible to take citizenship but did not . It mean that relationship with the host country you had is pure transactional. Not something like “Canadians are born all over the world, it just sometimes takes them a bit of time to get here.” Just replace the Canada with any host country. So, if you don’t take citizenship after being hosted and being eligible and had time, this was pure transactional not a connection you should have felt with host country. So they will be hostile . Which is wrong but it’s their country we Are guest there.    I have been mistaken for being Pakistani or Afghan or Middle East and mostly Latino . Some don’t even speak English straight up speak Spanish. Even if i Say Nepal, some say Naples . So they imagine the minority they interact or come in contact with .    I have not personally faced the racism. The hate are on rise especially after Russia Ukraine war and Indian Government making deal with Russia to purchase their oil on discount under green light of West. Kuro k Ho bhane, you are guest there, always remember that. Don’t ever forget, western country have one of the most atrocities in the recorded history.   Just be safe and cautious.   While you complain here, have you ever thought of working class of Nepal? Those people with same qualifications but with wrong family name? Or born in wrong geography? Ever think of working conditions of laborer of Nepal? Talked with them? What you have done? It is easy to take the hit when you are victim in another system but remember there are Nepali here who also suffer same systemic injustice. Like how certain group of people’s nationality is always questioned especially one doing the menial job.   This is just a life cycle or political cycle. Unfortunately we are at the end of the liberal democracy. Oh well. It was good while it lasted .|||Yeah true.   I hate to use racial profiling on people since it is not common in Nepal.   I live in Australia, I don’t call my anglo Australian friends “white” or my African Aussies “black”. People using skin color to identify has always been a cultural shock for me.  However, not to be racist, but expecting anyone other than Nepali people to acknowledge you being a Nepali is a waste of your time. Don’t waste your energy telling them you are from Nepal. They will NEVER understand   In their eyes: everything is about RACE. There are people who don’t care about race but to be on the safe side, it’s fair to assume most of them use racial identity as the main identification.   You may ask : “isn’t expecting white people to be racist, just because they are white, racist in itself?” , yeah it is. But like they say - while in Rome, do what Romans do.   ——  P.S racism doesn’t always mean Hate. Stereotyping anything based on race is racism. Like “Chinese being good at maths”. These sets unrealistic expectations and harms the people.   Regardless of whether they are being mean or not, Their whole belief system is based on RACE.|||Not relevant to r/Nepal.

            "body": "So yesterday CEE results came, congrats to whoever succeeded. I'm a med student myself and have seen a lot and lot of students who regret joining medicine. There are passionate guys, i know. The road looks greener on the other side, be it during CEE or during MBBS. The only thing that keeps most med students going in Nepal is the fact that you can earn a shitton load of money abroad. But that too, requires a lot of investment and efforts. I've seen a lot of students studying in paying who are doing academically good, but regret joining MBBS. I've seen scholars failing every internal exams too. I'm active on the indianmedschool subreddit and that's a different depressing tale of there.   If you want to study in paying and your yearly household savings is not more than 8L, DON'T. If you want to study in scholarship and you got your name enlisted, go for it. But it you want to drop a year just to be in this rat-race again, I would not suggest you to. Find passion in something, but medicine is not the place if you can't see yourself being anything other than a doctor. It is said easier than done, but medicine is definitely hard. That's why medics are respected everywhere (except india and nepal ofcourse).  Anyways, I wanted to share that doctors study 5.5 years, like no other course within medicine. There used to be a time when intern doctors were looked up to. But now, due to the fact that everyone has spread the wisdom that intern doctors have no hands-on experience, everyone looks down upon them. Even the nurses and pharmacists. Not trying to demean any course, but the volume others read in 2 years is presented to MBBS students to memorise within 1 year (judging by the volume).   Being from a well-to do family, I was always presented to anyone new as a \"future doc\". So, it never came to my mind that I could do anything other than medicine. Medicine itself is not bad. But the fact that there is no value in Nepal even after completing your MBBS has started to hit me too. There are 2 category of people I see around me. One who enjoy life, dont study much, search for shortcuts to pass the exams as if they joined medicine just to pass exams. Others who study well, are depressed, have not much social life and regret joining this course. Had I gone abroad, I wouldn't have had to anticipate my parents' money each month just for survival, I would've been able to send some cash home and uplift our overall standard. That thing haunts me, and I think it will be so till I get into MD or residency. But the fact that you can earn six figures is what is keeping me sane. I deeply love medicine, the fact that whatever I'm studying is somebody's life, each case I observe today, I might get to encounter it someday is what keeps me motivated. But I don't thing I can last long just like how my friends threw away standard textbooks to rot memorize fasttrack. I'm scared I might do it too, the question is: How long can I last?",

If you are creative, are rich plus you are really smart, Dont join medicine.  It is not the best strategy for the earn big life. Its for a stable, middle class to upper middle class life.  I see people joining medicine for that reason. No. If you are the right person, a businessman , IT person >>> Doctor. Thats why I am studying both as well in the side despite being a Doctor.   ----- But being a Doctor has this high ceiling. If You become an HA, or a nurse or a pharmacist. No high celing. When you take the MBBS route, the sky is the limit. There are many oppurtunities, many line of work you can get into, easy to travel and relocate etc.   --- Is the whole field of MBBS in Nepal doomed? No.  Its a battle.  Some people , ho they are victims. Medicine victimizes many. Residency can be toxic. Many do suicide attempts and so on. Auta battle ma k huncha? Does everyone die? Afai bujnus.  There is the other side as well. Not many get to experience it. But its also a case of luck, how well connected you are, how smart you are, not just book smart. Also getting a job is not that hard compared to others. From the start, you have this sense of being respected, earning decent (its just the start). The idea is you earn big as your experience and avlue increases.  When people dream of MBBS , this part is what they are dreaming of. But what they dont realize is its a battle. Afu victimize vayera a life long addictions dekhi self harm  dekhi liyera testo ma pani gaincha. Many do. Reality. But many also come alive, fit and fine.   But objective measures ma herni vaye, if you want a an upper middle class life style, stable, always needed, sense of meaning and purpose,  not just money, a chance to be a leader for patients, juniors, nurses, Doctor is okay. You are kinda the apex of healthcare.   But if you want to earn big -- Business, IT, Finance. But only if you are very very smart.  Dont know about other professions, but I know each has their own good and bad sides. You choose based on your own goals and needs.|||As another medstudent my suggestion is just don't listen to medinfluencers for your career. And don't get into it for money. Yes you will earn decent money but almost 6 to 7 years after you start you will see your friends who took a different route earn, enjoy their youth while you're still just maybe a little bit more then halfway across your journey .You will rot away in a room with Davidson and Bailey and it will be stressful. So take it only if you can see yourself through gritty stress during exams and almost spending 2 to 3 hrs everyday dedicated to your studies. It's not all sad though its chaotic fun as fuck too so weigh your pros and cons don't listen to others advice just think if you are ready to give up 6 to 7 years purely to studies. Now most med aspirants think that they will go abroad after their finals but let me give you a fair bit of warning and that is its the hardest course you can choose to go abroad you will not only be competing with Nepalese for USMLE or AMC or PLAB it will be best of the best across the globe . And on top of that just your intellect won't be helping you, going abroad is costly as fuck and it will be around 3 4 more years before you start getting paid. So think while everyone else is settling down after they enjoyed their youth you will still be a burden on your parents for about the next decade. So choose this course wisely and my only advice is you can coarse through it yes its brutal but its doable but only choose it for the service you will be providing to serve people around you if you just choose it for money then perhaps it would be dumb as there are many options where you earn more and early. This career here you won't vet to enjoy vacations , birthdays long holidays as much as other careers . And to end everyone doing whatever be it MBBS or anything else after results will make it in life so chin up everyone.|||Like MBBS padadai you can actually tutor Cee aspirant lots of money making oppuetunity, My own cousin is in 2nd year in this Dashain he earned so much!

After commenting on that post about the truth, he/she seems to delete the comment. Here is what happened:   As the deadline approaches, people started lining up on election commission offices in droves.  Some had to stay in line for couple of hours to possibly whole day for their biometric appointment alone. A bunch of activists (let's say youth) saw this and consulted with PM for finding a solution. PM office directed those activists to collaborate with election commission and Nation ID Center. First, the joint group made some legal consultations and then feasibility testing (finding out if the proposed idea is even possible) with technical teams of NID and Election commission people. It turned out it is possible to integrate data between those two commissions. Technical teams from both NID and Election commission worked for 2-3 day and night to come up with this solution. There is no involvement from third party hire or outsiders or even Youth per say. The non-technical GenZ youths never got access to the system. They were only consulted for UAT (User acceptance testing). **Don't trust me?, here is a story**:   [अनलाइनबाटै मतदाता नामावली : रातारात कसरी सम्भव भयो, जेनजी युवाले के योगदान गरे ? | Nepal's first 24-hour updated news portal - Ratopati](https://www.ratopati.com/story/523800/online-voter-registration-how-did-it-become-possible-overnight-what-contribution-did-genji-yuva-make)     As a person of IT background, I can also give out some possible technical details in the comments on how it has been possible to integrate data among two commissions.",

            "body": "Everyone is hyped when they are presented with \"Mega Deals\". Every year Daraz presents itself with 11.11 or 12.12 or similar \"Mega Sales\" events. I always felt Daraz sales were overhyped and were somehow dishonest, but yesterday I saw it for myself.  Most of you already know that Daraz overprices the same product in those said sales day and presents them as \"dashing 20% 25% 30% off\". Some products are really discounted by 2-3k, got to give credit for that. Yesterday was November 10, 2025, the day when Daraz promised rs.  11, rs.111, rs.1,111 or rs. 11,111 for limited number of products. They advertised as \"fast finger game\", where customers are supposed to put the said products in the cart and wait for the clock to hit exactly 8pm, then the said product's cost would drop to \"11-xxx\". I too was already looking to buy a tablet, Redmi Pad 2, which also was in the \"fast finger\" list.  Fast forward to 7:50pm, by this time I had already added Redmi Pad 2 in my cart, not only this, I had also added most of the \"fast finger\" products. To my surprise, when the clock hit 7:56pm, Redmi Pad 2 wasn't even in my cart, neither were those added \"fast finger\" products, daraz had removed them. When I searched for them, they were \"out of stock\" already, even before the clock hit 8pm! When the clock hit 8pm, I constantly refreshed varieties of those \"fast finger\" products, only to see them \"in stock\" and again \"out of stock\".  Here's what I think Daraz is doing: no one actually gets to buy a rs.1,000 product for rs.11, let alone a 25k tablet for 1k. Daraz creates high traffic by announcing such events and presents false transaction for hype. How can a product go out of stock even before 8pm, the time when they said would go on sale? Because in reality, people would be waiting for the super deal eagerly, wouldn't they? I only saw once a 30k product priced as 1,111rs., but when I tried to enter, their system said \"opps, error\" or something like that. Then the next minute it got in, but \"out of stock\". With every refresh, the \"out of stock\" changed from \"2 remaining\" to \"5 remaining\" and then again \"out of stock\", then again didn't show any quantity number(s) which meant fully restocked in seconds.  Daraz is only hurting it's image doing these fake \"MeGa\" sales. If only Daraz actually gave significant percentage discounts (20-50% real discount) for few days, their sales would sky rocket for real.  The only upside of this \"MeGa SaLes\" is Voucher Discounts. You can get 1.7k to 11k voucher discounts (at least yesterday those were real and available). Besides the voucher availability, Daraz 11.11 is nothing but a dishonest scheme!",

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

Traveled to two countries for free via a BIG COMPANY, Won so many tech competitions and made a good name in the tech community.

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here. One of my friends is supposedly earning 3lakhs+ monthly salary in Nepal.       TL:DR; I'd suggest at least study bachelors here and gain few years of professional experience before going abroad. You'll 100% not regret it.|||I will probably stay in nepal for a long time i am studying ca so i see opportunities definitely.

But looking at the situation of my friends and even myself when i was jobless for a while earlier, i wouldn't recommend staying here after +2.   Answering your other questions..

First comes the ML researchers/engineers who have built the machine learning models that are the base of everything AI/Ml. Think of Neural Network(perceptron) , SVM, etc.   Then people understood deep learning beats classical Ml, which led to growth of deep learning architectures like CNN, RNN/LSTM, alexnet, etc. Ml engineers do this too but now we do have dedicated deep learning engineers/computer vision engineer, etc.   Fast forward a few years ML research led to attention/MHA or the transformer architecture. This is the very architecture you see in chatgpt. Now the companies who had the capital/manpower/compute and energy resources trained multiple foundation models using this transformer architecture. Foundation Models like gpt-2/3.5.   This is where software engineers from such companies come in and inference these foundation models as APIs which anyone can use to build AI from there. This is typically what AI engineers do: use APIs of foundation models, fine tune existing models, prompt engineering, constant testing and validation to make the foundation models work as they want.   Aba to come to your point of building from scratch. Researchers research new ways to make our existing systems/architecture better. They read existing papers, try the methodology and experiment mentioned in that paper to innovate sth new or to improve aspects of existing architecture.    Now coming to building LLM from scratch, tyo pani pre-training huncha and post training. Pre training is the high compute, high resource burning and needs a lottttt of data. It’s like teaching an empty void everything we have in terms of data/information. Takes weeks/months. Pre training will create a good model.   Now post trainers take this model and incorporate RLHF, DPO, safety training, system prompt tuning, etc. basically they are making sure the pre-trained model behaves and aligns the way they want.   And timi wrong chau ML engineer only build LLM sochnu ma, if you can replace lets say an automation that is using AI foundation models and burning alot of $$$ for you company with a basic ML model thats uses much less compute and money but does the same job. Then you are ML engineer too🙃|||Ahh gardaichan, specially AI ML ahnee data eng duitai webscraping ahnee etl pipelina bauna ko lagi.|||ML ko dherai applications huncha , kah LLM ra chatbots matra ho ta.

On Reddit alone, there are tons of posts every day from folks offering web dev services or showing off their projects.  It makes sense, web development seems approachable at first. You pick up some HTML, CSS, and maybe some framework , and you can already build something that looks good. But once you dig a little deeper, things start getting complicated fast. Real web development isn’t just about putting pages together; it’s about understanding APIs, scalability, system design, security, and how all the moving parts connect behind the scenes.  A lot of beginners stop at that surface level and call themselves “web developers,” but frameworks can only take you so far. The real value comes from knowing what’s happening under the hood, that’s what separates someone who just builds websites from someone who builds reliable, scalable systems.  And honestly, it’s worth going even further. Explore backend engineering, cloud computing, DevOps, automation, or data systems. Those areas don’t just make you a better developer , they help you understand how the whole ecosystem works, beyond just how to make something look good on the screen.",

My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

From what I can tell, it restricts an individual’s freedom of expression. Yes, government school teachers are public servants, but what they do outside their working hours shouldn’t be the government’s concern. They have every right to hold opinions and express them. Also, how far do these restrictions actually go? Are teachers even allowed to show support for their preferred representatives on social media|||I think this is a right decision but I want some perspectives from the opposing side…|||people might think this will solve a problem. but it really doesn't matter. no one can enforce this in national scale.  problem arkai solution arkai.  School time ma, school ko responsibilities pura garna nasake ma punishment or fine hunnu parne regardless the reason. but saying teachers cannot participate in politics event is un enforceable. also this should be done by LokSewa not EC.  plus not only teacher every public service employee if goes to any event without proper holiday should be punished or fine, mero normal job jastai. i can participate but in my expense of time off. i can talk about politics in office too.  \"political events\" ma teacher le baag lina na paaune is un enforceable. freedom of expression ko against ma bhayo.   promotion of parties within schools can be prohibited  but easy workaround can do it just outside the schools. inside i understand it should be. but still un enforceable.   \"bias in teaching low garne re\", human bias ko against  enforce chai kasri garcha?  schools and universities are hot bed for politics and ideology, most democratic countries in universities and schools people participate in politics, that's where movements are born. only student movement topples governments. so thinking this is enforceable by a body like EC is absurd to me. good to appease people.   I am not saying these student unions currently aren't bad, they are spineless corrupt cowards, similar to teacher unions ko cowards but this is a just a document to appease people who think this is enforce able.   now every student (even for lols) will post the pictures of any teacher they find, imagine you fearing your right to expression. \"mob justice\"",

            "body": "I spent almost three hours at a café with Shibu one afternoon. It turned out to be one of the most emotional moments of my life.  With tears streaming down his face, he said, “Bhauju, when I was born, I didn’t even look like a human. People were scared to see me. I couldn’t bear to look at my childhood photos , so I gathered all of them and burned them.”    His eyes were full of tears as he said those words. After a pause, he added,   “When I was little, I was hit by a truck. I had a head injury, so even now I forget many things. Everyone in my family is fair and tall… I still wonder why I was born like this. Even today, my photo is posted at Kanti Hospital, maybe to show how horrible a disease can look.”   I sat there listening in silence. Later, when he went viral, he told me that reading the comments broke him again.  “For the first time, I realized how ugly people think I am. I locked myself in my room and cried, screaming. Maybe my parents were hurt even more than me.”   You compare him to animals in the comments, you laugh at his face, you write cruel things and yet, he still makes people laugh. Because he knows pain. He understands what real suffering feels like.  To those who find entertainment in someone else’s pain, I want to ask: If you had to live through what Shibu went through, would you have survived it?  Shibu shares laughter. You spread hate.  Mocking someone’s difference doesn’t make you great. A good human respects others, feels empathy, and loves even those who are different.  Yesterday was his birthday. The best gift you could give him this year? Don’t leave hateful comments.  Shibu is genuine, kind, and sensitive. Let him laugh, let him sing, let him live joyfully but please, stop hurting his dignity with your words.  : Dipa Simkhada      एक दिन मैले सिबुसँग क्याफेमा लगभग तीन घण्टा बिताएँ। त्यो समय मेरो लागि अत्यन्त भावनात्मक रह्यो। सिबुले आफ्नो कथा खोलेर मलाई सुनाउँदा उनि धुरुधुरु रोए । भाउजु ! म त जन्मँदा मान्छे जस्तो पनि थियिन नि , मान्छेहरू डराउँथे मलाई देखेर। मैले मेरो बाल्यकालका फोटोहरू हेर्न नसकेर म आफैले ती सबै तस्बिरहरू जम्मा गरे र जलाईदिए। यि वाक्यहरु बोल्दा उन्का आखा बाट आशु बरबर झरिरयो । केहि बेर सम्मालिएर उनले फेरि थपे  “ भाउजु म सानो हुदा मलाई ट्रकले हान्यो , टाउकोमा चोट लाग्यो त्यसैले अहिले पनि धेरै कुरा याद गर्न सक्दिन। घरमा सबै गोरो , अग्लो छन् खै म मात्र किन यस्तो जन्मे होला है । अझै पनि, कान्ति हस्पिटलमा मेरो शरीरको फोटो ठुलो बनाएर टासेका छन् , शायद देखाउनको लागि होला कि कुनै रोग कति सम्म भयानक हुन सक्छ भनेर । म सुनिरहे ….                 सबै कुरा बिर्सेर अगाडि बढे viral भएपछि पहिलो चोटि कमेन्ट पढ्दा फेरि म साच्चै नराम्रो रहेछु भन्ने थाहा भयो अनि ढोका थुनेर चिच्याएर रोए भाउजु। सायद मलाई भन्दा धेरै त मेरो बुवा मम्मिलाई दुख्यो होला । तपाईहरू कमेन्टमा उसलाई जनावरसँग तुलना गर्नुहुन्छ, उसको अनुहारमाथि हाँस्नुहुन्छ, अनेक शब्दहरू लेख्नुहुन्छ ,तर पनि ऊ सबैलाई हाँसाउने गर्छ, किनभने ऊ पीडा जान्दछ , दुखको दुख ऊ जान्दछ । कसैको पीडामा मनोरञ्जन खोज्नेहरूलाई सोध्न मन छ  शिबुको जत्ति पीडा तपाईको जीवनमा आयो भने के तपाई टिक्न सक्नुहुन्न? सिबुले त हाँसो बाँड्छ, तपाईंहरू त घृणाको बिष बाँड्दै हिड्नुहुन्छ ।                   उसको भिन्नतालाई  अपमान गर्दा, तपाई पक्कै महान्  बन्नुहुन्न । राम्रो मान्छेले  त अरूलाई सम्मान दिन्छ, संवेदनशील हुन्छ, र फरक मानिसलाई पनि माया गर्छ। हिजो उसको जन्मदिन थियो, उसलाई यो बर्ष दिन सकिने सबैभन्दा ठूलो उपहार भनेको नकारात्मक कमेन्ट नगरिदिनु हो। सिबु साँच्चिकै राम्रो, सच्चा, र संवेदनशील व्यक्ति हो। उसलाई हाँस्न दिनुहोस्, उसको रमाईले गितमा हास्नु , रमाउनु तर अपशब्द र गालिले उसको आत्मसम्मान, अतीत र पीडामा थप चोट पुर्याउनु बन्द गर्नुहोस्।",

Every cruel comment, every laugh at someone’s pain, every insult you throw is proof of how small, weak, and ugly you really are. You think you are clever. You think you are funny. You are none of that. You are a coward hiding behind a screen or a mask, feeding on someone else’s suffering because you cannot face your own emptiness.  People survive pain, illness, differences, loss, and hardship every single day. They fight battles you will never understand. And you? You sit there judging, mocking, calling them names, comparing them to animals, or shaming them for how they look, who they are, or how they live. That does not make you strong. That does not make you superior. That makes you weak. That makes you cruel. That makes you pathetic.  If you had to live one day of their life, one second of their struggle, you would crumble.. And yet you throw venom like it is a game. Your words are weapons. Your laughter is poison. You harm others because you cannot see your own brokenness.  So next time you feel like mocking, shaming, or hating, remember this: the world will remember your cruelty long after it forgets your name. And the people you hurt will rise above it while you remain small, bitter, and empty.  # Stop being a villain in someone else’s life. Start being human!|||How is this guy ugly?

            "body": "I’m in a real dilemma. This guy is my ex, also my teacher before, and he’s my neighbor too. We can’t ignore each other because we live in the same society. Our last romantic talk was more than 11 years ago, and me coming abroad and his marriage happened around the same time. He’s been married for 9 years and has an 8-year-old daughter. Even after we broke up and he got married, he would still text me from fake accounts, call me, and I kept disappearing from social media. Recently he found my account again, I accepted his request because it’s been over a decade and I thought things would be normal since we’re neighbors. But he’s still talking about those old things, and I feel bad for his wife. I think she knows about the relationship we had in the past and he himself said that he told her everything about us, and she doesn’t care. We’ll eventually meet in person, so I don’t know, should I tell her, or just act like nothing happened?  - More explanation - I was 13 and he was more than 20 when we started dating. He had 3 younger siblings, and the youngest sister was the same age as me. He became a teacher in our school, and his sister was my best friend and also my competitor. We were in 7th grade and he was our Social teacher. I feel ashamed when I think about that time now, because I don’t know why I got into a relationship with my teacher and my friend’s brother. We weren’t relatives, he’s Chhetri and I’m Yakkha. We used to call each other all the time at home, and in school we met every day, but we never kissed or did anything physical. Slowly I went from being a top student to becoming a weak one, and his sister became the school topper. After about two years of this kind of relationship, one day he asked me for sex I immediately said no and told him we should break up ( which I’m really proud of having the courage to say no and cut things off, cuz I was so emotionally glued to him ) Right after that, he got another girlfriend. I’ve forgotten many details, but that’s basically the backstory  ( I know many of you will judge me for having a relationship with a teacher at that age, and I own up to my mistakes. Now I want your harsh truth to help me get out of that guilt )",

They also tend to share those things, feeling proud, to their friends. Do make your sister aware of things. In relationship, those sexual things normally happens much much later as they both get really really close and secure or comfortable. It takes years of trust, patience and such. But those who solely get into relationship for sexual things, they starts to make moves from early days, gradually gradually getting to their aim. Those who don't get into relationship for sex, these things happens much much later as their language and conversation also starts to become rough, raw, unfiltered and such. I don't want to worry you, but this is what I have observed and understood so far. They start making moves to get to their aim (sex) early and slowly manipulating, exploiting, impressing and such. Take care.|||Teen curiosity. Awareness dinu parne ho. But at the same time, don't set the mindset where sex is a taboo. Make sure from her that it's with her consent, kunnai force or blackmail garera or \"if you love me, can't you do this much\" bhanera hoina. Tbh 14 is a young age to be indulging in a sexual relationship, even if it's the man of her dream. Biologically she ain't ready for that. So maybe try to reach her too.|||Before reacting, take a moment to calm down. Acting in anger or frustration could make things harder for both of you. Instead of confronting her publicly or harshly, have a calm conversation.

Be close with her, scolding or taking harsh actions may ruin the them more.|||**I am assuming and hoping that her boyfriend is also a minor.**  From my perspective:  I think it is unfair that you checked her without her permission. Let the tennager explore their sexuality.  There is a reason why kids are exposed to sex education in school at around 13-14ish..  Since you have already checked it, provide her the safe environment where she can share about her romantic life. Controlling is not the way to go here. If anything, tell her to use protection and happy exploring!",

Ekxin process garnai time lagyo malai k bhairaxa ..and she kept raising her voice and yelling. I opened my eyes and looked up. Realized It was actually a Mahila Seat. Couldn't believe my luck. Bus purai khali thiyo ma chadhne bela and I chose that seat of all seats. (2nd last seat FFS)  Stood up and gave her that seat. I just took a glance at her and the situation.

Equality means giving both genders the same rights, responsibilities, and opportunities, not extra privileges. A separate seat for women might have been created for safety and comfort when society was not safe for them, but if we are moving toward real equality, then continuing this only shows that women still need protection instead of being seen as capable and strong. True equality should mean creating a society where everyone feels safe and respected without needing special seats or treatment.|||Equality vanera male Lai chai khoi ta equality?K mahila seat matrai hunu paryo aba yr (pregnant,old age,periods) lady Lai as a basic manners le jasley ni help garnu parxa but male Lai chai gaaro hunna ra ??Ik female Lai ni garo hunxa but male Lai chai hunna ani ?Correct me if I am wrong always ready to learn...",

And being north of these countries, well , you get plenty of emissions carried by the wind which dissipates in our mountain ranges.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before.

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||When you leave Nepal and meet fellow Nepalese, you will continue this tradition.|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away.

Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

I respect him for his contribution in reformation in electricity of Nepal. But that don’t give him excuse to whatever theater he is creating now.  He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions. Mahesh karauna thale dekhi he is kind of caved in totally and his silence has taken many hopes from people.",

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

Moved from MERN stack to NextJs.   Totally not confident in my skills, with little to no projects to show. I've been looking for an internship but I am aware that my skills are really lacking for the current job market.   And I have nothing to show case as my portfolio. So even though I got a refer in a company I keep delaying it.   I honestly feel pathetic for this.   But I currently am focusing on doing about 2 decent projects and applying for internship.   Can we connect here anonymously for now?   I honestly need a mentor, not someone who will teach me how to code but instead show me what I should do.   To Show me the way forward.   I am not asking a full on professional guidance but just Yknow pointing at a road to me. Even that would mean a world to be man.   Thanks a bunch!

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?

Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail.

So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track.

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them.

Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

If you love mountains then visit Muktinath temple in Mustang.||| Travel Package link?|||Chitwan lumbini Nagarkot Panauti all the 4 durbar squares are good too|||Wow! Look at those towering mountains. So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before.

And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend?

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option.

It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area.

Some accused them of abandoning Nepal, saying things like “They should be banned from entering Nepal” or “Their Nepali citizenship must be immediately revoked.” Others even called them traitors and insulted the Nepali government for allowing it.  But in a surprising twist, it was later revealed that the couple weren’t Nepali at all—they were from Sri Lanka and had never even been to Nepal.  When the truth came out, both the Sri Lankan couple and the Nepali commenters were left shocked.  This incident, sparked merely by assumptions based on their Nepali looking faces, became a reflection of how quickly and blindly many react online without knowing the full story.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

Being an intern at Web Studio Nepal i found every team member are frustrated on work because of not getting salary for long period of time. Everyone contribute our 100% and not get paid and most of us left jobs there. Still the company doesn’t care about you and ignore the messages. Don’t hire if you don’t want to paid someone family is waiting and someone is building their future. #unpaidintern #frustatedemployee",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||“People believe anything when it’s put between quotation marks.”   — *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

Everyone was told not to mix, so families did the matchmaking. Also, Nepal actually has more women than men, so statistically it’s not a supply issue, even without arranged marriages, people will still get married because, well, people are gonna to get married.|||Our society is weird on relationships and all. I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?

We told her that we were Nepali citizen and didn’t needed visa. Then ahead rudely shouted to get the bording pass from the person who made that rule. Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out. Thr lady couldnhave just asked her senior and would have know the reason but instead decided that she isn’t there to serve but to rule. The problem ia that these people aren’t deceplined for their actions and continue to melign the name of their own country.|||As an Indian, I'm very sorry that Nepalis have to go through this in India. I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating. I really want those officials punished for misusing their authority and especially because their actions have cost someone an important career opportunity.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge! Maybe the reason is recent protest and many criminals were out of jail. But The hotel manager knew that they weren't bad people, but didn't allow them.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family.

No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||J pani overdramatic banauna parni hau Nepali harulai..

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!! Pic 7 year ago this day.  My last bhai tika.",

I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me.

Everything is so rapid and it's hard to grasp everything.      The bitter part for me is teachers and even classmates to some extent are strangers. I love how in school everyone knew and had different connection with every other teacher but here they just yap and go. The bond with classmates isn't great yet but I hope I will make some lifelong buddies out there.  The course is kinda hard as well and the competition is crazy asf. Einsteins here and there. Never failed an exam but for the first time in my life I think I am gonna be just-pass in Physics, man I hope I won't fail.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I thought I’d go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that… but now, I don’t even feel like staying in science. Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me — social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6. Only a handful number of teachers teaches the best while others simply recite what is shown on the slides.|||Chem is all about consistency daily class na oadhako concept bujni ho ani al din aagadi mop up garera ni sakkincha|||Ma ta cheat chorera pass vako ho yaar :)|||Well 11 is not like 10, you have to study, hunatw ma ni ekdin agadi padera +2 katako ho, but chemistry ko lagi chai you need to revise reaction haru.

MAA KASSAM YESAI MA BIGRINE HO!  tried and tested, got like 68 in chemistry first term|||bro same chem ruined my streak too. what helped me was making reaction charts by topic and revising them daily for 10 mins. patterns started clicking after a while, especially when i wrote them not just read.|||same mann also i got hit by karma didnt study shi and now im gonna choke in re exams cuz i dont understand anything|||I think and I felt as well that chemistry is kinda easy if you know how the chemical reactions work rather than just memorizing it. Focus on breaking compound molecules and try to react with another compound like naturally. You will be able to do every reactions|||school level shit is still easy. You just gotta study consistently|||Go to a shop and buy a lot of sticky notes. Write a reaction on one side and and information on other aide. Carry it wherever you go and memorize the hell out of it even when you are shititng on the toilet . There are no other reasons.
